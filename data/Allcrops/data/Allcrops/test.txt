BACKGROUND: O 0
Genetic O 0
maps O 0
are O 0
based O 0
on O 0
recombination O 0
of O 0
orthologous O 0
gene O 0
sequences O 0
between O 0
different O 0
strains O 0
of O 0
the O 0
same O 0
species. O 0

Therefore, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
unexpected O 0
to O 0
find O 0
extensive O 0
non-collinearity O 0
of O 0
genes O 0
between O 0
different O 0
inbred O 0
strains O 0
of O 0
maize. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
disruption O 0
of O 0
gene O 0
collinearity O 0
can O 0
be O 0
caused O 0
among O 0
others O 0
by O 0
a O 0
rolling O 0
circle-type O 0
copy O 0
and O 0
paste O 0
mechanism O 0
facilitated O 0
by O 0
Helitrons. O 0

However, O 0
understanding O 0
the O 0
role O 0
of O 0
this O 0
type O 0
of O 0
gene O 0
amplification O 0
has O 0
been O 0
hampered O 0
by O 0
the O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
finding O 0
intact O 0
gene O 0
sequences O 0
within O 0
Helitrons. O 0

RESULTS: O 0
By O 0
aligning O 0
two O 0
haplotypes O 0
of O 0
the O 0
z1C1 O 0
locus O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
we O 0
found O 0
a O 0
Helitron O 0
that O 0
contains O 0
two O 0
genes, O 0
one O 0
encoding O 0
a O 0
putative O 0
cytidine O 0
deaminase O 0
and O 0
one O 0
a O 0
hypothetical O 0
protein O 0
with O 0
part O 0
of O 0
a O 0
40S O 0
ribosomal O 0
protein. O 0

The O 0
cytidine O 0
deaminase O 0
gene, O 0
called O 0
ZmCDA3, O 0
has O 0
been O 0
copied O 0
from O 0
the O 0
ZmCDA1 O 0
gene O 0
on O 0
maize O 0
chromosome O 0
7 O 0
about O 0
4.5 O 0
million O 0
years O 0
ago O 0
(mya) O 0
after O 0
maize O 0
was O 0
formed O 0
by O 0
whole-genome O 0
duplication O 0
from O 0
two O 0
progenitors. O 0

Inbred O 0
lines O 0
contain O 0
gene O 0
copies O 0
of O 0
both O 0
progenitors, O 0
the O 0
ZmCDA1 O 0
and O 0
ZmCDA2 O 0
genes. O 0

Both O 0
genes O 0
diverged O 0
when O 0
the O 0
progenitors O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
split O 0
and O 0
are O 0
derived O 0
from O 0
the O 0
same O 0
progenitor O 0
as O 0
the O 0
rice O 0
OsCDA1 O 0
gene. O 0

The O 0
ZmCDA1 O 0
and O 0
ZmCDA2 O 0
genes O 0
are O 0
both O 0
transcribed O 0
in O 0
leaf O 0
and O 0
seed O 0
tissue, O 0
but O 0
transcripts O 0
of O 0
the O 0
paralogous O 0
ZmCDA3 O 0
gene O 0
have O 0
not O 0
been O 0
found O 0
yet. O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
their O 0
protein O 0
structure O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
CDA O 0
genes O 0
encode O 0
a O 0
nucleoside O 0
deaminase O 0
that O 0
is O 0
found O 0
in O 0
bacterial O 0
systems O 0
and O 0
is O 0
distinct O 0
from O 0
the O 0
mammalian O 0
RNA O 0
and/or O 0
DNA O 0
modifying O 0
enzymes. O 0

CONCLUSION: O 0
The O 0
conservation O 0
of O 0
a O 0
paralogous O 0
gene O 0
sequence O 0
encoding O 0
a O 0
cytidine O 0
deaminase O 0
gene O 0
over O 0
4.5 O 0
million O 0
years O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
Helitrons O 0
could O 0
add O 0
functional O 0
gene O 0
sequences O 0
to O 0
new O 0
chromosomal O 0
positions O 0
and O 0
thereby O 0
create O 0
new O 0
haplotypes. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
function O 0
of O 0
such O 0
paralogous O 0
gene O 0
copies O 0
cannot O 0
be O 0
essential O 0
because O 0
they O 0
are O 0
not O 0
present O 0
in O 0
all O 0
maize O 0
strains. O 0

However, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
interesting O 0
to O 0
note O 0
that O 0
maize O 0
hybrids O 0
can O 0
outperform O 0
their O 0
inbred O 0
parents. O 0

Therefore, O 0
certain O 0
haplotypes O 0
may O 0
function O 0
only O 0
in O 0
combination O 0
with O 0
other O 0
haplotypes O 0
or O 0
under O 0
specialized O 0
environmental O 0
conditions. O 0

In O 0
recent O 0

a O 0
growing O 0

that O 0

in O 0
regulating O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
a O 0

was O 0
screened O 0
from O 0
an O 0
EMS-induced O 0

The O 0

as O 0
KS, O 0
which O 0
encodes O 0
an O 0

(KS) O 0
enzyme O 0
functioning O 0
in O 0
the O 0

The O 0

A O 0

the O 0

was O 0
significantly O 0
higher O 0
than O 0
that O 0

The O 0

In O 0

that O 0
a O 0

The O 0

Transposable O 0

are O 0
known O 0
to O 0

important O 0
roles O 0
in O 0

yet O 0
questions O 0
remain O 0
as O 0
to O 0
how O 0
transposable O 0
elements O 0
alter O 0
genome O 0
structure O 0
and O 0
affect O 0
gene O 0
expression. O 0

Previous O 0
studies O 0
have O 0
shown O 0
that O 0
genome O 0
rearrangements O 0
can O 0
be O 0
induced O 0
by O 0
Reversed O 0
Ends O 0
Transposition O 0
involving O 0

of O 0
Activator O 0
and O 0
related O 0
transposable O 0
elements O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
and O 0
other O 0
plants. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
complex O 0
alleles O 0
can O 0
be O 0
formed O 0
by O 0
the O 0
rapid O 0
and O 0
progressive O 0
accumulation O 0
of O 0
Activator-induced O 0
duplications O 0
and O 0
rearrangements. O 0

The O 0
p1 O 0
gene O 0
enhancer O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
can O 0
induce O 0
ectopic O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
the O 0
nearby O 0
p2 O 0
gene O 0
in O 0
pericarp O 0
tissue O 0
when O 0
placed O 0
near O 0
it O 0
via O 0
different O 0
structural O 0
rearrangements. O 0

By O 0
screening O 0
for O 0
p2 O 0
expression, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
and O 0
studied O 0
5 O 0
cases O 0
in O 0
which O 0
multiple O 0
sequential O 0
transposition O 0
events O 0
occurred O 0
and O 0
increased O 0
the O 0
p1 O 0
enhancer O 0
copy O 0
number. O 0

We O 0
see O 0
active O 0
p2 O 0
expression O 0
due O 0
to O 0
multiple O 0
copies O 0
of O 0
the O 0
p1 O 0
enhancer O 0
present O 0
near O 0
p2 O 0
in O 0
all O 0
5 O 0
cases. O 0

The O 0
p1 O 0
enhancer O 0
effects O 0
are O 0
confirmed O 0
by O 0
the O 0
observation O 0
that O 0
loss O 0
of O 0
p2 O 0
expression O 0
is O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
transposition-induced O 0
excision O 0
of O 0
the O 0
p1 O 0
enhancers. O 0

We O 0
also O 0
performed O 0
a O 0

Together, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
show O 0
that O 0
transposon-induced O 0
rearrangements O 0
can O 0
accumulate O 0
rapidly O 0
and O 0
progressively O 0

The O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

shrunken-2 O 0
(Sh2) O 0
gene O 0
encodes O 0
the O 0
large O 0
subunit O 0
of O 0
the O 0
rate-limiting O 0

enzyme, O 0
ADP-glucose O 0

the O 0
enzyme O 0
with O 0
enhanced O 0

stability O 0
and O 0
reduced O 0
phosphate O 0
inhibition O 0
increased O 0
maize O 0
yield O 0
up O 0
to O 0
64%. O 0

The O 0
extent O 0
of O 0
the O 0
yield O 0
increase O 0
is O 0
dependent O 0
on O 0
temperatures O 0
during O 0
the O 0
first O 0

post O 0
pollination, O 0
and O 0
yield O 0
is O 0
increased O 0
if O 0
average O 0
daily O 0
high O 0
temperatures O 0
exceed O 0
33��C. O 0

As O 0
found O 0
in O 0
wheat O 0
(Triticum O 0
aestivum) O 0
and O 0
rice O 0
(Oryza O 0
sativa), O 0
this O 0
transgene O 0
increases O 0
maize O 0
yield O 0
by O 0
increasing O 0
seed O 0
number. O 0

This O 0
result O 0
was O 0
surprising, O 0
since O 0
an O 0
entire O 0
series O 0
of O 0
historic O 0
observations O 0
at O 0
the O 0
whole-plant, O 0
enzyme, O 0
gene, O 0
and O 0
physiological O 0
levels O 0
pointed O 0
to O 0
Sh2 O 0
playing O 0
an O 0
important O 0
role O 0
only O 0
in O 0
the O 0
endosperm. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
present O 0
several O 0
lines O 0
of O 0
evidence O 0
that O 0
lead O 0
to O 0
the O 0
conclusion O 0
that O 0
the O 0
Sh2 O 0
transgene O 0
functions O 0
in O 0
maternal O 0
tissue O 0
to O 0
increase O 0
seed O 0
number O 0
and, O 0
in O 0
turn, O 0
yield. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
the O 0
transgene O 0
does O 0
not O 0
increase O 0
ovary O 0
number; O 0
rather, O 0
it O 0
increases O 0
the O 0
probability O 0
that O 0
a O 0
seed O 0
will O 0
develop. O 0

Surprisingly, O 0
the O 0
number O 0
of O 0
fully O 0
developed O 0
seeds O 0
is O 0
only O 0
&#8764;50% O 0
of O 0
the O 0
number O 0
of O 0
ovaries O 0
in O 0
wild-type O 0
maize. O 0

This O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
increasing O 0
the O 0
frequency O 0
of O 0
seed O 0
development O 0
is O 0
a O 0
feasible O 0
agricultural O 0
target, O 0
especially O 0
under O 0
conditions O 0
of O 0
elevated O 0

In O 0
summary, O 0
the O 0
work O 0
by O 0
Huang O 0
et O 0

not O 0
only O 0
makes O 0
a O 0

basis O 0
toward O 0

between O 0

but O 0
also O 0
uncovers O 0
an O 0
unexpected O 0
solution O 0
for O 0
NUE O 0
improvement O 0
that O 0
brought O 0
by O 0
an O 0
ancient O 0
allele. O 0

The O 0
speculation O 0
that O 0
THP9-T O 0
allele O 0
is O 0
neglected O 0
during O 0
maize O 0
domestication O 0
reminds O 0
us O 0
of O 0
a O 0
similar O 0
pattern O 0
that O 0
the O 0
ancient O 0
allele O 0
of O 0
OsTCP19 O 0
undergone O 0
in O 0
rice, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
largely O 0
lost O 0
in O 0
modern O 0
rice O 0

due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
overloading O 0
of O 0

(Liu O 0

2021). O 0

Therefore, O 0
retracing O 0
more O 0

would O 0
be O 0

Northern O 0

what O 0
appeared O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0

Two O 0
polypeptides O 0
appear O 0
in O 0
the O 0
cell O 0

where O 0
one O 0
polypeptide O 0
is O 0
constitutive, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
second O 0
appears O 0
at O 0
the O 0

of O 0
the O 0
maximum O 0

of O 0
elongation O 0
and O 0
reaches O 0
peak O 0

after O 0

The O 0
appearance O 0
of O 0
the O 0
second O 0

coincides O 0
with O 0
the O 0
disappearance O 0
of O 0
the O 0

(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan, O 0
whose O 0

The O 0
third O 0

of O 0
the O 0

is O 0
an O 0

Although O 0
the O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
the O 0
membrane-associated O 0
ExGase O 0
is O 0
highest O 0
against O 0
(1-->3)-beta-D-glucans, O 0
the O 0
activity O 0
against O 0
(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan O 0
linkages O 0
is O 0
severely O 0
attenuated O 0
and, O 0
therefore, O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
is O 0
unlikely O 0
to O 0
be O 0
involved O 0
with O 0
turnover O 0
of O 0
the O 0

MNB1a O 0

a O 0

that O 0
contains O 0
a O 0

and O 0
its O 0

In O 0
this O 0

two O 0
maize O 0

were O 0

Although O 0
these O 0

the O 0

RNA O 0

however, O 0
this O 0

Although O 0
these O 0

that O 0
the O 0

evolved O 0
via O 0

the O 0

seemed O 0
to O 0
have O 0
no O 0
introns O 0
in O 0
the O 0

These O 0

Maize O 0

one O 0

the O 0
most O 0

in O 0
the O 0

the O 0

Understanding O 0

Phosphorus O 0
is O 0
the O 0
least O 0
mobile O 0
macronutrient O 0
in O 0
the O 0
soils O 0
and O 0
it O 0
is O 0
often O 0

In O 0
this O 0
work, O 0
five O 0
genes O 0
encoding O 0
Pht1 O 0
phosphate O 0
transporters O 0
which O 0
contribute O 0
to O 0
phosphate O 0
uptake O 0
and O 0

in O 0
maize O 0
were O 0
identified. O 0

In O 0
phosphate-starved O 0
plants, O 0
transcripts O 0
of O 0
most O 0
of O 0
the O 0
five O 0
transporters O 0
were O 0
present O 0
in O 0
roots O 0
and O 0
leaves. O 0

Independent O 0
of O 0
the O 0
phosphate O 0
supply, O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
two O 0
genes O 0
was O 0
predominant O 0
in O 0
pollen O 0
or O 0
in O 0
roots O 0
colonized O 0
by O 0
symbiotic O 0
mycorrhizal O 0
fungi, O 0
respectively. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
high O 0
transcript O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
the O 0
mycorrhiza-inducible O 0
gene O 0
were O 0
also O 0
detectable O 0
in O 0

of O 0
phosphate-starved O 0

Thus, O 0
differential O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
Pht1 O 0

in O 0

suggests O 0

In O 0

Here, O 0
through O 0
the O 0

we O 0

many O 0

Several O 0

The O 0

The O 0

encodes O 0
a O 0
putative O 0

factor, O 0
which O 0
directly O 0

A O 0
plant O 0
nuclear O 0
protein O 0
PEP-I, O 0
which O 0
binds O 0
specifically O 0
to O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
region O 0
of O 0
the O 0
phosphoenolpyruvate O 0

(PEPC) O 0
gene, O 0
was O 0

Methylation O 0

analysis O 0
and O 0
DNA O 0

assays O 0
using O 0
synthetic O 0
oligonucleotides O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
PEP-I O 0
binds O 0
to O 0
GC-rich O 0
elements. O 0

These O 0
elements O 0
are O 0
directly O 0
repeated O 0
sequences O 0
in O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
region O 0
of O 0
the O 0
PEPC O 0
gene O 0
and O 0
we O 0
have O 0
suggested O 0
that O 0
they O 0
may O 0
be O 0
cis-regulatory O 0
elements O 0
of O 0
this O 0
gene. O 0

The O 0
consensus O 0
sequence O 0
of O 0
the O 0
element O 0
is O 0
CCCTCTCCACATCC O 0
and O 0
the O 0
CTCC O 0
is O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
binding O 0
of O 0
PEP-I. O 0

PEP-I O 0
is O 0
present O 0
in O 0
the O 0
nuclear O 0
extracts O 0
of O 0
green O 0
leaves, O 0
where O 0
the O 0
PEPC O 0
gene O 0
is O 0
expressed. O 0

However, O 0
no O 0
binding O 0
was O 0
detected O 0
in O 0
tissues O 0
where O 0
the O 0
PEPC O 0
gene O 0
is O 0
not O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0

such O 0
as O 0
roots O 0
or O 0
etiolated O 0

Thus, O 0
PEP-I O 0
is O 0
the O 0
first O 0
factor O 0
identified O 0
in O 0

which O 0
has O 0

with O 0

PEP-I O 0

is O 0
also O 0
tissue-specific, O 0
suggesting O 0
that O 0
PEP-I O 0
may O 0

Six O 0

have O 0
been O 0

An O 0

is O 0
whether O 0

The O 0

the O 0

determined O 0
what O 0
types O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
each O 0

was O 0
preferentially O 0
targeted O 0
by O 0
a O 0

To O 0

This O 0

identified O 0
the O 0

(SSs) O 0
present O 0

The O 0

of O 0
the O 0

DU1, O 0
was O 0
shown O 0
to O 0
be O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
two O 0
major O 0

The O 0

This O 0

DU1 O 0
was O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
Escherichia O 0

and O 0
shown O 0

200 O 0
kD O 0
that O 0
was O 0
lacking O 0

These O 0

eliminated O 0
20% O 0

30% O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Antiserum O 0

eliminated O 0
approximately O 0
60% O 0

immunodepletion O 0

this O 0

Two O 0

by O 0
electrophoretic O 0

each O 0

which O 0
correlated O 0

zSSI O 0

Thus, O 0
DU1 O 0

the O 0

The O 0

did O 0
not O 0
change O 0
significantly O 0

the O 0

DU1 O 0
and O 0
zSSI O 0
may O 0
be O 0
interdependent, O 0
because O 0
mutant O 0

The O 0

the O 0

Determination O 0
of O 0
the O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

both O 0

a O 0

The O 0
positioning O 0
of O 0
the O 0
introns O 0
is O 0
conserved O 0

the O 0

by O 0
which O 0
the O 0

developmental O 0
stage-transition O 0
mechanisms O 0
and O 0

The O 0
existence O 0
of O 0
both O 0

is O 0
indicated O 0
by O 0
the O 0
behavior O 0
of O 0
various O 0

Shoot O 0

in O 0
at O 0

seven O 0

this O 0

The O 0

type O 0

time-to-flowering. O 0

As O 0

time-to-flowering O 0

The O 0

Gray O 0

the O 0
most O 0
destructive O 0
foliar O 0
diseases O 0
affecting O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
a O 0
gene, O 0
ZmCPK39, O 0
that O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0
calcium-dependent O 0
protein O 0
kinase O 0
and O 0
negatively O 0
regulates O 0
quantitative O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
these O 0
three O 0
diseases. O 0

The O 0
ZmCPK39 O 0
allele O 0
in O 0
the O 0
resistant O 0
line O 0
displayed O 0
significantly O 0
lower O 0
pathogen-induced O 0
gene O 0
expression O 0
than O 0
that O 0
in O 0
the O 0
susceptible O 0
line. O 0

A O 0
marked O 0
decrease O 0
in O 0
ZmCPK39 O 0
abundance O 0
mitigated O 0
the O 0
phosphorylation O 0
and O 0
degradation O 0
of O 0
the O 0
transcription O 0
factor O 0
ZmDi19. O 0

This O 0
led O 0
to O 0
elevated O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
ZmPR10, O 0
a O 0
gene O 0
known O 0
to O 0
encode O 0
an O 0
antimicrobial O 0
protein, O 0
thereby O 0
enhancing O 0
maize O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
foliar O 0
diseases. O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0
F1 O 0
hybrid O 0
with O 0
reduced O 0
ZmCPK39 O 0
expression O 0
favored O 0
disease O 0
resistance, O 0
thereby O 0
increasing O 0
yield. O 0

Hence, O 0
the O 0
discovery O 0
of O 0
the O 0
ZmCPK39–ZmDi19–ZmPR10 O 0

provides O 0

into O 0
the O 0

underlying O 0
broad-spectrum O 0

which O 0
is O 0
encoded O 0
by O 0
the O 0

is O 0

The O 0

Plants O 0
expressing O 0

of O 0

were O 0
methomyl O 0

Subcellular O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0
URF13 O 0
is O 0
mainly O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
the O 0

Adding O 0

stimulated O 0
NADH-linked O 0

indicating O 0
that O 0
URF13 O 0
was O 0
imported O 0
into O 0
the O 0

conferred O 0

Subcellular O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
URF13 O 0
sedimented O 0

several O 0
positions, O 0
suggesting O 0
the O 0
protein O 0
is O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
various O 0

No O 0
methomyl O 0

was O 0
observed O 0
in O 0

however, O 0
indicating O 0
that O 0

and O 0
did O 0
not O 0
confer O 0

Thus, O 0

We O 0

account O 0
for O 0
the O 0
data, O 0
that O 0
Tdy1 O 0

or O 0
that O 0

To O 0
determine O 0
whether O 0

might O 0
function O 0
in O 0
starch O 0
breakdown, O 0
we O 0
exposed O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0

retain O 0
large O 0

consistent O 0
with O 0
a O 0

To O 0
further O 0

this O 0

we O 0

We O 0
determined O 0
that O 0
the O 0
agps-m1 O 0

is O 0
a O 0
molecular O 0
null O 0
and O 0
that O 0

PPSB O 0
was O 0
overexpressed O 0
in O 0
plants O 0
exhibiting O 0
two O 0

under O 0
ambient O 0

Overexpression O 0
in O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
of O 0
the O 0

alone O 0
or O 0
PGDH1, O 0
PSAT1 O 0

These O 0

Likewise, O 0
starch O 0

were O 0
also O 0
increased O 0

this O 0
translated O 0
into O 0
a O 0
significant O 0

These O 0
results O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
metabolic O 0

could O 0

During O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0

The O 0

been O 0

Here O 0
we O 0

Kiwellins O 0
is O 0
apparently O 0

We O 0
combined O 0
the O 0

to O 0
obtain O 0
a O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
Kiwellins O 0
are O 0
evolutionarily O 0

in O 0
various O 0

At O 0
median O 0
five O 0

cannot O 0
be O 0

purely O 0

Our O 0

They O 0

We O 0

A O 0
meta-analysis O 0

demonstrated O 0
that O 0

upon O 0
the O 0

also O 0

Furthermore, O 0

In O 0

the O 0

the O 0
interaction O 0

the O 0

Further, O 0
we O 0

we O 0

facilitates O 0
the O 0

it O 0

To O 0

we O 0

These O 0

enabled O 0
the O 0

which O 0
were O 0
designated O 0

respectively. O 0

ASP1 O 0
and O 0
ASP2, O 0
when O 0
linked O 0

ZM-AA1ΔSP, O 0
exhibited O 0
the O 0
capability O 0
to O 0
disrupt O 0

whereas O 0
ASP3 O 0
and O 0
ASP4 O 0
did O 0
not O 0
produce O 0
this O 0
effect. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
the O 0
localization O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
ASP3 O 0
and O 0
ASP4 O 0
were O 0
able O 0

Additionally, O 0
the O 0

As O 0

The O 0

protein O 0

In O 0
this O 0

A O 0

was O 0
purified. O 0

The O 0

showed O 0

that O 0
was O 0

The O 0

this O 0

These O 0

that O 0
the O 0

PKC O 0
in O 0
gene O 0

the O 0
nitrate O 0

was O 0
investigated. O 0

The O 0
transcript O 0

increased O 0
by O 0
PMA, O 0
not O 0
by O 0
4alpha-PMA O 0

the O 0

not O 0
by O 0
