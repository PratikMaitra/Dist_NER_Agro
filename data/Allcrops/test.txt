Taken O 0

In O 0
the O 0

a O 0

was O 0
used O 0
to O 0

were O 0
performed O 0
in O 0

Our O 0

FLOWERING O 0

genes O 0
encode O 0
proteins O 0
that O 0
function O 0
as O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
characterized O 0
five O 0
FT-like O 0
genes O 0
from O 0
the O 0
model O 0
legume, O 0
Medicago O 0
(Medicago O 0

The O 0
different O 0
FT O 0
genes O 0
showed O 0
distinct O 0
patterns O 0
of O 0
expression O 0
and O 0
responses O 0
to O 0
environmental O 0
cues. O 0

Three O 0
of O 0
the O 0
FT O 0
genes O 0
(MtFTa1, O 0
MtFTb1, O 0
and O 0
MtFTc) O 0
were O 0
able O 0
to O 0
complement O 0
the O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
(Arabidopsis O 0
thaliana) O 0
ft-1 O 0
mutant, O 0
suggesting O 0
that O 0
they O 0
are O 0
capable O 0
of O 0
functioning O 0
as O 0
florigen. O 0

MtFTa1 O 0
is O 0
the O 0
only O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
FT O 0
genes O 0
that O 0
is O 0
up-regulated O 0
by O 0
both O 0
long O 0
days O 0
(LDs) O 0
and O 0
vernalization, O 0
conditions O 0
that O 0
promote O 0
Medicago O 0
flowering, O 0
and O 0
transgenic O 0
Medicago O 0
plants O 0
overexpressing O 0
the O 0
MtFTa1 O 0
gene O 0
flowered O 0
very O 0
rapidly. O 0

The O 0
key O 0
role O 0
MtFTa1 O 0
plays O 0
in O 0
regulating O 0
flowering O 0
was O 0
demonstrated O 0
by O 0
the O 0
identification O 0
of O 0
fta1 O 0
mutants O 0
that O 0
flowered O 0
significantly O 0
later O 0
in O 0
all O 0
conditions O 0
examined. O 0

fta1 O 0
mutants O 0
do O 0
not O 0
respond O 0
to O 0
vernalization O 0
but O 0
are O 0
still O 0
responsive O 0
to O 0
LDs, O 0
indicating O 0
that O 0
the O 0
induction O 0
of O 0
flowering O 0
by O 0
prolonged O 0
cold O 0
acts O 0
solely O 0
through O 0
MtFTa1, O 0
whereas O 0
photoperiodic O 0
induction O 0
of O 0
flowering O 0
involves O 0
other O 0
genes, O 0
possibly O 0
MtFTb1, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
only O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
leaves O 0
under O 0
LD O 0
conditions O 0
and O 0
therefore O 0
might O 0
contribute O 0
to O 0
the O 0
photoperiodic O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0
flowering. O 0

The O 0
role O 0
of O 0
the O 0
MtFTc O 0
gene O 0
is O 0
unclear, O 0
as O 0
the O 0
ftc O 0
mutants O 0
did O 0
not O 0
have O 0
any O 0
obvious O 0
flowering-time O 0
or O 0
other O 0
phenotypes. O 0

Overall, O 0
this O 0
work O 0
reveals O 0
the O 0
diversity O 0

the O 0

These O 0

The O 0
first O 0
objective O 0
of O 0
this O 0
study O 0
was O 0
to O 0
identify O 0
and O 0
locate O 0
genes O 0
responsible O 0
for O 0
FG O 0
biosynthesis O 0
in O 0
the O 0

The O 0
second O 0
objective O 0
was O 0
to O 0
clone O 0
and O 0
verify O 0
the O 0
function O 0
of O 0
these O 0
candidate O 0

Recombinant O 0

(RILs) O 0
were O 0
developed O 0
by O 0
crossing O 0
the O 0

The O 0

were O 0
separated O 0
by O 0
high O 0

and O 0
identified. O 0

The O 0
FGs O 0
of O 0
Koganejiro O 0
had O 0
rhamnose O 0
at O 0
the O 0
6″-position O 0
of O 0
the O 0
glucose O 0

to O 0
the O 0

whereas O 0
FGs O 0
of O 0
Kitakomachi O 0
were O 0
devoid O 0
of O 0
rhamnose. O 0

Among O 0
the O 0
94 O 0
RILs, O 0
53 O 0
RILs O 0
had O 0

and O 0
41 O 0
RILs O 0
had O 0

The O 0
segregation O 0
fitted O 0
a O 0
1:1 O 0
ratio, O 0
suggesting O 0
that O 0
a O 0
single O 0

gene O 0
in O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0

group O 0
O O 0
(chromosome O 0

The O 0
coding O 0
region O 0
of O 0
the O 0
gene O 0
from O 0
Koganejiro, O 0
designated O 0
as O 0
GmF3G6″Rt-a, O 0
is O 0
1,392 O 0
bp O 0
long O 0
and O 0
encodes O 0
464 O 0
amino O 0
acids, O 0
whereas O 0
the O 0
gene O 0
of O 0
Kitakomachi, O 0
GmF3G6″Rt-b, O 0
has O 0
a O 0
two-base O 0
deletion O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0
a O 0
truncated O 0
polypeptide O 0
consisting O 0
of O 0
314 O 0
amino O 0

The O 0
recombinant O 0
GmF3G6″Rt-a O 0
protein O 0
converted O 0
kaempferol O 0
3-O-glucoside O 0
to O 0
kaempferol O 0
3-O-rutinoside O 0
and O 0
utilized O 0
3-O-glucosylated/galactosylated O 0
flavonols O 0
and O 0
UDP-rhamnose O 0
as O 0
substrates. O 0

GmF3G6″Rt-b O 0
protein O 0
had O 0
no O 0
activity. O 0

These O 0
results O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
GmF3G6″Rt O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0
flavonol O 0
3-O-glucoside O 0
(1 O 0

rhamnosyltransferase O 0
and O 0
it O 0
probably O 0
corresponds O 0
to O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
natural O 0

not O 0
been O 0

The O 0

were O 0
the O 0
identification O 0

The O 0

at O 0
the O 0

about O 0
62-66 O 0
% O 0

The O 0

the O 0
E1-E4 O 0

suggests O 0
the O 0

Polyploidy O 0
is O 0
a O 0
common O 0
phenomenon, O 0
particularly O 0
in O 0

The O 0
soybean O 0
(Glycine O 0

[L.] O 0
Merr.) O 0
genome O 0
has O 0
undergone O 0
two O 0
whole O 0

duplication O 0
(WGD) O 0
events. O 0

The O 0
conservation O 0
and O 0
divergence O 0
of O 0
duplicated O 0
gene O 0
pairs O 0
are O 0
major O 0
contributors O 0
to O 0
genome O 0
evolution. O 0

D1 O 0
and O 0
D2 O 0
are O 0
two O 0
unlinked, O 0
paralogous O 0
nuclear O 0
genes, O 0
whose O 0
double-recessive O 0
mutant O 0
(d1d1d2d2) O 0
results O 0
in O 0
chlorophyll O 0
retention, O 0
called O 0
'stay-green'. O 0

Through O 0
molecular O 0
cloning O 0
and O 0
functional O 0
analyses, O 0
we O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
D1 O 0
and O 0
D2 O 0
are O 0
homologs O 0
of O 0
the O 0
STAY-GREEN O 0
(SGR) O 0
genes O 0
from O 0
other O 0
plant O 0
species O 0
and O 0
were O 0
duplicated O 0
as O 0
a O 0
result O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
recent O 0
WGD O 0

soybean. O 0

Transcriptional O 0
analysis O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
both O 0
D1 O 0
and O 0
D2 O 0
were O 0
more O 0
highly O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
older O 0
tissues, O 0
and O 0
chlorophyll O 0
degradation O 0
and O 0
programmed O 0
cell O 0
death-related O 0
genes O 0
were O 0
suppressed O 0
in O 0
a O 0
d1d2 O 0
double O 0
mutant, O 0
this O 0
situation O 0
indicated O 0
that O 0
these O 0
genes O 0
are O 0
probably O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
the O 0
early O 0
stages O 0
of O 0
tissue O 0
senescence. O 0

Investigation O 0
of O 0
genes O 0
that O 0
flank O 0
D1 O 0
and O 0
D2 O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
evolution O 0
within O 0
collinear O 0
duplicated O 0
blocks O 0
may O 0
affect O 0
the O 0
conservation O 0
of O 0
individual O 0
gene O 0
pairs O 0
within O 0
the O 0
blocks. O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
a O 0
long O 0
terminal O 0
repeat O 0
retrotransposon, O 0
GmD2IN, O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
the O 0
d2 O 0
mutation. O 0

Further O 0
analysis O 0
of O 0
this O 0
retrotransposon O 0
family O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
insertion O 0
in O 0
or O 0
near O 0
the O 0
coding O 0
regions O 0
can O 0
affect O 0
gene O 0
expression O 0
or O 0
splicing O 0
patterns, O 0
and O 0
may O 0
be O 0
an O 0
important O 0
force O 0
to O 0
promote O 0
the O 0
divergence O 0
of O 0
duplicated O 0
gene O 0

orthologs, O 0
belonging O 0
to O 0
the O 0

in O 0
the O 0

at O 0
least O 0
three O 0
rounds O 0
of O 0
whole O 0

duplications O 0
(WGDs), O 0
which O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
multiple O 0
copies O 0
of O 0
about O 0
75% O 0

Subsequent O 0
subfunctionalization O 0

the O 0
main O 0
fate O 0
for O 0
paralogous O 0
gene O 0
pairs O 0
during O 0
the O 0

process. O 0

The O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
CO O 0
orthologs O 0
were O 0
widespread O 0
in O 0
the O 0

while O 0
FT O 0

Twenty-eight O 0

and O 0
twenty-four O 0
FT O 0

were O 0
gained O 0
in O 0
the O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
the O 0
collinear O 0
relationship, O 0
the O 0
soybean O 0
ancestral O 0
CO O 0
ortholog O 0
experienced O 0
three O 0
WGD O 0
events, O 0
but O 0
only O 0
two O 0
paralogous O 0
gene O 0
pairs O 0
(GmCOL1/2 O 0
and O 0
GmCOL5/13) O 0
survived O 0
in O 0
the O 0
modern O 0
soybean. O 0

The O 0
paralogous O 0
gene O 0
pairs, O 0
GmCOL1/2 O 0
or O 0
GmCOL5/13, O 0
showed O 0
similar O 0
expression O 0
patterns O 0
in O 0
pair O 0
but O 0
different O 0
between O 0
pairs, O 0
indicating O 0
that O 0
they O 0
functionally O 0
diverged. O 0

GmFTL1 O 0
to O 0

were O 0
derived O 0
from O 0
the O 0

prior O 0
to O 0
the O 0

and O 0
after O 0
the O 0
Legume O 0
WGD O 0
event O 0
the O 0
ancestor O 0
diverged O 0
into O 0
two O 0
branches, O 0
GmFTL3/5/7 O 0
and O 0
GmFTL1/2/4/6. O 0

GmFTL7 O 0
were O 0
truncated O 0
in O 0
the O 0
N-terminus O 0
compared O 0
to O 0
other O 0
FT-lineage O 0
genes, O 0
but O 0
ubiquitously O 0
expressed. O 0

Expressions O 0
of O 0
GmFTL1 O 0
to O 0
6 O 0
were O 0
higher O 0
in O 0
leaves O 0
at O 0
the O 0
flowering O 0
stage O 0
than O 0
that O 0
at O 0
the O 0
seedling O 0
stage. O 0

GmFTL3 O 0
was O 0
expressed O 0
at O 0
the O 0
highest O 0
level O 0
in O 0
all O 0
tissues O 0
except O 0
roots O 0
at O 0
the O 0
seedling O 0

and O 0
its O 0
circadian O 0

was O 0
different O 0
from O 0
the O 0
other O 0
five O 0
ones. O 0

The O 0
transcript O 0
of O 0
GmFTL6 O 0
was O 0
highly O 0
accumulated O 0
in O 0
seedling O 0
roots. O 0

The O 0
circadian O 0
rhythms O 0
of O 0
GmCOL5/13 O 0
and O 0
GmFT1/2/4/5/6 O 0
were O 0
synchronized O 0
in O 0
a O 0
day, O 0
demonstrating O 0
the O 0
complicate O 0
relationship O 0
of O 0
CO-FT O 0
regulons O 0
in O 0
soybean O 0
leaves. O 0

Over-expression O 0
of O 0
GmCOL2 O 0
did O 0
not O 0
rescue O 0
the O 0
flowering O 0

of O 0
the O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
co O 0

However, O 0
ectopic O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
GmCOL5 O 0
did O 0
rescue O 0
the O 0
co O 0

phenotype. O 0

All O 0
GmFTL1 O 0
to O 0
6 O 0
showed O 0
flower-promoting O 0

After O 0
three O 0
recent O 0

of O 0

in O 0
the O 0
soybean, O 0
the O 0
paralogous O 0
genes O 0
of O 0
CO-FT O 0
regulons O 0
showed O 0
subfunctionalization O 0
through O 0

Then, O 0
only O 0
GmCOL5/13 O 0
kept O 0
flowering-promoting O 0
activities, O 0
while O 0
GmFTL1 O 0
to O 0

contributed O 0
to O 0

Additionally, O 0
GmCOL5/13 O 0
and O 0
GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 O 0
showed O 0
similar O 0
circadian O 0

Therefore, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
suggested O 0
that O 0
GmCOL5/13 O 0
and O 0
GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 O 0
formed O 0
the O 0

The O 0

In O 0

the O 0

Our O 0

Together, O 0
these O 0

we O 0

Although O 0
the O 0

was O 0
expressed O 0
at O 0
only O 0
very O 0
low O 0

in O 0
older O 0
seed O 0
coats O 0
of O 0
the O 0

upregulated O 0

(ANS2, O 0

Surprisingly, O 0
the O 0

also O 0
carried O 0
the O 0

in O 0

Using O 0
RNA-Seq, O 0
we O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
intron O 0
splicing O 0
was O 0
accurate, O 0
albeit O 0
at O 0
lower O 0
levels, O 0
despite O 0
the O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
the O 0

element. O 0

As O 0
determined O 0
by O 0
whole O 0

we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
the O 0
TgmR* O 0
sequence O 0
was O 0
relatively O 0
more O 0
methylated O 0
in O 0
RM30-R* O 0
than O 0
in O 0
the O 0
mutable O 0

line. O 0

The O 0
stabilized O 0
and O 0
more O 0
methylated O 0
RM30-R* O 0
revertant O 0
line O 0
apparently O 0
lacks O 0
effective O 0
binding O 0
of O 0
a O 0
transposae O 0
to O 0
its O 0
subterminal O 0
repeats, O 0
thus O 0
allowing O 0
intron O 0
splicing O 0
to O 0
proceed O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0
sufficient O 0

protein O 0
to O 0
stimulate O 0
anthocyanin O 0
production O 0
and O 0
thus O 0
black O 0

In O 0
this O 0
regard, O 0
the O 0
TgmR* O 0
element O 0
in O 0
soybean O 0
resembles O 0
McClintock's O 0

Although O 0

Recently, O 0
a O 0

for O 0
miR172 O 0
in O 0
soybean O 0
(Glycine O 0

has O 0
been O 0
described; O 0
however, O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
mechanism O 0
through O 0
which O 0
miR172 O 0
acts O 0
to O 0
regulate O 0
nodulation O 0
has O 0
yet O 0
to O 0
be O 0
explored. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
soybean O 0
miR172c O 0
modulates O 0
both O 0
rhizobium O 0
infection O 0
and O 0
nodule O 0

miR172c O 0
was O 0

either O 0

Bradyrhizobium O 0

Reduced O 0

miR172c O 0
caused O 0
dramatic O 0
changes O 0
in O 0
nodule O 0

and O 0
nodule O 0
number. O 0

We O 0
show O 0
that O 0
soybean O 0
miR172c O 0
regulates O 0
nodule O 0
formation O 0
by O 0
repressing O 0
its O 0
target O 0
gene, O 0
Nodule O 0

Control1, O 0
which O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0

that O 0
directly O 0
targets O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
of O 0
the O 0
early O 0
nodulin O 0
gene, O 0
ENOD40. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
transcriptional O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
miR172c O 0
were O 0
regulated O 0
by O 0
both O 0
Nod O 0

Receptor1α/5α-mediated O 0
activation O 0
and O 0
by O 0

Thus, O 0
we O 0
established O 0

Understanding O 0
the O 0

In O 0

a O 0

genetic O 0
variation O 0
at O 0
four O 0

plays O 0
an O 0
important O 0
role O 0
in O 0
adaptation O 0
to O 0

with O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

of O 0
natural O 0
variation O 0
in O 0
time O 0
to O 0
flowering O 0

Using O 0
a O 0
cross O 0
between O 0
early-maturing O 0
soybean O 0
cultivars, O 0
we O 0
performed O 0
a O 0
genetic O 0
and O 0
molecular O 0
study O 0
of O 0
flowering O 0

The O 0

this O 0

segregated O 0
for O 0
two O 0

The O 0
latter O 0

was O 0
subjected O 0
to O 0
detailed O 0
molecular O 0
analysis O 0
to O 0
identify O 0
the O 0
responsible O 0
gene. O 0

Fine O 0
mapping, O 0
sequencing, O 0
and O 0
expression O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0

Regardless O 0
of O 0
daylength O 0

the O 0

transcribed O 0
at O 0
a O 0
very O 0
low O 0
level O 0
in O 0
comparison O 0
with O 0
the O 0
E9 O 0

and O 0
delayed O 0
flowering. O 0

Despite O 0
identical O 0

sequences, O 0
a O 0
number O 0
of O 0
single O 0
nucleotide O 0
polymorphisms O 0
and O 0

were O 0
detected O 0
in O 0
the O 0
promoter, O 0
untranslated O 0
regions, O 0
and O 0
introns O 0
between O 0
the O 0
two O 0
cultivars. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
the O 0
e9 O 0
allele O 0
had O 0
a O 0
Ty1/copia-like O 0
retrotransposon, O 0
SORE-1, O 0
inserted O 0
in O 0
the O 0

Comparison O 0

of O 0
different O 0

among O 0
near-isogenic O 0

attenuated O 0

SORE-1 O 0
was O 0
highly O 0
methylated, O 0
and O 0
did O 0
not O 0
appear O 0
to O 0
disrupt O 0

processing. O 0

The O 0
soybean O 0
maturity O 0
gene O 0
E9 O 0
is O 0
FT2a, O 0
and O 0
its O 0
recessive O 0
allele O 0
delays O 0
flowering O 0
because O 0
of O 0
lower O 0
transcript O 0
abundance O 0
that O 0
is O 0
caused O 0
by O 0
allele-specific O 0
transcriptional O 0
repression O 0
due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
insertion O 0
of O 0
SORE-1. O 0

The O 0

thus O 0
directly O 0

such O 0

in O 0
controlling O 0

Soybean O 0
flowering O 0

are O 0
strictly O 0

by O 0

Photoperiod-sensitive O 0

when O 0
switched O 0
from O 0
short-day O 0

suggesting O 0
the O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
a O 0
'floral-inhibitor' O 0
under O 0

We O 0
combined O 0
gene O 0

profiling O 0
with O 0
a O 0

is O 0
a O 0

GmFT1a O 0

similar O 0
to O 0
the O 0

GmFT2a/5a. O 0

However, O 0
in O 0

was O 0
induced O 0
by O 0

This O 0
was O 0
unexpected, O 0
as O 0
it O 0
is O 0
the O 0
complete O 0
opposite O 0
of O 0
the O 0

GmFT2a/5a. O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0
key O 0

may O 0
up-regulate O 0
GmFT1a O 0

It O 0
is O 0
also O 0
notable O 0
that O 0
GmFT1a O 0

was O 0
conspicuously O 0
high O 0
in O 0
late-flowering O 0

Transgenic O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
GmFT1a O 0
delayed O 0
flowering O 0

in O 0

confirming O 0
that O 0
GmFT1a O 0
functions O 0
as O 0
a O 0

This O 0

highlights O 0
the O 0

in O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
conducted O 0

qRslx3 O 0
exhibited O 0
the O 0

Furthermore, O 0
qRslx3 O 0

used, O 0
along O 0
with O 0
previously O 0

These O 0

Many O 0

with O 0
a O 0

. O 0

Nevertheless, O 0
a O 0

is O 0
desirable O 0
for O 0

The O 0

that O 0
naturally O 0
occurred O 0
in O 0
the O 0

during O 0
soybean O 0

Interestingly, O 0
this O 0
mutation O 0
not O 0
only O 0
'shined' O 0
the O 0

but O 0
also O 0
elevated O 0

Such O 0
an O 0
elevation O 0
of O 0

We O 0

These O 0

they O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
139 O 0

these O 0

were O 0
divided O 0
into O 0
six O 0

their O 0

Quantitative O 0

that O 0
GmMYB118 O 0
highly O 0

thus, O 0
this O 0

was O 0
selected O 0
for O 0
further O 0

Subcellular O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

Ectopic O 0

GmMYB118 O 0
increased O 0

the O 0

Furthermore, O 0

the O 0

The O 0

in O 0
the O 0

were O 0

These O 0

In O 0

two O 0

have O 0
been O 0
reported O 0
in O 0
the O 0
Medicago O 0

to O 0
regulate O 0

Both O 0

In O 0
this O 0

These O 0
analyses O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
this O 0
pathway O 0
acts O 0
systemically O 0
from O 0
shoots O 0
to O 0
positively O 0

In O 0

we O 0

Finally, O 0
we O 0
showed O 0
that O 0

Overall, O 0
these O 0

qVGH-18-2, O 0
Glyma18g06870 O 0
was O 0
identified O 0
as O 0
the O 0

Hence, O 0

The O 0

play O 0
a O 0
central O 0
role O 0
in O 0

processes, O 0
as O 0

However, O 0
no O 0
comprehensive O 0
study O 0
of O 0
the O 0
BES1 O 0
gene O 0
family O 0
in O 0
soybean O 0
has O 0
been O 0
reported. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
work, O 0
16 O 0
GmBES1-like O 0
genes O 0
were O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
soybean, O 0
which O 0
could O 0
be O 0
divided O 0
into O 0
two O 0
clades O 0
based O 0
on O 0
their O 0
phylogenetic O 0
relationships, O 0
gene O 0
structures O 0
and O 0
motif O 0
compositions. O 0

We O 0
then O 0
examined O 0
their O 0
duplication O 0
status O 0
and O 0
evolutionary O 0
models. O 0

The O 0
result O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
most O 0
of O 0
the O 0
GmBES1-like O 0
genes O 0
have O 0
duplicated O 0
counterparts O 0
generated O 0
from O 0
the O 0
recent O 0
Glycine O 0
WGD O 0
event, O 0
and O 0
these O 0
genes O 0
are O 0
originated O 0
from O 0
6 O 0
distinct O 0
ancestors O 0
before O 0
the O 0
Gamma O 0
WGT O 0
event. O 0

We O 0
further O 0
studied O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
profiles O 0
of O 0
GmBES1-like O 0
genes, O 0
and O 0
found O 0
their O 0
spatio-temporal O 0
and O 0
stressed O 0
expression O 0
patterns O 0
varied O 0
tremendously. O 0

For O 0
example, O 0
GmBES1-5 O 0
and O 0
GmBES1-6 O 0
were O 0
highly O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
almost O 0
every O 0
sample, O 0
whereas O 0
GmBES1-7 O 0
and O 0
GmBES1-8 O 0
were O 0
not O 0
expressed. O 0

Additionally, O 0
interaction O 0
network O 0
analysis O 0
revealed O 0
the O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
3 O 0
clusters O 0
between O 0
GmBES1-like O 0
genes O 0
and O 0
other O 0
associated O 0
genes, O 0
implying O 0
that O 0
they O 0
have O 0
both O 0
the O 0
conserved O 0
and O 0
divergent O 0
functions. O 0

Lastly, O 0
we O 0
analyzed O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0
diversity O 0
of O 0
GmBES1-like O 0
genes O 0
in O 0
302 O 0
resequenced O 0
wild, O 0
landrace O 0
and O 0
improved O 0
soybean O 0
accessions. O 0

It O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
most O 0
of O 0
these O 0
genes O 0
are O 0
well O 0
conserved, O 0
and O 0
they O 0
are O 0
not O 0
changed O 0
during O 0
domestication O 0
and O 0
improvement. O 0

These O 0
results O 0
provide O 0
insights O 0
into O 0
the O 0
characterization O 0
of O 0
GmBES1 O 0
family O 0
and O 0
lay O 0
the O 0
foundation O 0
for O 0
further O 0
functional O 0
study O 0
of O 0
such O 0
genes. O 0

However, O 0
its O 0

ranged O 0
from O 0
7.30 O 0
to O 0
23.16% O 0
under O 0
both O 0

All O 0
these O 0
QTLs O 0
were O 0
novel, O 0
and O 0
21 O 0
of O 0
these O 0
QTLs O 0
were O 0
clustered O 0
in O 0
five O 0

on O 0
four O 0

viz., O 0

among O 0
them O 0
the O 0
highest O 0
concentration O 0
of O 0
seven O 0

were O 0
found O 0
in O 0

Furthermore, O 0
QTLs O 0
within O 0
all O 0
the O 0

are O 0
linked O 0
to O 0
at O 0

two O 0

which O 0
is O 0
also O 0
supported O 0
by O 0
highly O 0

QTLs O 0
for O 0

in O 0
"QTL O 0

were O 0
found O 0
in O 0
both O 0

and O 0
also O 0
QTLs O 0
underlying O 0

are O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
both O 0
RIL O 0

These O 0
are O 0
the O 0

governing O 0
the O 0

This O 0

The O 0
newly O 0

QTLs O 0
provides O 0
valuable O 0

Hence, O 0
the O 0

for O 0
expanding O 0
the O 0

Flowering O 0
time O 0
is O 0
a O 0
key O 0
agronomic O 0
trait O 0
that O 0
directly O 0
influences O 0
the O 0
successful O 0

of O 0
soybean O 0
(Glycine O 0

to O 0
diverse O 0
latitudes O 0

GmFT2a O 0
and O 0
GmFT5a O 0
have O 0
been O 0
extensively O 0
identified O 0
as O 0
flowering O 0
activators O 0
and O 0
integrators O 0
in O 0
soybean. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
two O 0
quantitative O 0

loci O 0
(QTLs) O 0
regions O 0
harbouring O 0
GmFT2a O 0
and O 0
GmFT5a, O 0
respectively, O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
different O 0
genetic O 0
effects O 0
on O 0
flowering O 0
under O 0
different O 0
photoperiods. O 0

We O 0
analysed O 0
the O 0
flowering O 0

of O 0
transgenic O 0
plants O 0
overexpressing O 0
GmFT2a O 0
or O 0
GmFT5a, O 0
ft2a O 0

and O 0
ft2aft5a O 0
double O 0
mutants O 0
under O 0
long-day O 0
(LD) O 0
and O 0
short-day O 0
(SD) O 0
conditions. O 0

We O 0
confirmed O 0
that O 0
GmFT2a O 0
and O 0
GmFT5a O 0
are O 0
not O 0
redundant, O 0
they O 0
collectively O 0
regulate O 0
flowering O 0
time, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
GmFT2a O 0
is O 0
more O 0
prominent O 0
than O 0
that O 0
of O 0
GmFT5a O 0
under O 0
SD O 0
conditions O 0
whereas O 0
GmFT5a O 0
has O 0
more O 0
significant O 0
effects O 0
than O 0
GmFT2a O 0
under O 0
LD O 0
conditions. O 0

GmFT5a, O 0
not O 0
GmFT2a, O 0
was O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
soybean O 0
to O 0
adapt O 0
to O 0
high O 0

regions. O 0

The O 0
ft2aft5a O 0
double O 0
mutants O 0
showed O 0
late O 0
flowering O 0
by O 0
about O 0
31.3 O 0
days O 0
under O 0
SD O 0
conditions O 0
and O 0
produced O 0
significantly O 0
increased O 0
numbers O 0
of O 0
pods O 0
and O 0
seeds O 0
per O 0
plant O 0
compared O 0
to O 0
the O 0
wild O 0
type. O 0

We O 0
speculate O 0
that O 0
these O 0
mutants O 0
may O 0
have O 0
enormous O 0
yield O 0
potential O 0
for O 0
the O 0
tropics. O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
we O 0
examined O 0
the O 0

these O 0

An O 0

To O 0

the O 0

The O 0

however, O 0
α-tocopherol O 0

Therefore, O 0
it O 0

necessary O 0
to O 0
optimize O 0
the O 0

the O 0

A O 0

that O 0
of O 0

In O 0

provides O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
basis O 0
of O 0
circadian O 0
clock O 0
in O 0
soybean O 0
is O 0
not O 0
known. O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
used O 0
soybean O 0

to O 0
monitor O 0

and O 0
the O 0

We O 0
discovered O 0
in O 0
experiments O 0
with O 0
constant O 0
light O 0

conditions O 0
that O 0
the O 0

of O 0
about O 0
24-h O 0
in O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
circadian O 0
clock O 0
is O 0
entrainable O 0
by O 0
ambient O 0
light/dark O 0
or O 0

Specifically, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
light O 0

cold O 0
temperature O 0
pulses O 0
can O 0
induce O 0
phase O 0
shifts O 0
of O 0
circadian O 0

and O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0
magnitude O 0
and O 0
direction O 0
of O 0
phase O 0

depends O 0
on O 0
the O 0

We O 0
obtained O 0

GmLCLa1, O 0
LCLa2, O 0
LCLb1, O 0
and O 0
LCLb2 O 0
using O 0
CRISPR, O 0
and O 0
found O 0
that O 0
loss-of-function O 0
of O 0
these O 0
four O 0
GmLCL O 0

leads O 0
to O 0
an O 0

Our O 0

establishes O 0
that O 0
the O 0
morning-phased O 0
GmLCLs O 0
genes O 0
act O 0
constitutively O 0
to O 0
maintain O 0
circadian O 0

demonstrates O 0
that O 0
their O 0

Once O 0
confirmed, O 0
we O 0
performed O 0
stable O 0

and O 0
obtained O 0
19 O 0

Subsequently, O 0
we O 0
obtained O 0
one O 0

The O 0

of O 0
the O 0

transgene-free O 0
quadruple O 0

were O 0
observed, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
results O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

of O 0
GmLHY O 0
displayed O 0
reduced O 0

in O 0
the O 0

the O 0

could O 0
be O 0

were O 0
significantly O 0
decreased O 0

These O 0

suggest O 0
that O 0
GmLHY O 0

an O 0

that O 0

We O 0
also O 0
developed O 0

Our O 0

indicate O 0
that O 0
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated O 0
targeted O 0

Although O 0
additional O 0

the O 0

the O 0

remain O 0

A O 0
comparative O 0
proteomic O 0

was O 0
conducted O 0
between O 0
two O 0
low O 0

had O 0
a O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

showed O 0
a O 0

There O 0
were O 0
282 O 0

(DAPs) O 0
identified O 0

Among O 0
these O 0
DAPs, O 0
80 O 0
were O 0
down-accumulated O 0
and O 0
202 O 0
were O 0
up-accumulated. O 0

Bioinformatic O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

KEGG O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
these O 0

were O 0
mainly O 0
involved O 0
in O 0

process O 0
in O 0

The O 0
TW-1-M O 0
and O 0

showed O 0
many O 0

The O 0

The O 0

The O 0

a O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

these O 0

are O 0
not O 0
clearly. O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
one O 0
such O 0

GmFT2b, O 0
promotes O 0
flowering O 0
under O 0
long-days O 0

Overexpression O 0

flowering-related O 0
genes O 0
which O 0
are O 0

We O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0
examine O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0

The O 0

Interestingly, O 0

We O 0

GmVTL1a/b, O 0

the O 0

that O 0

Taken O 0

Further O 0

showed O 0
that O 0

At O 0

overexpression O 0

Mechanisms O 0

Legumes, O 0

can O 0
form O 0
symbiotic O 0

to O 0
secure O 0
nitrogen O 0
for O 0
growth. O 0

The O 0
formation O 0
of O 0
nitrogen-fixing O 0
nodules O 0
on O 0

requires O 0
the O 0

The O 0
nodules O 0
house O 0
the O 0
nitrogen-fixing O 0
rhizobia O 0
in O 0
organelle-like O 0
structures O 0
known O 0
as O 0
symbiosomes, O 0
which O 0
enable O 0

facilitate O 0
the O 0
exchange O 0

In O 0
addition O 0

this O 0
beneficial O 0
interaction, O 0
legumes O 0
are O 0
continuously O 0
exposed O 0

would-be O 0
pathogenic O 0
microbes; O 0
therefore O 0
the O 0
ability O 0
to O 0
discriminate O 0
pathogens O 0
from O 0
symbionts O 0
is O 0
a O 0
major O 0
determinant O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

Recently, O 0
a O 0

As O 0
a O 0

101 O 0
QTLs O 0
were O 0
detected O 0
by O 0
the O 0

57 O 0
QTLs O 0

13 O 0
QEIs O 0
were O 0
detected O 0
by O 0
3VmrMLM O 0
in O 0
multi-environment O 0

Among O 0
these O 0
QTLs, O 0
some O 0
QTLs O 0
(Group O 0

were O 0
repeatedly O 0
detected O 0
three O 0

some O 0
QTLs O 0
(Group O 0

were O 0
repeatedly O 0
detected O 0
only O 0
by O 0
3VmrMLM. O 0

In O 0
the O 0
two O 0

was O 0
able O 0
to O 0
correctly O 0

were O 0
detected O 0
in O 0
Group O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
comparative O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
proportion O 0

was O 0
higher, O 0
in O 0

these O 0
QEIs O 0

Finally, O 0
around O 0
the O 0
8 O 0

validated O 0
by O 0
RNA-Seq O 0

In O 0
summary, O 0
we O 0
used O 0
phenotypic O 0
data O 0
of O 0

tested O 0
the O 0

It O 0
is O 0

In O 0
this O 0

The O 0

for O 0
the O 0
Pdh1 O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
244 O 0

showed O 0
heterozygosity. O 0

To O 0
identify O 0
additional O 0
quantitative O 0

we O 0
applied O 0
an O 0

suggested O 0
that O 0

Pdh1, O 0
two O 0
minor O 0
QTLs O 0
were O 0
identified O 0
on O 0

Both O 0
minor O 0
QTLs O 0
for O 0

were O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
calmodulin-binding O 0

which O 0
presumably O 0
plays O 0
an O 0
important O 0
role O 0
in O 0
regulating O 0
PD O 0
in O 0

Thus, O 0
the O 0
current O 0

provided O 0
additional O 0
