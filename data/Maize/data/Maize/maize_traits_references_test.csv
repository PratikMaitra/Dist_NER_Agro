10323240,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,"High-resolution mapping of loci conferring resistance to sugarcane mosaic virus in maize using RFLP, SSR, and AFLP markers","Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is one of the most important virus diseases of maize in Europe. Genetic analysis on backcross five (BC5) progeny derived from the cross FAP1360A (resistant) x F7 (susceptible) confirmed that at least two dominant genes, Scm1 and Scm2, are required for resistance to SCMV in the progeny of this cross. With the aid of RFLP and SSR marker analyses, Scm1 was mapped in the region of 8.7 cM between the nucleolus organizer region (nor) and RFLP marker bnl6.29 on the short arm of chromosome 6, while Scm2 was mapped to an interval of 26.8 cM flanked by the RFLP markers umc92 and umc102 near the centromere region of chromosome 3. Both chromosome regions were further enriched for AFLP markers by successful application of a bulked segregant analysis to this oligogenic trait. A total of 23 linked AFLP markers were identified, clustered in chromosome regions adjacent to either Scm1 or Scm2. Seven AFLP markers linked to Scm1 resided within the nor-bnl6.29 interval, and one of them, E3M8-1, showed no recombination with Scm1. Three AFLP markers linked to Scm2 are located between umc92 and umc102."
10332606,root development,"Digging out roots: Pattern formation, cell division, and morphogenesis in plants","The analysis of plant development by genetic, molecular, and surgical approaches has accumulated a large body of data, and yet it remains a challenge to uncover the basic mechanisms that are operating. Early steps of development, when the zygote and its daughter cells organize the embryonic plant, are poorly understood despite considerable efforts toward the identification of relevant genes. Reported cases of genetic redundancy suggest that the difficulty in uncovering patterning genes may reflect overlapping gene activities. Our current knowledge on plant embryo development still leaves open whether mechanisms for axis formation and subsequent pattern formation are fundamentally different in animals and plants. Axis formation may follow the general principle of establishing a peripheral asymmetric cue and mobilizing the cytoskeleton toward this cue--in the case of plants possibly located in the cell wall--but the molecules involved may be entirely different. Embryonic pattern formation involves the establishment of different domains, but although there are candidates, it is not clear whether genes that define these domains are identified yet. Pattern formation continues postembryonically in the meristem, and the flexibility of this process may be explained by a feed-forward system of patterning cues originating from more mature cells. Control of cell division and differentiation, which is important in the meristems--regions of continuous development--has been studied intensively and appears to involve short-range signaling and transmembrane receptor kinase activation. Finally, although high importance of control of cell division rates and planes for plant morphogenesis have been often inferred, recent genetic studies as well as comparative morphological data point to a less decisive role of cell division and to global controls of as yet unknown nature."
10355122,cytoplasmic male sterility; cms,Mitochondrial transcript processing and restoration of male fertility in T-cytoplasm maize,"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) systems have been useful in the production of hybrid seed in a number of crops. The Texas or T-cytoplasmic male-sterile (cms-T) system was used extensively in the 1960s to eliminate the need for hand detasseling in hybrid maize production. As a consequence of the 1970 epidemic of southern corn leaf blight, cms-T is no longer widely used commercially. However, it has been developed as a model system to study the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility and fertility restoration. Male sterility in T-cytoplasm maize results from the action of a T-cytoplasm-specific mitochondrial gene, T-urf13. Full (or partial) fertility restoration of T-cytoplasm maize is mediated by the Rf2 nuclear restorer in combination with one of three other restorers: Rf1, Rf8, or Rf*. Rf2 encodes a protein highly similar to mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases; Rf1, Rf8, and Rf* each mediate discrete T-urf13 mitochondrial transcript processing events. To test the functionality of Rf1, Rf8, or Rf*, a T-cytoplasm transformation system is under development. AFLP bulk-segregant analysis has been used to identify DNA markers closely linked to the Rf8 locus. These tools will provide a foundation for determining mechanisms of nuclear-directed mitochondrial RNA processing and fertility restoration."
10444094,cell wall carbohydrate content,"The mechanism of synthesis of a mixed-linkage (1 ->3),(1 ->4)beta-D-glucan in maize. Evidence for multiple sites of glucosyl transfer in the synthase complex","We examined the mechanism of synthesis in vitro of (1-->3), (1-->4)beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan), a growth-specific cell wall polysaccharide found in grasses and cereals. beta-Glucan is composed primarily of cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units linked by single (1-->3)beta-linkages. The ratio of cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units in the native polymer is strictly controlled at between 2 and 3 in all grasses, whereas the ratios of these units in beta-glucan formed in vitro vary from 1.5 with 5 &mgr;M UDP-glucose (Glc) to over 11 with 30 mM substrate. These results support a model in which three sites of glycosyl transfer occur within the synthase complex to produce the cellobiosyl-(1-->3)-D-glucosyl units. We propose that failure to fill one of the sites results in the iterative addition of one or more cellobiosyl units to produce the longer cellodextrin units in the polymer. Variations in the UDP-Glc concentration in excised maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles did not result in wide variations in the ratios of cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units in beta-glucan synthesized in vivo, indicating that other factors control delivery of UDP-Glc to the synthase. In maize sucrose synthase is enriched in Golgi membranes and plasma membranes and may be involved in the control of substrate delivery to beta-glucan synthase and cellulose synthase."
10468640,sucrose synthase activity,Sugars modulate an unusual mode of control of the cell-wall invertase gene (Incw1) through its 3 ' untranslated region in a cell suspension culture of maize,"We show here that a cell-wall invertase encoded by the Incw1 gene is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by sugars in a heterotrophic cell suspension culture of maize. The Incw1 gene encoded two transcripts: Incw1-S (small) and Incw1-L (large); the size variation was attributable to different lengths in the 3' untranslated region. Both metabolizable and nonmetabolizable sugars induced Incw1-L RNA apparently by default. However, only the metabolizable sugars, sucrose and D-glucose, were associated with the increased steady-state abundance of Incw1-S RNA, the concomitant increased levels of INCW1 protein and enzyme activity, and the downstream metabolic repression of the sucrose synthase gene, Sh1. Conversely, nonmetabolizable sugars, including the two glucose analogs 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose, induced greater steady-state levels of the Incw1-L RNA, but this increase did not lead to either an increase in the levels of the INCW1 protein/enzyme activity or the repression of the Sh1 gene. We conclude that sugar sensing and the induction of the Incw1 gene is independent of the hexokinase pathway. More importantly, our results also suggest that the 3' untranslated region of the Incw1 gene acts as a regulatory sensor of carbon starvation and may constitute a link between sink metabolism and cellular translation in plants."
10469205,Flowering,Time to flowering in brown midrib mutants of maize: an alternative approach to the analysis of developmental traits,"The brown midrib (bm) mutations of maize affect the biosynthesis of lignin, resulting in reddish-brown vascular tissue in the stem, the leaf blade and sheath. Investigating the effects of the change in lignin content and composition on other phenotypic traits in bm mutants is important in increasing the understanding of how secondary metabolism affects plant development. We examined the time to flowering of inbred A619 and near-isogenic lines of bm2, bm1-bm2 and a segregating population with wild-type and bm1 heterozygotes in a controlled experimental design (Latin square) in two locations. Survival analysis was used to describe the distribution of the time to flowering and compare differences between genotypic classes. Survival analysis is a readily accessible technique that can improve inferences in cases where distributions are skewed, or where data are missing or incomplete. The basic approach to survival analysis as well as its specific application to these data is described. After controlling for the effects of the locations, the time to flowering of the bm2 and segregating populations was found to be significantly different from the wild-type and bm1-bm2 populations."
10482657,invertase activity,Starch and the control of kernel number in maize at low water potentials,"After reproduction is initiated in plants, subsequent reproductive development is sometimes interrupted, which decreases the final number of seeds and fruits. We subjected maize (Zea mays L.) to low water potentials (psi(w)) that frequently cause this kind of failure. We observed metabolite pools and enzyme activities in the developing ovaries while we manipulated the sugar stream by feeding sucrose (Suc) to the stems. Low psi(w) imposed for 5 d around pollination allowed embryos to form, but abortion occurred and kernel number decreased markedly. The ovary contained starch that nearly disappeared during this abortion. Analyses showed that all of the intermediates in starch synthesis were depleted. However, when labeled Suc was fed to the stems, label arrived at the ovaries. Solute accumulated and caused osmotic adjustment. Suc accumulated, but other intermediates did not, showing that a partial block in starch synthesis occurred at the first step in Suc utilization. This step was mediated by invertase, which had low activity. Because of the block, Suc feeding only partially prevented starch disappearance and abortion. These results indicate that young embryos abort when the sugar stream is interrupted sufficiently to deplete starch during early ovary development, and this abortion results in a loss of mature seeds and fruits. At low psi(w), maintaining the sugar stream partially prevented the abortion, but invertase regulated the synthesis of ovary starch and partially prevented full recovery."
10511573,maturity date - harvest; anthesis date; plant height; shoot development; node number,Fine mapping and characterization of linked quantitative trait loci involved in the transition of the maize apical meristem from vegetative to generative structures,"Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has detected two linked QTL in the 8L chromosome arm segment introgressed from Gaspe Flint (a Northern Flint open-pollinated population) into the background of N28 (a Corn Belt Dent inbred line). Homozygous recombinant lines, with a variable length of the introgressed segment, confirmed the presence of the two previously identified, linked QTL. In the N28 background, Gaspe Flint QTL alleles at both loci induce a reduction in node number, height, and days to anthesis (pollen shed). Given the determinate growth pattern of maize, the phenotypic effects indicate that the two QTL are involved in the transition of the apical meristem from vegetative to generative structures. Relative to the effects of the two QTL in the background of N28, we distinguish two general developmental factors affecting the timing of pollen shed. The primary factor is the timing of the transition of the apical meristem. The second, derivative factor is the global extent of internode elongation. Having separated the two linked QTL, we have laid the foundation for the positional cloning of the QTL with a larger effect."
10585502,lysine content; seed quality,Conformation and stability of barley chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 (CI-2) mutants containing multiple lysine substitutions,"A major goal of agricultural biotechnology is to increase the nutritional value of maize seed through the expression of heterologous proteins enriched in lysine. One promising candidate is barley chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 (CI-2), a plant protein that has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. Based on the tertiary structure of wild-type (WT) CI-2, five mutants with lysine contents ranging from 20 to 25 mol percent were designed, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography. Inasmuch as previous transgenic experiments suggested that proper folding and stability may be essential for in vivo accumulation of the engineered proteins in plant cells, we first undertook an in vitro study of the conformation and thermodynamic stability of the CI-2 mutants in order to select an ideal candidate for plant expression. Mutant and WT CI-2 proteins had similar circular dichroism spectra, suggesting similar secondary structures. However, differences in the accessibility of the sole tryptophan residue, Trp24, indicated that the local conformation differed among the mutants. The thermodynamic stability of the mutants ranged from <2 to 4.9 kcal/mol compared with approximately 7 kcal/mol for the wild-type protein. In conjunction with proteolytic stability studies, we have identified one mutant that has the potential to be expressed in a stable manner in plant cells."
10592039,biomass yield,Photosynthetic acclimation of maize to growth under elevated levels of carbon dioxide,"The effects of elevated CO(2) concentrations on the photochemistry, biochemistry and physiology of C(4) photosynthesis were studied in maize (Zea mays L.). Plants were grown at ambient (350 &mgr;L L(-1)) or ca. 3 times ambient (1100 &mgr;L L(-1)) CO(2) levels under high light conditions in a greenhouse for 30 d. Relative to plants grown at ambient CO(2) levels, plants grown under elevated CO(2) accumulated ca. 20% more biomass and 23% more leaf area. When measured at the CO(2) concentration of growth, mature leaves of high-CO(2)-grown plants had higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (ca. 15%), lower stomatal conductance (71%), higher water-use efficiency (225%) and higher dark respiration rates (100%). High-CO(2)-grown plants had lower carboxylation efficiencies (23%), measured under limiting CO(2), and lower leaf protein contents (22%). Activities of a number of C(3) and C(4) cycle enzymes decreased on a leaf-area basis in the high-CO(2)-grown plants by 5-30%, with NADP-malate dehydrogenase exhibiting the greatest decrease. In contrast, activities of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase increased significantly under elevated CO(2) condition (8% and 36%, respectively). These data show that the C(4) plant maize may benefit from elevated CO(2) through acclimation in the capacities of certain photosynthetic enzymes. The increased capacity to synthesize sucrose and starch, and to utilize these end-products of photosynthesis to produce extra energy by respiration, may contribute to the enhanced growth of maize under elevated CO(2)."
10597036,protein synthesis,Cloning and characterization of the chloroplast elongation factor EF-Tu cDNA of Oryza sativa L,"From the rice leaf cDNA library, we have cloned a cDNA encoding rice chloroplast translational elongation factor EF-Tu (tufA). The rice tufA cDNA clone contains 1678 nucleotides and codes for a 467 amino acid protein including a putative chloroplast transit peptide of 59 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular mass of the mature protein is approximately 45 kDa. This cDNA clone contains the 61 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the 213 nucleotides of 3' UTR. Amino acid sequence identity of the rice tufA with the mature chloroplast EF-Tu proteins of tobacco, pea, arabidopsis, and soybean ranges from 83% to 86%. The deduced polypeptide of the rice tufA cDNA contains GTP binding domains in its N-terminal region and chloroplast EF-Tu signature regions in the C-terminal region. The rice tufA appears to exist as a single copy gene, although its homologues of maize and oat exist as multiple copy genes. The rice tufA gene is located in chromosome 1 and is more highly expressed in the leaf than in root tissue."
10608665,response to nitrogen,His-Asp phosphotransfer possibly involved in the nitrogen signal transduction mediated by cytokinin in maize: molecular cloning of cDNAs for two-component regulatory factors and demonstration of phosphotransfer activity in vitro,"Implication of His-to-Asp and/or Asp-to-His (His-Asp) phosphorelay has been recently reported in signal transduction pathways initiated by ethylene and cytokinin. These signaling systems are generally composed of sensor His-protein kinases, His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domains, and response regulator domains. In this study, we isolated maize cDNAs, designated as ZmRR2 and ZmHP2, which encode a response regulator domain and HPt domain, respectively, and we identified their His-to-Asp phosphotransfer activity in vitro. The putative translated product of ZmRR2 was highly similar to that of ZmRR1 (78% identity), a maize response regulator homologue. The putative translated product of ZmHP2 showed similarity to that of HPt domains from Arabidopsis thaliana (AHP1-AHP3: 44 to 47% identity) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ypdlp: 24% identity). In vitro experiments demonstrated that the putative signaling factors can transfer the phosphoryl group from His-80 of ZmHP2 to Asp-90 of ZmRRs. Treating detached leaves with t-zeatin or supplying inorganic nitrogen to the whole plant induced the accumulation of ZmRR1 and ZmRR2 transcripts. On the other hand, the steady-state transcript level of ZmHP2 was not affected by cytokinin or inorganic nitrogen sources. These results indicate that His-Asp phosphotransfer may be involved in the transduction of nitrogen signals mediated by cytokinin, and that multiple response regulators participate in the signaling pathways."
10712559,response to aluminum,Genotypical differences in aluminum resistance of maize are expressed in the distal part of the transition zone. Is reduced basipetal auxin flow involved in inhibition of root elongation by aluminum?,"Short-term Al treatment (90 microM Al at pH 4.5 for 1 h) of the distal transition zone (DTZ; 1-2 mm from the root tip), which does not contribute significantly to root elongation, inhibited root elongation in the main elongation zone (EZ; 2.5-5 mm from the root tip) to the same extent as treatment of the entire maize (Zea mays) root apex. Application of Al to the EZ had no effect on root elongation. Higher genotypical resistance to Al applied to the entire root apex, and specifically to the DTZ, was expressed by less inhibition of root elongation, Al accumulation, and Al-induced callose formation, primarily in the DTZ. A characteristic pH profile along the surface of the root apex with a maximum of pH 5.3 in the DTZ was demonstrated. Al application induced a substantial flattening of the pH profile moreso in the Al-sensitive than in the Al-resistant cultivar. Application of indole-3-acetic acid to the EZ but not to the meristematic zone significantly alleviated the inhibition of root elongation induced by the application of Al to the DTZ. Basipetal transport of exogenously applied [(3)H]indole-3-acetic acid to the meristematic zone was significantly inhibited by Al application to the DTZ in the Al-sensitive maize cv Lixis. Our results provide evidence that the primary mechanisms of genotypical differences in Al resistance are located within the DTZ, and suggest a signaling pathway in the root apex mediating the Al signal between the DTZ and the EZ through basipetal auxin transport."
10725175,furfural concentration; aflatoxin level,Identification and effects of maize silk volatiles on cultures of Aspergillus flavus,"Volatiles generated from corn silks of individual genotypes of maize were found to exhibit differences in biological activities when the volatiles were exposed to 5-day solid cultures of Aspergillus flavus. In inverted potato dextrose-agar Petri plate bioassays, it was found that volatiles emitted from silks of the different maize genotypes had a profound effect on the growth of the fungus and, consequently, aflatoxin production. To determine the underlying cause for this bioactivity, volatiles emitted from the maize silks were trapped on Tenax glass columns and were analyzed by GC-MS. Aflatoxin field-resistant maize genotypes exhibited a larger relative concentration of the antifungal aldehyde, furfural (2-furancarboxaldehyde), when compared to the relative concentrations of the field-susceptible varieties tested. In a closed-container 5-day study, it was observed that fresh 1- and 4-day-old corn silk samples of aflatoxin-resistant maize genotypes emitted higher concentrations of furfural compared to those from susceptible genotypes. This observation probably explains the reason for the bioactivity observed in the in vitro bioassays, and the presence of furfural appears to contribute to a defense mechanism for protecting the developing maize kernel from fungal attack."
10771064,plant growth rate,"Endo-1,3;1,4-beta-glucanase from coleoptiles of rice and maize: role in the regulation of plant growth","The Matrix Polymer Hydrolysis Model for regulation of growth in plants is based on the simultaneous hydrolysis and incorporation of new glucans into the cell wall observed in growing plant tissues. The inhibition of growth in rice coleoptile tissues treated with glucanase antibodies confirms similar results observed previously in maize coleoptiles and provides direct evidence for a role of glucanase in control of plant growth. Analysis of two-maize coleoptile endo-glucanase ESTs shows that these sequences are not related to any other previously known family of glycosyl hydrolase. Thus, the coleoptile endo-glucanase enzyme should be classified as a new enzyme group (E.C. 3.2.1.xx). These discoveries enable new initiatives for further investigation of the glucanase role in control of plant growth."
10805454,insect response,"Demonstration and characterization of (E)-nerolidol synthase from maize: a herbivore-inducible terpene synthase participating in (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene biosynthesis","Upon herbivore attack, maize (Zea mays L.) emits a mixture of volatile compounds that attracts herbivore enemies to the plant. One of the major components of this mixture is an unusual acyclic C11 homoterpene, (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), which is also emitted by many other species following herbivore damage. Biosynthesis of DMNT has been previously shown to proceed via the sesquiterpene alcohol, (E)-nerolidol. Here we demonstrate an enzyme activity that converts farnesyl diphosphate, the universal precursor of sesquiterpenes, to (3S)-(E)-nerolidol in cell-free extracts of maize leaves that had been fed upon by Spodoptera littoralis. The properties of this (E)-nerolidol synthase resemble those of other terpene synthases. Evidence for its participation in DMNT biosynthesis includes the direct incorporation of deuterium-labeled (E)-nerolidol into DMNT and the close correlation between increases in (E)-nerolidol synthase activity and DMNT emission after herbivore damage. Since farnesyl diphosphate has many other metabolic fates, (E)-nerolidol synthase may represent the first committed step of DMNT biosynthesis in maize. However, the formation of this unusual acyclic terpenoid appears to be regulated at both the level of (E)-nerolidol synthase and at later steps in the pathway."
10889248,gravitropism,Involvement of brassinosteroids in the gravitropic response of primary root of maize,"Exogenously applied brassinolide (BL, 10(-9)-10(-5) M) increased gravitropic curvature in maize (Zea mays) primary roots. The BL-enhanced gravitropic curvature was clearly promoted in the presence of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 10(-10)-10(-8) M), indicating that BL is interactive with IAA during the gravitropic response. The interactive effect between BL and IAA was completely diminished by treatment of p-chlorophenoxy isobutric acid, an auxin action antagonist. The activation of the gravitropic response by BL in the absence and in the presence of IAA was nullified by application of 2, 3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, a polar auxin transport inhibitor. The data indicate that brassinosteroids (BRs) might be involved in auxin-mediated processes for the gravitropic response. Gas chromotography-selected ion-monitoring analysis revealed that maize primary roots contained approximately 0.3 ng g(-1) fresh weight castasterone as an endogenous BR. Exogenously applied castasterone also increased the gravitropic response of maize roots in an IAA-dependent manner. This study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, for occurrence and gravitropic activity of BRs in plant roots."
10889260,protein synthesis,Auxin biosynthesis in maize kernels,"Auxin biosynthesis was analyzed in a maize (Zea mays) kernel culture system in which the seeds develop under physiological conditions similar to the in vivo situation. This system was modified for precursor feeding experiments. Tryptophan (Trp) is efficiently incorporated into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) with retention of the 3, 3' bond. Conversion of Trp to IAA is not competed by indole. Labeling with the general precursors [U-(13)C(6)]glucose and [1, 2-(13)C(2)]acetate followed by retrobiosynthetic analysis strongly suggest that Trp-dependent IAA synthesis is the predominant route for auxin biosynthesis in the maize kernel. The synthesis of IAA from indole glycerol phosphate and IAA formation via condensation of indole with an acetyl-coenzyme A or phosphoenolpyruvate derived metabolite can be excluded."
10889447,wound response,Hydrogen peroxide-mediated catalase gene expression in response to wounding,"The effect of wounding on catalase expression was examined in embryos and leaves of maize. All three Cat genes are upregulated in response to wounding in immature embryos. Cat expression also increased in response to jasmonic acid (JA), raising the possibility that JA and wounding may share a common signal transduction pathway in upregulating Cat mRNA in immature embryos. In young leaves, only Cat1 and Cat3 transcripts increase in response to wounding, but JA does not play a role. Cat1 and Cat3 transcript accumulation also increases in response to wounding in both wild-type and mutant leaves deficient in abscisic acid (ABA), implying that Cat1 and Cat3 induction in response to wounding is not mediated by ABA in leaves. Transient assays using the Cat1 promoter fused with the reporter gene Gus, showed that the DNA sequence motif responsible for Cat1 upregulation by wounding overlaps with the ABA-responsive element (ABRE, G-box) in the Cat1 promoter. The exact nature of the signals triggering the Cat responses to wounding is not clear at this point, but some evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in this response. In fact, we have found that endogenous H(2)O(2) levels increase in wounded leaves. Thus, wounding may indirectly induce the production of H(2)O(2) in leaves, triggering the antioxidant response."
10982449,phytic acid level,Origin and seed phenotype of maize low phytic acid 1-1 and low phytic acid 2-1,"Phytic acid (myo-inositol-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-hexakisphosphate or Ins P(6)) typically represents approximately 75% to 80% of maize (Zea mays) seed total P. Here we describe the origin, inheritance, and seed phenotype of two non-lethal maize low phytic acid mutants, lpa1-1 and lpa2-1. The loci map to two sites on chromosome 1S. Seed phytic acid P is reduced in these mutants by 50% to 66% but seed total P is unaltered. The decrease in phytic acid P in mature lpa1-1 seeds is accompanied by a corresponding increase in inorganic phosphate (P(i)). In mature lpa2-1 seed it is accompanied by increases in P(i) and at least three other myo-inositol (Ins) phosphates (and/or their respective enantiomers): D-Ins(1,2,4,5,6) P(5); D-Ins (1,4,5,6) P(4); and D-Ins(1,2,6) P(3). In both cases the sum of seed P(i) and Ins phosphates (including phytic acid) is constant and similar to that observed in normal seeds. In both mutants P chemistry appears to be perturbed throughout seed development. Homozygosity for either mutant results in a seed dry weight loss, ranging from 4% to 23%. These results indicate that phytic acid metabolism during seed development is not solely responsible for P homeostasis and indicate that the phytic acid concentration typical of a normal maize seed is not essential to seed function."
11094985,days to flowering,Characterization of a gene from Zea mays related to the Arabidopsis flowering-time gene LUMINIDEPENDENS,"The molecular biology of flowering has been most extensively studied in the quantitative long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The Arabidopsis LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) gene encodes a potential transcriptional regulator that acts as a positive effector of flowering, at least in part through suppression of the floral inhibitor gene FLC. As an initial step to explore the conservation of the molecular mechanisms of flowering among plants of various flowering habits, and to further investigate the molecular action(s) of LD, we have identified a gene from maize (Zea mays) that is closely related to Arabidopsis LD. The major product of this gene, which we have designated ZmLD for Zea mays LUMINIDEPENDENS, contains four conserved regions that may constitute functionally important components of the LD proteins. One of these regions closely resembles the canonical homeodomain. The ZmLD gene exists as a single copy in the maize genome, and generates a major ca. 4.0 kb transcript, and a minor ca. 2.6 kb transcript that results from alternative transcriptional termination. The 4.0 kb ZmLD alpha transcript accumulated to highest levels in proliferative tissues, including the shoot apex and developing inflorescences. Expression of ZnLD alpha under control of the Arabidopsis LD promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis caused developmental defects similar to those conferred by loss-of-function mutations in a class of genes involved in maintaining the proliferative nature of the shoot, inflorescence, and floral meristems. These effects were not influenced markedly by the activities of the Arabidopsis LD or FLC genes. We consider the implications for the conservation of LD function between maize and Arabidopsis."
11149942,starch composition,Regulation of starch accumulation by granule-associated plant 14-3-3 proteins,"In higher plants the production of starch is orchestrated by chloroplast-localized biosynthetic enzymes, namely starch synthases, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and starch branching and debranching enzymes. Diurnal regulation of these enzymes, as well as starch-degrading enzymes, influences both the levels and composition of starch, and is dependent in some instances upon phosphorylation-linked regulation. The phosphoserine/threonine-binding 14-3-3 proteins participate in environmentally responsive phosphorylation-related regulatory functions in plants, and as such are potentially involved in starch regulation. We report here that reduction of the epsilon subgroup of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 proteins by antisense technology resulted in a 2- to 4-fold increase in leaf starch accumulation. Dark-governed starch breakdown was unaffected in these antisense plants,"" indicating an unaltered starch-degradation pathway and suggesting a role for 14-3-3 proteins in regulation of starch synthesis. Absorption spectra and gelatinization properties indicate that the starch from the antisense plants has an altered branched glucan composition. Biochemical characterization of protease-treated starch granules from both Arabidopsis leaves and maize endosperm showed that 14-3-3 proteins are internal intrinsic granule proteins. These data suggest a direct role for 14-3-3 proteins in starch accumulation. The starch synthase III family is a possible target for 14-3-3 protein regulation because, uniquely among plastid-localized starch metabolic enzymes, all members of the family contain the conserved 14-3-3 protein phosphoserine/threonine-binding consensus motif. This possibility is strengthened by immunocapture using antibodies to DU1, a maize starch synthase III family member, and direct interaction with biotinylated 14-3-3 protein, both of which demonstrated an association between 14-3-3 proteins and DU1 or DU1-like proteins."""
11161024,germination index,Mitochondrial biogenesis during germination in maize embryos,"Mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism were investigated during maize (Zea mays) seed germination. Mitochondria from dry and imbibed seed exhibited NADH-dependent O(2) uptake that was completely inhibited by KCN and antimycin A. Mitochondria in the dry seed had a lower rate of succinate-dependent O(2) uptake relative to that measured in imbibed and germinated seed. The activities of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, NAD-malic enzyme, and citrate synthase, are similarly low in mitochondria from dry seed and this correlates with a lower relative abundance of the mitochondrial matrix-located citrate synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1alpha-subunit polypeptides. Electron microscopy revealed that mitochondria in the dry seed have a poorly developed internal membrane structure with few cristae; following 24 h of germination the mitochondria developed a more normal structure with more developed cristae. The mitochondria from maize embryos could be fractionated into two subpopulations by Suc density gradient centrifugation: one subpopulation of buoyant density equivalent to 22% to 28% (w/w) Suc; the other equivalent to 37% to 42% (w/w) Suc. These two subpopulations had different activities of specific mitochondrial enzymes and contained different amounts of specific mitochondrial proteins as revealed by western-blot analysis. Both subpopulations from the dry embryo were comprised of poorly developed mitochondria. However, during imbibition mitochondria in the heavy fraction (37%-42% [w/w] Suc) progressively acquired characteristics of fully functional mitochondria found in the germinated seedling in terms of structure, enzymic activity, and protein complement. In contrast, mitochondria in the light fraction (22% to 28% [w/w] Suc) show no significant structural change during imbibition and the amounts of specific mitochondrial proteins decreased significantly during germination."
11171214,oil composition,Phytosterols in the aleurone layer of corn kernels,"Corn hulls are composed of two major layers: the outer layer, the pericarp, is made up of non-living cell walls, and an inner layer, the aleurone, consists of a single layer of living cells, surrounded by thick cell walls. Dissected pure pericarp and aleurone fractions were ground and extracted with hexane and the yields and compositions of the resulting oils were examined. This study revealed that the high levels of ferulate-phytosterol esters and the high concentration of sitostanol previously reported in corn-fibre oil actually originate in the aleurone cells."
11299357,"amino acid, small peptide and protein content",Genetic analysis of amino acid accumulation in opaque-2 maize endosperm,"The opaque-2 mutation in maize (Zea mays) is associated with an increased level of free amino acids (FAA) in the mature endosperm. In particular, there is a high concentration of lysine, the most limiting essential amino acid. To investigate the basis for the high-FAA phenotype of opaque-2 maize, we characterized amino acid accumulation during endosperm development of several wild-type and opaque-2 inbreds. Oh545o2 was found to have an exceptionally high level of FAA, in particular those derived from aspartate (Asp) and intermediates of glycolysis. The FAA content in Oh545o2 is 12 times greater than its wild-type counterpart, and three and 10 times greater than in Oh51Ao2 and W64Ao2, respectively. We crossed Oh545o2 to Oh51Ao2 and analyzed the F(2:3) progeny to identify genetic loci linked with the high FAA level in these mutants. Quantitative trait locus mapping identified four significant loci that account for about 46% of the phenotypic variance. One locus on the long arm of chromosome 2 is coincident with genes encoding a monofunctional Asp kinase 2 and a bifunctional Asp kinase-homo-Ser dehydrogenase-2, whereas another locus on the short arm of chromosome 3 is linked with a cytosolic triose phosphate isomerase 4. The results suggest an alternation of amino acid and carbon metabolism leads to overproduction and accumulation of FAA in opaque-2 mutants."
11431702,days to flowering,Dwarf8 polymorphisms associate with variation in flowering time,"Historically, association tests have been used extensively in medical genetics, but have had virtually no application in plant genetics. One obstacle to their application is the structured populations often found in crop plants, which may lead to nonfunctional, spurious associations. In this study, statistical methods to account for population structure were extended for use with quantitative variation and applied to our evaluation of maize flowering time. Mutagenesis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies suggested that the maize gene Dwarf8 might affect the quantitative variation of maize flowering time and plant height. The wheat orthologs of this gene contributed to the increased yields seen in the 'Green Revolution' varieties. We used association approaches to evaluate Dwarf8 sequence polymorphisms from 92 maize inbred lines. Population structure was estimated using a Bayesian analysis of 141 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Our results indicate that a suite of polymorphisms associate with differences in flowering time, which include a deletion that may alter a key domain in the coding region. The distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms suggests that Dwarf8 has been a target of selection."
11432953,root development,The role of root exudates in aluminium resistance and silicon-induced amelioration of aluminium toxicity in three varieties of maize (Zea mays L.),"Aluminium (Al) toxicity is widely considered to be the most important growth-limiting factor for plants in strongly acid soils (pH<5.0). The inhibition of root elongation in three varieties of maize (Zea mays L. vars Clavito, HS701b and Sikuani) was followed over the first 48 h of Al treatment, and during the initial 10 h elongation was determined on an hourly basis. The silicon (Si)-induced amelioration of Al toxicity was investigated by pre-treating seedlings for 72 h in nutrient solutions with 1000 microM Si before transfer into solutions with 0, 20 or 50 microM Al (without Si). Plants were either grown in complete low ionic strength nutrient solutions (CNS) or in low salt solutions of 0.4 mM CaCl2 (LSS). In addition, the role of root exudation of organic compounds as a mechanism of Si-induced alleviation of Al toxicity was investigated. Aluminium-induced inhibition of root elongation in the maize var. HS701b was observed within 1 h of Al exposure. After a lag time of at least 8 h, Si-induced alleviation of Al toxicity was observed in this variety when grown in LSS. In the Al-resistant var. Sikuani, Al-resistance was only observed after exposure to 50 microM Al, and not after exposure to 20 microM Al, suggesting that there exists a threshold Al concentration before the mechanisms of Al resistance are activated. Aluminium stimulated root exudation of oxalic acid in all three varieties, but exudate concentrations did not increase with either Al resistance or with Si pretreatment. Aluminium and Si triggered release of catechol and of the flavonoid-type phenolics: catechin, and quercetin. In the Al-resistant variety, Sikuani, Al-exposed plants pretreated with Si exuded up to 15 times more phenolics than those plants not pretreated with Si. The flavonoid-type phenolics, to date unconsidered, appear to play a role in the mechanism(s) of Si-induced amelioration of Al toxicity."
11673879,"amino acids, leaf below flag leaf","A comparison of fluorescamine and naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde fluorogenic reagents for microplate-based detection of amino acids","The use of appropriate fluorometric derivatization procedures is of considerable importance for accurate determination of amino acids in biological samples and in metal-assisted peptide hydrolysis reactions. It is especially critical for the relative fluorescence intensities (RFI) of equal amounts of amino acids to be as similar as possible. While fluorescamine and naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) have proven to be excellent fluorogenic reagents for amino acid detection, the effects of various factors such as organic solvent, buffer, and pH have never been rigorously evaluated with respect to normalizing the relative fluorescence intensities of individual amino acids. To this end, here we describe optimized fluorescamine and NDA derivatization reactions that enhance the accuracy of microplate-based detection of amino acids. For both fluorescamine and NDA, we have shown that the RFI values of 16 of 19 amino acids are greater than 70%. Although determination of tryptophan is problematic, this difficulty is overcome by the addition of beta-cyclodextrin to the NDA reaction. In principle, the optimized fluorescamine and NDA microplate procedures reported here can be utilized as complementary techniques for the detection of 19 of 20 naturally occurring amino acids."
11842162,gravitropism,Gravity-stimulated changes in auxin and invertase gene expression in maize pulvinal cells,"Maize (Zea mays) stem gravitropism involves differential elongation of cells within a highly specialized region, the stem internodal pulvinus. In the present study, we investigated factors that control gravitropic responses in this system. In the graviresponding pulvinus, hexose sugars (D-Glc and D-Fru) accumulated asymmetrically across the pulvinus. This correlated well with an asymmetric increase in acid invertase activity across the pulvinus. Northern analyses revealed asymmetric induction of one maize acid invertase gene, Ivr2, consistent with transcriptional regulation by gravistimulation. Several lines of evidence indicated that auxin redistribution, as a result of polar auxin transport, is necessary for gravity-stimulated Ivr2 transcript accumulation and differential cell elongation across the maize pulvinus. First, the auxin transport inhibitor, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, inhibited gravistimulated curvature and Ivr2 transcript accumulation. Second, a transient gradient of free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) across the pulvinus was apparent shortly after initiation of gravistimulation. This temporarily free IAA gradient appears to be important for differential cell elongation and Ivr2 transcript accumulation. This is based on the observation that N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid will not inhibit gravitropic responses when applied to pulvinus tissue after the free IAA gradient peak has occurred. Third, IAA alone can stimulate Ivr2 transcript accumulation in non-gravistimulated pulvini. The gravity- and IAA-stimulated increase in Ivr2 transcripts was sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Based on these results, a two-phase model describing possible relationships between gravitropic curvature, IAA redistribution, and Ivr2 expression is presented."
11999844,"grain yield; grain yield, drought index",Identification of QTLs for root characteristics in maize grown in hydroponics and analysis of their overlap with QTLs for grain yield in the field at two water regimes,"We investigated the overlap among quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in maize for seminal root traits measured in hydroponics with QTLs for grain yield under well-watered (GY-WW) and water-stressed (GY-WS) field conditions as well as for a drought tolerance index (DTI) computed as GY-WS/GY-WW. In hydroponics, 11, 7, 9, and 10 QTLs were identified for primary root length (R1L), primary root diameter (R1D), primary root weight (R1W), and for the weight of the adventitious seminal roots (R2W), respectively. In the field, 7, 8, and 9 QTLs were identified for GY-WW, GY-WS, and DTI, respectively. Despite the weak correlation of root traits in hydroponics with GY-WW, GY-WS, and DTI, a noticeable overlap between the corresponding QTLs was observed. QTLs for R2W most frequently and consistently overlapped with QTLs for GY-WW, GY-WS, and/or DTI. At four QTL regions, an increase in R2W was positively associated with GY-WW, GY-WS, and/or DTI. A 10 cM interval on chromosome 1 between PGAMCTA205 and php20644 showed the strongest effect on R1L, R1D, R2W, GY-WW, GY-WS, and DTI. These results indicate the feasibility of using hydroponics in maize to identify QTL regions controlling root traits at an early growth stage and also influencing GY in the field. A comparative analysis of the QTL regions herein identified with those described in previous studies investigating root traits in different maize populations revealed a number of QTLs in common."
12677406,aflatoxin level,Quantitative trait loci for low aflatoxin production in two related maize populations,"Aflatoxin B(1) formed by Aspergillus flavus Fr:Link has been associated with animal disease and liver cancer in humans. We performed genetic studies in progenies derived from maize inbred Tex6, associated with relatively low levels of aflatoxin production, crossed with the historically important inbred B73. (Tex6 x B73) x B73 BC(1)S(1) and Tex6 x B73 F(2:3) mapping populations were produced and evaluated in 1996 and 1997 in Champaign, Ill. Ears were inoculated 20 to 24 days after midsilk using a pinboard method and a mixture of conidia of A. flavus Link:Fr. isolates. Aflatoxin B(1) levels in harvested ears were determined using an indirect competitive ELISA. Molecular markers were assayed on the populations and used to generate maps. Molecular marker - QTL associations for lower levels of aflatoxin production were determined using multiple regression (MR) and composite interval analysis with multiple regression (CIM MR). MR revealed sets of markers associated with lower aflatoxin production in 1996 and 1997, and CIM MR detected a smaller subset of loci significant in 1997. QTLs for lower aflatoxin were attributed to both Tex6 and B73 parental sources. Environment strongly influenced the detection of QTLs for lower aflatoxin production in different years. There were very few chromosome regions associated with QTLs in more than 1 year or population with MR analysis, and none with CIM MR analysis. In 1997, QTLs for lower aflatoxin were detected with CIM MR in bins 5.01-2 and 5.04-5 in the BC(1)S(1) population, and in bins 3.05-6, 4.07-8 and 10.05-10.07 in the F(2:3) population. These QTL associations appear the most promising for further study."
14523521,zeaxanthin content; beta-cryptoxanthin content; beta-carotene content,QTL and candidate genes phytoene synthase and zeta-carotene desaturase associated with the accumulation of carotenoids in maize,"Carotenoids are a class of fat-soluble antioxidant vitamin compounds present in maize ( Zea mays L.) that may provide health benefits to animals or humans. Four carotenoid compounds are predominant in maize grain: beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein. Although beta-carotene has the highest pro-vitamin A activity, it is present in a relatively low concentration in maize kernels. We set out to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting carotenoid accumulation in maize kernels. Two sets of segregating families were evaluated-a set of F2:3 lines derived from a cross of W64a x A632, and their testcross progeny with AE335. Molecular markers were evaluated on the F2:3 lines and a genetic linkage map created. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to measure beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein on both sets of materials. Composite interval mapping identified chromosome regions with QTL for one or more individual carotenoids in the per se and testcross progenies. Notably QTL in the per se population map to regions with candidate genes, yellow 1 and viviparous 9, which may be responsible for quantitative variation in carotenoids. The yellow 1 gene maps to chromosome six and is associated with phytoene synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the first dedicated step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. The viviparous 9 gene maps to chromosome seven and is associated with zeta-carotene desaturase, an enzyme catalyzing an early step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. If the QTL identified in this study are confirmed, particularly those associated with candidates genes, they could be used in an efficient marker-assisted selection program to facilitate increasing levels of carotenoids in maize grain."
14573493,recombination frequency,High-resolution crossover maps for each bivalent of Zea mays using recombination nodules,"Recombination nodules (RNs) are closely correlated with crossing over, and, because they are observed by electron microscopy of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) in extended pachytene chromosomes, RNs provide the highest-resolution cytological marker currently available for defining the frequency and distribution of crossovers along the length of chromosomes. Using the maize inbred line KYS, we prepared an SC karyotype in which each SC was identified by relative length and arm ratio and related to the proper linkage group using inversion heterozygotes. We mapped 4267 RNs on 2080 identified SCs to produce high-resolution maps of RN frequency and distribution on each bivalent. RN frequencies are closely correlated with both chiasma frequencies and SC length. The total length of the RN recombination map is about twofold shorter than that of most maize linkage maps, but there is good correspondence between the relative lengths of the different maps when individual bivalents are considered. Each bivalent has a unique distribution of crossing over, but all bivalents share a high frequency of distal RNs and a severe reduction of RNs at and near kinetochores. The frequency of RNs at knobs is either similar to or higher than the average frequency of RNs along the SCs. These RN maps represent an independent measure of crossing over along maize bivalents. "

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain yield, plant height, ear height and grain moisture","A previous genetic map containing 117 microsatellite loci and 400 F2 plants was used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in tropical maize. QTL were characterized in a population of 400 F2:3 lines, derived from selfing the F2 plants, and were evaluated with two replications in five environments. QTL determinations were made from the mean of these five environments. Grain yield (GY), plant height (PH), ear height (EH) and grain moisture (GM) were measured. Variance components for genotypes (G), environments (E) and GE interaction were highly significant for all traits. Heritability was 0.69 for GY, 0.66 for PH, 0.67 for EH and 0.23 for GM. Using composite interval mapping (CIM), a total of 13 distinct QTLs were identified: four for GY, four for PH and five for EH. No QTL was detected for GM. The QTL explained 32.73  % of the phenotypic variance of GY, 24.76  % of PH and 20.91  % of EH. The 13 QTLs displayed mostly partial dominance or overdominance gene action and mapped to chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9. Most QTL alleles conferring high values for the traits came from line L-14-4B. Mapping analysis identified genomic regions associated with two or more traits in a manner that was consistent with correlation among traits, supporting either pleiotropy or tight linkage among QTL. The low number of QTLs found, can be due to the great variation that exists among tropical environments.

15075398,response to barley stripe mosaic virus; response to foxtail mosaic virus,"Jittery, a mutator distant relative with a paradoxical mobile behavior: Excision without reinsertion","The unstable mutation bz-m039 arose in a maize (Zea mays) stock that originated from a plant infected with barley stripe mosaic virus. The instability of the mutation is caused by a 3.9-kb mobile element that has been named Jittery (Jit). Jit has terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of 181 bp, causes a 9-bp direct duplication of the target site, and appears to excise autonomously. It is predicted to encode a single 709-amino acid protein, JITA, which is distantly related to the MURA transposase protein of the Mutator system but is more closely related to the MURA protein of Mutator-like elements (MULEs) from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). Like MULEs, Jit resembles Mutator in the length of the element's TIRs, the size of the target site duplication, and in the makeup of its transposase but differs from the autonomous element Mutator-Don Robertson in that it encodes a single protein. Jit also differs from Mutator elements in the high frequency with which it excises to produce germinal revertants and in its copy number in the maize genome: Jit-like TIRs are present at low copy number in all maize lines and teosinte accessions examined, and JITA sequences occur in only a few maize inbreds. However, Jit cannot be considered a bona fide transposon in its present host line because it does not leave footprints upon excision and does not reinsert in the genome. These unusual mobile element properties are discussed in light of the structure and gene organization of Jit and related elements."

The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling cold-related traits and to investigate the relationships among them. A set of 168 F2:4 families of the Lo964 x Lo1016 cross was grown in a sand-vermiculite substrate at 15/13 degrees C (day/night) until the one-leaf stage. Twenty QTL were identified for the four shoot and two seed traits examined. Analysis of root weight and digital measurements of the length and diameter of primary and seminal roots led to the identification of 40 QTL. The operating efficiency of photosystem II (PhiPSII) was related to seedling dry weight at both the phenotypic and genetic level (r = 0.46, two matching loci, respectively) but was not related to root traits. Cluster analysis and QTL association revealed that the different root traits were largely independently inherited and that root lengths and diameters were mostly negatively correlated. The major QTL for root traits detected in an earlier study in hydroponics were confirmed in this study. The length of the primary lateral roots was negatively associated with the germination index (r = -0.38, two matching loci). Therefore, we found a large number of independently inherited loci suitable for the improvement of early seedling growth through better seed vigour and/or a higher rate of photosynthesis."
15611184,days to flowering,Genetic architecture of flowering time in maize as inferred from quantitative trait loci meta-analysis and synteny conservation with the rice genome,"Genetic architecture of flowering time in maize was addressed by synthesizing a total of 313 quantitative trait loci (QTL) available for this trait. These were analyzed first with an overview statistic that highlighted regions of key importance and then with a meta-analysis method that yielded a synthetic genetic model with 62 consensus QTL. Six of these displayed a major effect. Meta-analysis led in this case to a twofold increase in the precision in QTL position estimation, when compared to the most precise initial QTL position within the corresponding region. The 62 consensus QTL were compared first to the positions of the few flowering-time candidate genes that have been mapped in maize. We then projected rice candidate genes onto the maize genome using a synteny conservation approach based on comparative mapping between the maize genetic map and japonica rice physical map. This yielded 19 associations between maize QTL and genes involved in flowering time in rice and in Arabidopsis. Results suggest that the combination of meta-analysis within a species of interest and synteny-based projections from a related model plant can be an efficient strategy for identifying new candidate genes for trait variation."

Here, we report the identification of a small maize protein of 94 amino acids involved in short-range signaling required for pollen tube attraction by the female gametophyte. ZmEA1 is exclusively expressed in the egg apparatus, consisting of the egg cell and two synergids. Chimeric ZmEA1 fused to green fluorescent protein (ZmEA1:GFP) was first visible within the filiform apparatus and later was localized to nucellar cell walls below the micropylar opening of the ovule. Transgenic down-regulation of the ZmEA1 gene led to ovule sterility caused by loss of close-range pollen tube guidance to the micropyle."
15806344,maysin content,"Association analysis of candidate genes for maysin and chlorogenic acid accumulation in maize silks.

","Two compounds, the C-glycosyl flavone maysin and the phenylpropanoid product chlorogenic acid (CGA), have been implicated in corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie) resistance in maize (Zea mays L.). Previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses identified the pericarp color (p) locus, which encodes a transcription factor, as the major QTL for maysin and CGA. QTL analysis has also implicated the dihydroflavanol reductase (DFR; E.C. no. 1.1.1.219) locus anthocyaninless1 (a1) and the duplicate chalcone synthase (CHS; E.C. no. 2.3.1.74) loci colorless2 (c2) and white pollen1 (whp1) as genes underlying QTL for maysin and/or CGA synthesis. Epistatic interactions between p and a1 and between p and c2 were also defined. CHS catalyzes the first step in the flavonoid pathway and represents one of the first enzyme steps following the branch off the general phenylpropanoid pathway towards CGA synthesis. In maize, the reduction of dihydroflavanol to leucoanthocyanin by DFR immediately follows the pathway branch leading to C-glycosyl flavone production. The detection of QTLs for maysin and CGA concentration at loci encoding enzyme steps following the pathway branch points implicates alterations in the flow of biochemical intermediates as the biological basis of the QTL effects. To examine if sequence variation among alleles of a1, c2, and whp1 affect maysin and CGA synthesis in maize silks, we performed an association analysis. Because the p locus has often been a major QTL for maysin and CGA and has exhibited epistatic interactions with a1, c2, and whp1, association analysis was conditioned on the p genotype. A highly significant association of two sequence polymorphisms in the promoter of a1 with maysin synthesis was demonstrated. Additional conditioning on the genotype of the significant a1 polymorphism allowed the detection of a significant polymorphism within the whp1 promoter. Our analyses demonstrate that conditioning for epistatic factors greatly increases the power of association testing.

and zfl2 on Traits Under Selection During Maize Domestication","Phenotypic variation on which selection can act during evolution may be caused by variation in activity 
level of developmental regulatory genes. In many cases, however, such genes affect multiple traits. This 
situation can lead to co-evolution of traits, or evolutionary constraint if some pleiotropic effects are det- 
rimental. Here, we present an analysis of quantitative traits associated with gene copy number of two 
important maize regulatory genes, the duplicate FLORICAULA/LEAFY orthologs zfl1 and zfl2. We found 
statistically significant associations between several quantitative traits and copy number of both zfl genes in 
several maize genetic backgrounds. Despite overlap in traits associated with these duplicate genes, zfl1 
showed stronger associations with flowering time, while zfl2 associated more strongly with branching and 
inflorescence structure traits, suggesting some divergence of function. Since zfl2 associates with quan- 
titative variation for ear rank and also maps near a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2 con- 
trolling ear rank differences between maize and teosinte, we tested whether zfl2 might have been involved 
in the evolution of this trait using a QTL complementation test. The results suggest that zfl2 activity is 
important for the QTL effect, supporting zfl2 as a candidate gene for a role in morphological evolution of maize. "
16244856,days to flowering,Mapping of a spontaneous mutation for early flowering time in maize highlights contrasting allelic series at two-linked QTL on chromosome 8,"Only a few mutations affecting flowering time have been detected in maize. We analyzed a spontaneous early mutation, vgt-f7p, which appeared during production of the inbred line F7. This mutation shortens the time from planting to flowering by about 100 growing degree days (GDD), and reduces the number of nodes. It therefore seems to affect the timing of meristem differentiation from a vegetative to a reproductive state. It was mapped to a 6 cM confidence interval on chromosome 8, using a QTL mapping approach. QTL analysis of a mapping population generated by crossing the mutant F7 line (F7p) and the Gaspe flint population showed that vgt-f7p is probably allelic to vgt1, a QTL described in previous studies, and affects earliness more strongly than the Gaspe allele at vgt1. Global analysis of the QTL in the region suggested that there may be two consensus QTL, vgt1 and vgt2. These two QTL have contrasting allelic effects: rare alleles conferring extremely early flowering at vgt1 vs. greater diversity and milder effects at locus vgt2. Finally, detailed syntenic analysis showed that the vgt1 region displays a highly conserved duplicated region on chromosome 6, which also plays an important role in maize flowering time variation. The cloning of vgt1 should, therefore, also facilitate the analysis of the molecular basis of variation due to this second region."

Although this necessary phenotypic variability exists in diverse maize, most research is conducted using a small subset of inbred lines. An association population of 302 lines is now available--a valuable research tool that captures a large proportion of the alleles in cultivated maize. Provided that appropriate statistical models correcting for population structure are included, this tool can be used in association analyses to provide high-resolution evaluation of multiple alleles. This study describes the population structure of the 302 lines, and investigates the relationship between population structure and various measures of phenotypic and breeding value. On average, our estimates of population structure account for 9.3% of phenotypic variation, roughly equivalent to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), with a high of 35%. Inclusion of population structure in association models is critical to meaningful analyses. This new association population has the potential to identify QTL with small effects, which will aid in dissecting complex traits and in planning future projects to exploit the rich diversity present in maize."
16395569,tassel branch angle; tassel spike length; tassel branch number,Genetic and QTL analysis of maize tassel and ear inflorescence architecture,"Maize (Zea mays L.) ear inflorescence architecture is directly relevant to grain yield components, and tassel architecture is relevant to hybrid seed production. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine heritabilities and correlations of a comprehensive set of tassel and ear inflorescence architecture traits in a set of (Illinois Low ProteinxB73) B73 S(1) families, (2) identify chromosomal positions of QTL affecting tassel and ear architecture, and (3) identify possible candidate genes associated with these QTL. For tassel traits, the number of detected QTL ranged from one to five, and explained between 6.5 and 35.9% of phenotypic variation. For ear traits, the number of detected QTL ranged from one to nine and phenotypic variation explained by those QTL varied between 7.9 and 53.0%. We detected QTL for tassel architecture traits that required calculation of ratios from measured traits. Some of these calculated traits QTL were detected in regions that did not show QTL for the measured traits, suggesting that calculation of ratios may reveal developmentally relevant patterns of tassel architecture. We detected a QTL on chromosome 7 for tassel branch number near the gene ramosa1 (ra1), which is known to control tassel branch number, making ra1 a candidate gene for tassel branch number. We detected QTL for several traits on chromosomes 6, 8, and 9, where no inflorescence architecture genes have been mapped, thus providing initial information towards new gene discovery for control of inflorescence architecture."
16784536,days to flowering,The maize INDETERMINATE1 flowering time regulator defines a highly conserved zinc finger protein family in higher plants.,"BACKGROUND: The maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, ID1, is a key regulator of the transition to flowering and the founding member of a transcription factor gene family that encodes a protein with a distinct arrangement of zinc finger motifs. The zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make up the signature ID domain (IDD), which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes. The presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that ID1 binds to DNA suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation. RESULTS: Comparison of IDD genes identified in Arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all IDD genes discovered in maize EST and genomic databases, suggest that ID1 is a unique member of this gene family. High levels of sequence similarity amongst all IDD genes from maize, rice and Arabidopsis suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Several unique features of ID1 suggest that it is a divergent member of the maize IDD family. Although no clear ID1 ortholog was identified in the Arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond the ID domain were isolated from rice and sorghum. Phylogenetic comparisons show that these putative orthologs, along with maize ID1, form a group separate from other IDD genes. In contrast to ID1 mRNA, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize IDD genes showed a broad range of expression in various tissues. Further, Western analysis with an antibody that cross-reacts with ID1 protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three proteins are detected in immature leaves only. CONCLUSION: Comparative genomic analysis shows that the IDD zinc finger family is highly conserved among both monocots and dicots. The leaf-specific ID1 expression pattern distinguishes it from other maize IDD genes examined. A similar leaf-specific localization pattern was observed for the putative ID1 protein orthologs from rice and sorghum. These similarities between ID1 and closely related genes in other grasses point to possible similarities in function."

Regression and interval mapping analyses gave largely congruent results concerning the numbers of loci controlling the morphological traits and the magnitudes of their effects; however, interval mapping tended to give larger estimates for the magnitudes of the effects of the morphological trait loci. This tendency was exaggerated for traits that were non-normally distributed. Variation for most inflorescence traits is controlled by one or two regions of the genome with large effects plus several other regions with relatively small effects. As such, the data are congruent with a mode of inheritance for most traits involving one or two major loci plus several minor loci. Regions of the genome with large effects on one trait consistently had smaller effects on several other traits, possibly as a result of pleiotropy. Most of the variation for the dramatic differences in inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte is explained by five restricted regions of the genome. One of these regions encompasses a previously described gene, tb1 (teosinte branched), and the effects of this region on inflorescence architecture are similar to the known effects of tb1. Implications of this work for the genetic basis of morphological evolution in plants are discussed."
17461782,"malate, leaf below flag leaf; fumarate, leaf below flag leaf",Deficiency of mitochondrial fumarase activity in tomato plants impairs photosynthesis via an effect on stomatal function,"Transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants expressing a fragment of a fumarate hydratase (fumarase) gene in the antisense orientation and exhibiting considerable reductions in the mitochondrial activity of this enzyme show impaired photosynthesis. The rate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was reduced in the transformants relative to the other major pathways of carbohydrate oxidation and the plants were characterized by a restricted rate of dark respiration. However, biochemical analyses revealed relatively little alteration in leaf metabolism as a consequence of reducing the fumarase activity. That said, in comparison to wild-type plants, CO(2) assimilation was reduced by up to 50% under atmospheric conditions and plants were characterized by a reduced biomass on a whole plant basis. Analysis of further photosynthetic parameters revealed that there was little difference in pigment content in the transformants but that the rate of transpiration and stomatal conductance was markedly reduced. Analysis of the response of the rate of photosynthesis to variation in the concentration of CO(2) confirmed that this restriction was due to a deficiency in stomatal function."

Recently, two new maize populations were derived for high silk maysin. The two populations were named the exotic populations of maize (EPM) and the southern inbreds of maize (SIM). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was employed to determine which loci were responsible for elevated maysin levels in inbred lines derived from the EPM and SIM populations. The candidate genes consistent with QTL position included the p (pericarp color), c2 (colorless2), whp1 (white pollen1) and in1 (intensifier1) loci. The role of these loci in controlling high maysin levels in silks was tested by expression analysis and use of the loci as genetic markers onto the QTL populations. These studies support p, c2 and whp1, but not in1, as loci controlling maysin. Through this study, we determined that the p locus regulates whp1 transcription and that increased maysin in these inbred lines was primarily due to alleles at both structural and regulatory loci promoting increased flux through the flavone pathway by increasing chalcone synthase activity."
17595297,days to flowering,Conserved noncoding genomic sequences associated with a flowering-time quantitative trait locus in maize,"Flowering time is a fundamental trait of maize adaptation to different agricultural environments. Although a large body of information is available on the map position of quantitative trait loci for flowering time, little is known about the molecular basis of quantitative trait loci. Through positional cloning and association mapping, we resolved the major flowering-time quantitative trait locus, Vegetative to generative transition 1 (Vgt1), to an 2-kb noncoding region positioned 70 kb upstream of an Ap2-like transcription factor that we have shown to be involved in flowering-time control. Vgt1 functions as a cis-acting regulatory element as indicated by the correlation of the Vgt1 alleles with the transcript expression levels of the downstream gene. Additionally, within Vgt1, we identified evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences across the maizesorghumrice lineages. Our results support the notion that changes in distant cis-acting regulatory regions are a key component of plant genetic adaptation throughout breeding and evolution."

18688729,Stress response,Significant improvement of stress tolerance in tobacco plants by overexpressing a stress-responsive aldehyde dehydrogenase gene from maize (Zea mays).,"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) play a central role in detoxification processes of aldehydes generated in plants when exposed to the stressed conditions. In order to identify genes required for the stresses responses in the grass crop Zea mays, an ALDH (ZmALDH22A1) gene was isolated and characterized. ZmALDH22A1 belongs to the family ALDH22 that is currently known only in plants. The ZmALDH22A1 encodes a protein of 593 amino acids that shares high identity with the orthologs from Saccharum officinarum (95%), Oryza sativa (89%), Triticum aestivum (87%) and Arabidopsis thaliana (77%), respectively. Real-time PCR analysis indicates that ZmALDH22A1 is expressed differentially in different tissues. Various elevated levels of ZmALDH22A1 expression have been detected when the seedling roots exposed to abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). Tomato stable transformation of construct expressing the ZmALDH22A1 signal peptide fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the CaMV35S-promoter reveals that the fusion protein is targeted to plastid. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing ZmALDH22A1 shows elevated stresses tolerance. Stresses tolerance in transgenic plants is accompanied by a reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) derived from cellular lipid peroxidation."
18944622,response to Aspergillus flavus; aflatoxin level,Inheritance of resistance to aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin production of corn from Tex6,"ABSTRACT The inheritance of resistance to Aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin production in corn (Zea mays L.) caused by Aspergillus flavus was studied in progeny derived from crosses between the resistant corn inbred cv. Tex6 and susceptible inbred cvs. B73 and Mo17. From 1994 to 1996, plant generations included were the P(1) (susceptible B73 or Mo17), P(2) (resistant Tex6), F(1), F(2), F(3), BCP(1), BCP(1)-selfed, and BCP(2). The BCP(2)-selfed generation was added in 1995 and 1996 for the B73 x Tex6 cross. Primary ears were pinboard inoculated and evaluated for Aspergillus ear rot severity. F(1) means deviated from the midparent value toward resistance for aflatoxin production and toward susceptibility for ear rot in both crosses. Analyses of generation means indicate that additive gene action was most important in the resistance to both ear rot and aflatoxin production in the B73 x Tex6 cross. Mo17 was somewhat resistant to both traits, so resistance from Tex6 was not well defined in this cross. Broad-sense heritabilities for ear rot and aflatoxin production were 58 and 63% for Mo17 x Tex6, and 66 and 65% for B73 x Tex6. Narrow-sense heritabilities for ear rot and aflatoxin production were 39 and 45% for B73 x Tex6. It is estimated that one cycle of selection for resistance within B73 x Tex6 F(3) families would reduce the percentage of ear rot severity by 8.5% and aflatoxin concentration by 19 ng/g."
19054347,"nitrate, leaf below flag leaf",Adjustment of growth and central metabolism to a mild but sustained nitrogen-limitation in Arabidopsis,"We have established a simple soil-based experimental system that allows a small and sustained restriction of growth of Arabidopsis by low nitrogen (N). Plants were grown in a large volume of a peat-vermiculite mix that contained very low levels of inorganic N. As a control, inorganic N was added in solid form to the peat-vermiculite mix, or plants were grown in conventional nutrient-rich solids. The low N growth regime led to a sustained 20% decrease of the relative growth rate over a period of 2 weeks, resulting in a two- to threefold decrease in biomass in 35- to 40-day-old plants. Plants in the low N regime contained lower levels of nitrate, lower nitrate reductase activity, lower levels of malate, fumarate and other organic acids and slightly higher levels of starch, as expected from published studies of N-limited plants. However, their rosette protein content was unaltered, and total and many individual amino acid levels increased compared with N-replete plants. This metabolic phenotype reveals that Arabidopsis responds adaptively to low N by decreasing the rate of growth, while maintaining the overall protein content, and maintaining or even increasing the levels of many amino acids."

Most transcriptome changes are stage specific: cases of suppression of normal transcripts and ectopic activation are equally represented. Protein abundance changes were validated for numerous metabolic enzymes, and highlight the increased carbon and reactive oxygen management in Mutator anthers. Active Mutator lines appear to experience chronic stress, on a par with abiotic treatments that stimulate early flowering. Despite the diversity of acclimation responses, anther development progresses normally, in contrast to male-sterile mutants that disrupt anther cell fate or function completely, and cause fewer transcriptome changes. The early flowering phenotype ultimately confers an advantage in Mu element transmission."

We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis."
1976254,response to sethoxydim; response to haloxyfop,Dominant mutations causing alterations in acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase confer tolerance to cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides in maize,"A partially dominant mutation exhibiting increased tolerance to cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides was isolated by exposing susceptible maize (Zea mays) tissue cultures to increasingly inhibitory concentrations of sethoxydim (a cyclohexanedione). The selected tissue culture (S2) was greater than 40-fold more tolerant to sethoxydim and 20-fold more tolerant to haloxyfop (an aryloxyphenoxypropionate) than the nonselected wild-type tissue culture. Regenerated S2 plants were heterozygous for the mutant allele and exhibited a high-level, but not complete, tolerance to both herbicides. Homozygous mutant families derived by self-pollinating the regenerated S2 plants exhibited no injury after treatment with 0.8 kg of sethoxydim per ha, which was greater than 16-fold the rate lethal to wild-type plants. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) is the target enzyme of cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides. ACCase activities of the nonselected wild-type and homozygous mutant seedlings were similar in the absence of herbicide. ACCase activity from homozygous tolerant plants required greater than 100-fold more sethoxydim and 16-fold more haloxyfop for 50% inhibition than ACCase from wild-type plants. These results indicate that tolerance to sethoxydim and haloxyfop is controlled by a partially dominant nuclear mutation encoding a herbicide-insensitive alteration in maize ACCase."

In maize, however, little is known about its molecular basis. In this study, we report the fine-mapping and characterization of a major quantitative trait locus located on maize chromosome 10 that regulates flowering time through photoperiod sensitivity. This study was performed in near-isogenic material derived from a cross between the day-neutral European flint inbred line FV286 and the tropical short-day inbred line FV331. Recombinant individuals were identified among a large segregating population and their progenies were scored for flowering time. Combined genotypic characterization led to delimit the QTL to an interval of 170 kb and highlighted an unbalanced recombination pattern. Two BACs covering the region were analyzed to identify putative candidate genes and synteny with rice, sorghum and brachypodium was investigated. A gene encoding a CCT domain protein homologous to the rice Ghd7 heading date regulator was identified, but its causative role was not demonstrated and deserves further analyses. Finally, an association study showed a strong level of linkage disequilibrium over the region and highlighted haplotypes that could provide useful information for the exploitation of genetic resources and marker-assisted selection in maize."

Maize possesses homologs of many genes identified as regulators of flowering time in other species, but their relation to the natural variation for photoperiod response in maize is unknown. Candidate gene sequences were mapped in four populations created by crossing two temperate inbred lines to two photoperiod-sensitive tropical inbreds. Whole-genome scans were conducted by high-density genotyping of the populations, which were phenotyped over 3 years in both short- and long-day environments. Joint multiple population analysis identified genomic regions controlling photoperiod responses in flowering time, plant height, and total leaf number. Four key genome regions controlling photoperiod response across populations were identified, referred to as ZmPR1-4. Functional allelic differences within these regions among phenotypically similar founders suggest distinct evolutionary trajectories for photoperiod adaptation in maize. These regions encompass candidate genes CCA/LHY, CONZ1, CRY2, ELF4, GHD7, VGT1, HY1/SE5, TOC1/PRR7/PPD-1, PIF3, ZCN8, and ZCN19."

To gain insight into their functions, we generated transgenic maize plants overexpressing their respective cDNAs driven by a constitutive promoter. Overall, ectopic expression of the maize TFL1-like genes produced similar phenotypes, including delayed flowering and altered inflorescence architecture. We observed an apparent relationship between the magnitude of the transgenic phenotypes and the degree of homology between the ZCN proteins. ZCN2, -4, and -5 form a monophylogenetic clade, and their overexpression produced the strongest phenotypes. Along with very late flowering, these transgenic plants produced a "

Although many male-sterile mutants disrupt these key steps, few have been investigated in detail. The terminal phenotypes of Zea mays (maize) male sterile 8 (ms8) are small anthers exhibiting meiotic failure. Here, we document much earlier defects: ms8 epidermal cells are normal in number but fail to elongate, and there are fewer, larger tapetal cells that retain, rather than secrete, their contents. ms8 meiocytes separate early, have extra space between them, occupied by excess callose, and the meiotic dyads abort. Thousands of transcriptome changes occur in ms8, including ectopic activation of genes not expressed in fertile siblings, failure to express some genes, differential expression compared with fertile siblings and about 40% of the differentially expressed transcripts appear precociously. There is a high correlation between mRNA accumulation assessed by microarray hybridization and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Sixty-three differentially expressed proteins were identified after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy, including those involved in metabolism, plasmodesmatal remodeling and cell division. The majority of these were not identified by differential RNA expression, demonstrating the importance of proteomics in defining developmental mutants."

While changes in the levels of sugars and abscisic acid (ABA) are thought to play a role in this stress response, the mechanistic basis and genes involved are not known. A candidate gene approach was used with association mapping to identify loci involved in accumulation of carbohydrates and ABA metabolites during stress. A panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from these metabolic pathways and in genes for reproductive development and stress response was used to genotype 350 tropical and subtropical maize inbred lines that were well watered or water stressed at flowering. Pre-pollination ears, silks, and leaves were analysed for sugars, starch, proline, ABA, ABA-glucose ester, and phaseic acid. ABA and sugar levels in silks and ears were negatively correlated with their growth. Association mapping with 1229 SNPs in 540 candidate genes identified an SNP in the maize homologue of the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene, PISTILLATA, which was significantly associated with phaseic acid in ears of well-watered plants, and an SNP in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, a key regulator of carbon flux into respiration, that was associated with silk sugar concentration. An SNP in an aldehyde oxidase gene was significantly associated with ABA levels in silks of water-stressed plants. Given the short range over which decay of linkage disequilibrium occurs in maize, the results indicate that allelic variation in these genes affects ABA and carbohydrate metabolism in floral tissues during drought."

The maize NAM population, consisting of 5,000 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from 25 families representing the global diversity of maize, was evaluated for resistance to southern leaf blight (SLB) disease. Joint-linkage analysis identified 32 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with predominantly small, additive effects on SLB resistance. Genome-wide association tests of maize HapMap SNPs were conducted by imputing founder SNP genotypes onto the NAM RILs. SNPs both within and outside of QTL intervals were associated with variation for SLB resistance. Many of these SNPs were within or near sequences homologous to genes previously shown to be involved in plant disease resistance. Limited linkage disequilibrium was observed around some SNPs associated with SLB resistance, indicating that the maize NAM population enables high-resolution mapping of some genome regions."

Plant MAPK cascades have been implicated in development and stress response. In this study, we isolated a novel group C MAPKK gene, ZmMKK4, from maize. Northern blotting analysis revealed that the ZmMKK4 transcript expression was up-regulated by cold, high salt and exogenous H(2)O(2,) but down-regulated by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Over-expression of ZmMKK4 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold and salt stresses by increased germination rate, lateral root numbers, plant survival rate, chlorophyll, proline and soluble sugar contents, and antioxidant enzyme [peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT)] activities compared with control plants. Furthermore, ZmMKK4 enhanced a 37 kDa kinase activity after cold and salt stresses. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript levels of stress-responsive transcription factors and functional genes were higher in ZmMKK4-over-expressing plants than in control plants. In addition, ZmMKK4 protein is localized in the nucleus. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmMKK4 is a positive regulator of salt and cold tolerance in plants."

To gain insights into the genetic architecture of quantitative resistance in maize, we evaluated a 5,000-inbred-line nested association mapping population for resistance to northern leaf blight, a maize disease of global economic importance. Twenty-nine quantitative trait loci were identified, and most had multiple alleles. The large variation in resistance phenotypes could be attributed to the accumulation of numerous loci of small additive effects. Genome-wide nested association mapping, using 1.6 million SNPs, identified multiple candidate genes related to plant defense, including receptor-like kinase genes similar to those involved in basal defense. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that quantitative disease resistance in plants is conditioned by a range of mechanisms and could have considerable mechanistic overlap with basal resistance."

","Plants are attacked by pathogens representing diverse taxonomic groups, such that genes providing multiple disease resistance (MDR) are expected to be under positive selection pressure. To address the hypothesis that naturally occurring allelic variation conditions MDR, we extended the framework of structured association mapping to allow for the analysis of correlated complex traits and the identification of pleiotropic genes. The multivariate analytical approach used here is directly applicable to any species and set of traits exhibiting correlation. From our analysis of a diverse panel of maize inbred lines, we discovered high positive genetic correlations between resistances to three globally threatening fungal diseases. The maize panel studied exhibits rapidly decaying linkage disequilibrium that generally occurs within 1 or 2 kb, which is less than the average length of a maize gene. The positive correlations therefore suggested that functional allelic variation at specific genes for MDR exists in maize. Using a multivariate test statistic, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene was found to be associated with modest levels of resistance to all three diseases. Resequencing analysis pinpointed the association to a histidine (basic amino acid) for aspartic acid (acidic amino acid) substitution in the encoded protein domain that defines GST substrate specificity and biochemical activity. The known functions of GSTs suggested that variability in detoxification pathways underlie natural variation in maize MDR."

Identification of alleles controlling leaf angle in maize is needed to provide insight into molecular mechanism of leaf development and achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield.<p> Methodology/Principal Findings: The gene cloning was done by using comparative genomics, and then performing real- time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to assay gene expression. The gene function was validated by sequence dissimilarity analysis and QTL mapping using a functional cleaved amplified polymorphism (CAP).<p> Conclusions: The leaf angle is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, ZmTAC1 (Zea mays L. Leaf Angle Control 1). ZmTAC1 has 4 exons encoding a protein with 263 amino acids, and its domains are the same as those of the rice OsTAC1 protein. ZmTAC1 was found to be located in the region of qLA2 by using the CAP marker and the F2:3 families from the cross between Yu82 and Shen137. Real-time PCR analysis revealed ZmTAC1 expression was the highest in the leaf-sheath pulvinus, less in the leaf and shoot apical meristem, and the lowest in the root. A nucleotide difference in the 5'- untranslated region (UTR) between the compact inbred line Yu82 (""CTCC"") and the expanded inbred line Shen137 (""CCCC"") influences the expression level of ZmTAC1, further controlling the size of the leaf angle. Sequence verification of the change in the 5'-UTR revealed ZmTAC1 with ""CTCC"" was present in 13 compact inbred lines and ZmTAC1 with ""CCCC"" was present in 18 expanded inbred lines, indicating ZmTAC1 had been extensively utilized in breeding with regard to the improvement of the maize plant architecture."

21999882,insect response; internode basal ring length,Is the Basal Area of Maize Internodes Involved in Borer Resistance?,"ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: To elucidate the role of the length of the internode basal ring (LIBR) in resistance to the Mediterranean corn borer (MCB), we carried out a divergent selection program to modify the LIBR using two maize synthetic varieties (EPS20 and EPS21), each with a different genetic background. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms underlying the relationship between the LIBR and borer resistance. Selection to lengthen or shorten the LIBR was achieved for each synthetic variety. The resulting plants were analyzed to determine their LIBR response, growth, yield, and borer resistance. RESULTS: In the synthetic variety EPS20 (Reid germplasm), reduction of the LIBR improved resistance against the MCB. The LIBR selection was also effective in the synthetic variety EPS21 (non-Reid germplasm), although there was no relationship detected between the LIBR and MCB resistance. The LIBR did not show correlations with agronomic traits such as plant height and yield. Compared with upper sections, the internode basal ring area contained lower concentrations of cell wall components such as acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), and diferulates. In addition, some residual 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one (DIMBOA), a natural antibiotic compound, was detected in the basal area at 30 days after silking. CONCLUSION: We analyzed maize selections to determine whether the basal area of maize internodes is involved in borer resistance. The structural reinforcement of the cell walls was the most significant trait in the relationship between the LIBR and borer resistance. Lower contents of ADF and ADL in the rind of the basal section facilitated the entry of larvae in this area in both synthetic varieties, while lower concentrations of diferulates in the pith basal section of EPS20 facilitated larval feeding inside the stem. The higher concentrations of DIMBOA may have contributed to the lack of correlation between the LIBR and borer resistance in EPS21. This novel trait could be useful in maize breeding programs to improve borer resistance."

Trait genotypic variation within a family is indicative of the family's informativeness for genetic studies. Accurate prediction of the most useful parental combinations within a species would help guide quantitative genetics studies. We tested the reliability of genotypic and phenotypic distance estimators between pairs of maize inbred lines to predict genotypic variation for quantitative traits within families derived from biparental crosses. We developed 25 families composed of 200 random recombinant inbred lines each from crosses between a common reference parent inbred, B73, and 25 diverse maize inbreds. Parents and families were evaluated for 19 quantitative traits across up to 11 environments. Genetic distances (GDs) among parents were estimated with 44 simple sequence repeat and 2303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. GDs among parents had no predictive value for progeny variation, which is most likely due to the choice of neutral markers. In contrast, we observed for about half of the traits measured a positive correlation between phenotypic parental distances and within-family genetic variance estimates. Consequently, the choice of promising segregating populations can be based on selecting phenotypically diverse parents. These results are congruent with models of genetic architecture that posit numerous genes affecting quantitative traits, each segregating for allelic series, with dispersal of allelic effects across diverse genetic material. This architecture, common to many quantitative traits in maize, limits the predictive value of parental genotypic or phenotypic values on progeny variance.Heredity advance online publication, 26 October 2011; doi:10.1038/hdy.2011.103."

Inflorescence loci have larger effects than flowering and leaf loci, and ear effects are larger than tassel effects. Ear trait models also have lower predictive ability than tassel, flowering, or leaf trait models. Pleiotropic loci were identified that control elongation of ear and tassel, consistent with their common developmental origin. For these pleiotropic loci, the ear effects are larger than tassel effects even though the same causal polymorphisms are likely involved. This implies that the observed differences in genetic architecture are not due to distinct features of the underlying polymorphisms. Our results support the hypothesis that genetic architecture is a function of trait stability over evolutionary time, since the traits that changed most during the relatively recent domestication of maize have the largest effects."
22135431,"kernel composition; oil content  kernel; starch content, kernel; protein content, kernel",Genetic architecture of maize kernel composition in the nested association mapping and inbred association panels,"The maize (Zea mays) kernel plays a critical role in feeding humans and livestock around the world and in a wide array of industrial applications. An understanding of the regulation of kernel starch, protein, and oil is needed in order to manipulate composition to meet future needs. We conducted joint-linkage quantitative trait locus mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for kernel starch, protein, and oil in the maize nested association mapping population, composed of 25 recombinant inbred line families derived from diverse inbred lines. Joint-linkage mapping revealed that the genetic architecture of kernel composition traits is controlled by 21-26 quantitative trait loci. Numerous GWAS associations were detected, including several oil and starch associations in acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase1-2, a gene that regulates oil composition and quantity. Results from nested association mapping were verified in a 282 inbred association panel using both GWAS and candidate gene association approaches. We identified many beneficial alleles that will be useful for improving kernel starch, protein, and oil content."
22332840,response to sugarcane mosaic virus; response to Pennisetum mosaic virus,Possible involvement of maize Rop1 in the defence responses of plants to viral infection.,"The expression of host genes can be altered during the process of viral infection. To investigate the viral infection-induced up-regulated gene expression changes of maize at different time intervals post-inoculation with Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), a suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library was constructed. A total of 454 cDNA clones were identified to be viral infection-induced up-regulated genes. The influence of Rop1 on the infection of maize by SCMV was investigated. The results showed that transient silencing of the ZmRop1 gene through virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the accumulation and systemic infection of SCMV and another potyvirus (Pennisetum mosaic virus) in maize plants, whereas transient over-expression of ZmRop1 in maize protoplasts reduced SCMV accumulation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the heterologous expression of ZmRop1 impaired Potato virus X infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These data suggest that ZmRop1 may play a role in plant defence responses to viral infection."
22348228,response to Bipolaris maydis,Identification and fine mapping of rhm1 locus for resistance to Southern corn leaf blight in maize.,"rhm1 is a major recessive disease resistance locus for Southern corn leaf blight (SCLB). To further narrow down its genetic position, F(2) population and BC(1) F(1) population derived from the cross between resistant (H95(rhm) ) and susceptible parents (H95) of maize (Zea mays) were constructed. Using newly developed markers, rhm1 was initially delimited within an interval of 2.5 Mb, and then finally mapped to a 8.56 kb interval between InDel marker IDP961-503 and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker A194149-1. Three polymorphic markers IDP961-504, IDP B2-3 and A194149-2 were shown to be co-segregated with the rhm1 locus. Sequence analysis of the 8.56 kb DNA fragment revealed that it contained only one putative gene with a predicted amino acid sequence identical to lysine histidine transporter 1 (LHT1). Comparative sequence analysis indicated that the LHT1 in H95(rhm) harbors a 354 bp insertion in its third exon as compared with that of susceptible alleles in B73, H95 and Mo17. The 354 bp insertion resulted in a truncation of the predicted protein of candidate resistance allele (LHT1-H95(rhm) ). Our results strongly suggest LHT1 as the candidate gene for rhm1 against SCLB. The tightly linked molecular markers developed in this study can be directly used for molecular breeding of resistance to Southern corn leaf blight in maize."
22366304,environmental stress response,Genome-wide analysis and environmental response profiling of the FK506-binding protein gene family in maize (Zea mays L.).,"The FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) belong to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, and have been implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes, including protein folding, hormone signaling, plant growth, and stress responses. Genome-wide structural and evolutionary analyses of the entire FKBP gene family have been conducted in Arabidopsis and rice. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis was performed to identify all maize FKBP genes. The availability of complete maize genome sequences allowed for the identification of 24 FKBP genes. Chromosomal locations in the maize genome were determined and the protein domain and motif organization of ZmFKBPs analyzed. The phylogenetic relationships between maize FKBPs were also assessed. The expression profiles of ZmFKBP genes were measured under different environmental conditions and revealed distinct ZmFKBP gene expression patterns under heat, cold, salt, and drought stress. These data not only contribute to a better understanding of the complex regulation of the maize FKBP gene family, but also provide evidence supporting the role of FKBPs in multiple signaling pathways involved in stress responses. This investigation may provide valuable information for further research on stress tolerance in plants and potential strategies for enhancing maize survival under stressful conditions."
22702356,response to UV radiation,Analysis of the P1 promoter in response to UV-B radiation in allelic variants of high-altitude maize.,"Background: Plants living at high altitudes are typically exposed to elevated UV-B radiation, and harbor mechanisms to prevent the induced damage, such as the accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds. The maize R2R3-MYB transcription factor P1 controls the accumulation of several UV-B absorbing phenolics by activating a subset of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in leaves of maize landraces adapted to high altitudes. 

Results: Here, we studied the UV-B regulation of P1 in maize leaves of high altitude landraces, and we investigated how UV-B regulates P1 binding to the CHS promoter in both low and high altitude lines. In addition, we analyzed whether the expansion in the P1 expression domain between these maize landraces and inbred lines is associated to changes in the molecular structure of the proximal promoter, distal enhancer and first intron of P1. Finally, using transient expression experiments in protoplasts from various maize genotypes, we investigated whether the different expression patterns of P1 in the high altitude landraces could be attributed to trans- or cis-acting elements. 

Conclusions: Together, our results demonstrate that, although differences in cis-acting elements exist between the different lines under study, the different patterns of P1 expression are largely a consequence of effects in trans."

The pre-Columbian spread of maize from its center of origin in tropical Southern Mexico to the higher latitudes of the Americas required postdomestication selection for adaptation to longer day lengths. Flowering time of teosinte and tropical maize is delayed under long day lengths, whereas temperate maize evolved a reduced sensitivity to photoperiod. We measured flowering time of the maize nested association and diverse association mapping panels in the field under both short and long day lengths, and of a maize-teosinte mapping population under long day lengths. Flowering time in maize is a complex trait affected by many genes and the environment. Photoperiod response is one component of flowering time involving a subset of flowering time genes whose effects are strongly influenced by day length. Genome-wide association and targeted high-resolution linkage mapping identified ZmCCT, a homologue of the rice photoperiod response regulator Ghd7, as the most important gene affecting photoperiod response in maize. Under long day lengths ZmCCT alleles from diverse teosintes are consistently expressed at higher levels and confer later flowering than temperate maize alleles. Many maize inbred lines, including some adapted to tropical regions, carry ZmCCT alleles with no sensitivity to day length. Indigenous farmers of the Americas were remarkably successful at selecting on genetic variation at key genes affecting the photoperiod response to create maize varieties adapted to vastly diverse environments despite the hindrance of the geographic axis of the Americas and the complex genetic control of flowering time."
22772589,kernel development,A transposable element insertion within ZmGE2 gene is associated with increase in embryo to endosperm ratio in maize.,"Most of the maize kernel oil is located in the embryo while the majority of starch is located in the endosperm. Maize kernel composition and value are affected significantly by the ratio of the embryo size to the endosperm size; however, the genetic regulation of embryo to endosperm ratio (EER) in maize is unknown. Here we identified ZmGE2 gene, which encodes a cytochrome p450 protein, as a gene associated with EER variation in maize. We first expressed rice Giant Embryo (GE) gene driven by oleosin promoter in maize and detected a 23.2 % reduction in EER in transgenic seeds, demonstrating the existence of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for EER determination in rice and maize. We next identified maize GE2, a homolog of rice GE sharing 70 % identity in amino sequence, as a candidate based on the similar expression pattern and co-localization with a previously detected QTL for EER. Followed by linkage and association mapping, a 247-bp transposable element (TE) insertion in 3'-untranslated region of ZmGE2 gene was identified to be associated with increase in EER and kernel oil content. Expression level of the favorable ZmGE2 allele containing the 247-bp TE insertion was strongly reduced. In addition, the 247-bp TE insertion site was a selection target during the artificial long-term selection for the high EER trait in a high oil population. This is the first report that demonstrates an association of ZmGE2 with EER variation in maize and identifies ZmGE2 gene as a promising target for manipulation of EER and grain composition by either transgenic approach or molecular breeding in maize."
23222653,hypersensitive response like lesion formation  Olukolu 2013,A connected set of genes associated with programmed cell death implicated in controlling the hypersensitive response in maize,"Rp1-D21 is a maize auto-active resistance gene conferring a spontaneous hypersensitive defense response (HR) of variable severity depending on genetic background. We report an association mapping strategy based on the Mutant Assisted Gene Identification and Characterization (MAGIC) approach to identify naturally-occurring allelic variants associated with phenotypic variation in HR. Each member of a collection of 231 diverse inbred lines of maize constituting a high-resolution association mapping panel were crossed to a parental stock heterozygous for Rp1-D21 and the segregating F1 generation testcrosses were evaluated for phenotypes associated with lesion severity for two years at two locations. A genome-wide scan for associations with HR was conducted with 47,445 SNPs using a linear mixed model that controlled for spurious associations due to population structure. Since the ability to identify candidate genes and the resolution of association mapping are highly influenced by linkage disequilibrium (LD), we examined the extent of genome-wide LD. On average marker pairs separated by more than 10 kbp had an r2 value of less than 0.1. Genomic regions surrounding SNPs significantly associated with HR traits were locally saturated with additional SNP markers in order to establish local LD structure and precisely identify candidate genes. Six significantly associated SNPs at five loci were detected. At each locus, the associated SNP was located within or immediately adjacent to candidate causative genes predicted to play significant roles in the control of programmed cell death and especially in ubiquitin pathway-related genes.

23377180,kernel number per ear; kernel row number,Quantitative variation in maize kernel row number is controlled by the FASCIATED EAR2 locus,"Domestication of cereal crops, such as maize, wheat and rice, had a profound influence on agriculture and the establishment of human civilizations. One major improvement was an increase in seed number per inflorescence, which enhanced yield and simplified harvesting and storage. The ancestor of maize, teosinte, makes 2 rows of kernels, and modern varieties make ~8-20 rows. Kernel rows are initiated by the inflorescence shoot meristem, and shoot meristem size is controlled by a feedback loop involving the CLAVATA signaling proteins and the WUSCHEL transcription factor. We present a hypothesis that variation in inflorescence meristem size affects kernel row number (KRN), with the potential to increase yield. We also show that variation in the CLAVATA receptor-like protein FASCIATED EAR2 leads to increased inflorescence meristem size and KRN. These findings indicate that modulation of fundamental stem cell proliferation control pathways has the potential to enhance crop yields."
23474695,response to maize rough dwarf virus,Identification of promoter motifs regulating ZmeIF4E expression level involved in maize rough dwarf disease resistance in maize (Zea Mays L.).,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD, a viral disease) results in significant grain yield losses, while genetic basis of which is largely unknown. Based on comparative genomics, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) was considered as a candidate gene for MRDD resistance, validation of which will help to understand the possible genetic mechanism of this disease. ZmeIF4E (orthologs of eIF4E gene in maize) encodes a protein of 218 amino acids, harboring five exons and no variation in the cDNA sequence is identified between the resistant inbred line, X178 and susceptible one, Ye478. ZmeIF4E expression was different in the two lines plants treated with three plant hormones, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonates at V3 developmental stage, suggesting that ZmeIF4E is more likely to be involved in the regulation of defense gene expression and induction of local and systemic resistance. Moreover, four cis-acting elements related to plant defense responses, including DOFCOREZM, EECCRCAH1, GT1GAMSCAM4, and GT1CONSENSUS were detected in ZmeIF4E promoter for harboring sequence variation in the two lines. Association analysis with 163 inbred lines revealed that one SNP in EECCRCAH1 is significantly associated with CSI of MRDD in two environments, which explained 3.33 and 9.04 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. Meanwhile, one SNP in GT-1 motif was found to affect MRDD resistance only in one of the two environments, which explained 5.17 % of phenotypic variation. Collectively, regulatory motifs respectively harboring the two significant SNPs in ZmeIF4E promoter could be involved in the defense process of maize after viral infection. These results contribute to understand maize defense mechanisms against maize rough dwarf virus."
23840585,rind puncture resistance PANZEA; rind puncture resistance PANZEA,The genetic architecture of maize stalk strength,"Stalk strength is an important trait in maize (Zea mays L.). Strong stalks reduce lodging and maximize harvestable yield. Studies show rind penetrometer resistance (RPR), or the force required to pierce a stalk rind with a spike, is a valid approximation of strength. We measured RPR across 4,692 recombinant inbreds (RILs) comprising the maize nested association mapping (NAM) panel derived from crosses of diverse inbreds to the inbred, B73. An intermated B73xMo17 family (IBM) of 196 RILs and a panel of 2,453 diverse inbreds from the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) were also evaluated. We measured RPR in three environments. Family-nested QTL were identified by joint-linkage mapping in the NAM panel. We also performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) in each panel. Broad sense heritability computed on a line means basis was low for RPR. Only 8 of 26 families had a heritability above 0.20. The NCRPIS diversity panel had a heritability of 0.54. Across NAM and IBM families, 18 family-nested QTL and 141 significant GWAS associations were identified for RPR. Numerous weak associations were also found in the NCRPIS diversity panel. However, few were linked to loci involved in phenylpropanoid and cellulose synthesis or vegetative phase transition. Using an identity-by-state (IBS) relationship matrix estimated from 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and RPR measures from 20% of the NAM panel, genomic prediction by GBLUP explained 64&plusmn;2% of variation in the remaining RILs. In the NCRPIS diversity panel, an IBS matrix estimated from 681,257 SNPs and RPR measures from 20% of the panel explained 33&plusmn;3% of variation in the remaining inbreds. These results indicate the high genetic complexity of stalk strength and the potential for genomic prediction to hasten its improvement."
23880865,response to abscisic acid,"Characterization of a gene encoding clathrin heavy chain in maize up-regulated by salicylic acid, abscisic acid and high boron supply.","Clathrin, a three-legged triskelion composed of three clathrin heavy chains (CHCs) and three light chains (CLCs), plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in eukaryotic cells. In this study, the genes ZmCHC1 and ZmCHC2 encoding clathrin heavy chain in maize were cloned and characterized for the first time in monocots. ZmCHC1 encodes a 1693-amino acid-protein including 29 exons and 28 introns, and ZmCHC2 encodes a 1746-amino acid-protein including 28 exons and 27 introns. The high similarities of gene structure, protein sequences and 3D models among ZmCHC1, and Arabidopsis AtCHC1 and AtCHC2 suggest their similar functions in CME. ZmCHC1 gene is predominantly expressed in maize roots instead of ubiquitous expression of ZmCHC2. Consistent with a typical predicted salicylic acid (SA)-responsive element and four predicted ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in the promoter sequence of ZmCHC1, the expression of ZmCHC1 instead of ZmCHC2 in maize roots is significantly up-regulated by SA or ABA, suggesting that ZmCHC1 gene may be involved in the SA signaling pathway in maize defense responses. The expressions of ZmCHC1 and ZmCHC2 genes in maize are down-regulated by azide or cold treatment, further revealing the energy requirement of CME and suggesting that CME in plants is sensitive to low temperatures."
23894539,salinity tolerance; drought response,The maize AAA-type protein SKD1 confers enhanced salt and drought stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco by interacting with Lyst-interacting protein 5.,"ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA) proteins are important regulators involved in diverse cellular functions. To date, the molecular mechanisms of AAA proteins involved in response to salt and drought stresses in plants are largely unknown. In this study, a putative SKD1 (suppressor of K(+) transport growth defect 1) ortholog from Zea mays (ZmSKD1), which encodes a putative AAA protein, was isolated. The transcript levels of ZmSKD1 were higher in aerial tissues and were markedly up-regulated by salt or drought stress. Over-expression of ZmSKD1 in tobacco plants enhanced their tolerances not only to salt but to drought. Moreover, reactive oxygen species accumulations in ZmSKD1 transgenic lines were relative less than those in wild-type plants during salt or PEG-induced water stress. The interaction between ZmSKD1 and NtLIP5 (Lyst-Interacting Protein 5 homolog from Nicotiana tabacum) was confirmed by both yeast two-hybrid and immuno-precipitation assays; moreover, the α-helix-rich domain in the C-terminus of ZmSKD1 was identified to be required for its interaction with NtLIP5 using truncation mutations. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ZmSKD1could be involved in salt and drought stress responses and its over-expression enhances salt or drought stress tolerance possibly through interacting with LIP5 in tobacco. This study may facilitate our understandings of the biological roles of SKD1-mediated ESCRT pathway under stress conditions in higher plants and accelerate genetic improvement of crop plants tolerant to environmental stresses."
23898034,response to maize leaf aphid Meihls 2013,"Natural Variation in Maize Aphid Resistance Is Associated with 2,4-Dihydroxy-7-Methoxy-1,4-Benzoxazin-3-One Glucoside Methyltransferase Activity","Plants differ greatly in their susceptibility to insect herbivory, suggesting both local adaptation and resistance tradeoffs. We used maize (Zea mays) recombinant inbred lines to map a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the maize leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) susceptibility to maize Chromosome 1. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the same locus was also associated with high levels of 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (HDMBOA-Glc) and low levels of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (DIMBOA-Glc). In vitro enzyme assays with candidate genes from the region of the QTL identified three O-methyltransferases (Bx10a-c) that convert DIMBOA-Glc to HDMBOA-Glc. Variation in HDMBOA-Glc production was attributed to a natural CACTA family transposon insertion that inactivates Bx10c in maize lines with low HDMBOA-Glc accumulation. When tested with a population of 26 diverse maize inbred lines, R. maidis produced more progeny on those with high HDMBOA-Glc and low DIMBOA-Glc. Although HDMBOA-Glc was more toxic to R. maidis than DIMBOA-Glc in vitro, BX10c activity and the resulting decline of DIMBOA-Glc upon methylation to HDMBOA-Glc were associated with reduced callose deposition as an aphid defense response in vivo. Thus, a natural transposon insertion appears to mediate an ecologically relevant trade-off between the direct toxicity and defense-inducing properties of maize benzoxazinoids."
24048647,response to Fusarium ear rot,A genome-wide association study reveals genes associated with fusarium ear rot resistance in a maize core diversity panel,"Fusarium ear rot is a common disease of maize that affects food and feed quality globally. Resistance to the disease is highly quantitative, and maize breeders have difficulty incorporating polygenic resistance alleles from unadapted donor sources into elite breeding populations without having a negative impact on agronomic performance. Identification of specific allele variants contributing to improved resistance may be useful to breeders by allowing selection of resistance alleles in coupling phase linkage with favorable agronomic characteristics. We report the results of a genome-wide association study to detect allele variants associated with increased resistance to Fusarium ear rot in a maize core diversity panel of 267 inbred lines evaluated in two sets of environments. We performed association tests with 47,445 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) while controlling for background genomic relationships with a mixed model and identified three marker loci significantly associated with disease resistance in at least one subset of environments. Each associated SNP locus had relatively small additive effects on disease resistance (+/-1.1% on a 0-100% scale), but nevertheless were associated with 3 to 12% of the genotypic variation within or across environment subsets. Two of three identified SNPs colocalized with genes that have been implicated with programmed cell death. An analysis of associated allele frequencies within the major maize subpopulations revealed enrichment for resistance alleles in the tropical/subtropical and popcorn subpopulations compared with other temperate breeding pools."
24086146,drought response,Genome-Wide Analysis of ZmDREB Genes and Their Association with Natural Variation in Drought Tolerance at Seedling Stage of Zea mays L,"The worldwide production of maize (Zea mays L.) is frequently impacted by water scarcity and as a result, increased drought tolerance is a priority target in maize breeding programs. While DREB transcription factors have been demonstrated to play a central role in desiccation tolerance, whether or not natural sequence variations in these genes are associated with the phenotypic variability of this trait is largely unknown. In the present study, eighteen ZmDREB genes present in the maize B73 genome were cloned and systematically analyzed to determine their phylogenetic relationship, synteny with rice, maize and sorghum genomes; pattern of drought-responsive gene expression, and protein transactivation activity. Importantly, the association between the nucleic acid variation of each ZmDREB gene with drought tolerance was evaluated using a diverse population of maize consisting of 368 varieties from tropical and temperate regions. A significant association between the genetic variation of ZmDREB2.7 and drought tolerance at seedling stage was identified. Further analysis found that the DNA polymorphisms in the promoter region of ZmDREB2.7, but not the protein coding region itself, was associated with different levels of drought tolerance among maize varieties, likely due to distinct patterns of gene expression in response to drought stress. In vitro, protein-DNA binding assay demonstrated that ZmDREB2.7 protein could specifically interact with the target DNA sequences. The transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ZmDREB2.7 displayed enhanced tolerance to drought stress. Moreover, a favorable allele of ZmDREB2.7, identified in the drought-tolerant maize varieties, was effective in imparting plant tolerance to drought stress. Based upon these findings, we conclude that natural variation in the promoter of ZmDREB2.7 contributes to maize drought tolerance, and that the gene and its favorable allele may be an important genetic resource for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in maize."
24089449,anthesis photoperiod response; silking photoperiod response,CACTA-like transposable element in ZmCCT attenuated photoperiod sensitivity and accelerated the postdomestication spread of maize,"The postdomestication adaptation of maize to longer days required reduced photoperiod sensitivity to optimize flowering time. We performed a genome-wide association study and confirmed that ZmCCT, encoding a CCT domain-containing protein, is associated with the photoperiod response. In early-flowering maize we detected a CACTA-like transposable element (TE) within the ZmCCT promoter that dramatically reduced flowering time. TE insertion likely occurred after domestication and was selected as maize adapted to temperate zones. This process resulted in a strong selective sweep within the TE-related block of linkage disequilibrium. Functional validations indicated that the TE represses ZmCCT expression to reduce photoperiod sensitivity, thus accelerating maize spread to long-day environments."
24178260,"sucrose, leaf below flag leaf; fructose, leaf below flag leaf; glucose, leaf below flag leaf",Inorganic pyrophosphate content and metabolites in potato and tobacco plants expressing E. coli pyrophosphatase in their cytosol,"Metabolite levels and carbohydrates were investigated in the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and leaves and tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants which had been transformed with pyrophosphatase from Escherichia coli. In tobacco the leaves contained two- to threefold less pyrophosphate than controls and showed a large increase in UDP-glucose, relative to hexose phosphate. There was a large accumulation of sucrose, hexoses and starch, but the soluble sugars increased more than starch. Growth of the stem and roots was inhibited and starch, sucrose and hexoses accumulated. In potato, the leaves contained two- to threefold less pyrophosphate and an increased UDP-glucose/ hexose-phosphate ratio. Sucrose increased and starch decreased. The plants produced a larger number of smaller tubers which contained more sucrose and less starch. The tubers contained threefold higher UDP-glucose, threefold lower hexose-phosphates, glycerate-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and up to sixfold more fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase than the wild-type tubers. It is concluded that removal of pyrophosphate from the cytosol inhibits plant growth. It is discussed how these results provide evidence that sucrose mobilisation via sucrose synthase provides one key site at which pyrophosphate is needed for plant growth, but is certainly not the only site at which pyrophosphate plays a crucial role.

To improve our understanding of genotypical variability in the tolerance to Fe deficiency-induced chlorosis, the objectives of this study were to (i) determine the natural genetic variation of traits related to Fe homeostasis in the maize intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) population, (ii) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits, and (iii) to analyze expression levels of genes known to be involved in Fe homeostasis as well as of candidate genes obtained from the QTL analysis. <p> RESULTS: In hydroponically-grown maize, a total of 47 and 39 QTLs were detected for the traits recorded under limited and adequate supply of Fe, respectively.<p> CONCLUSIONS: From the QTL results, we were able to identify new putative candidate genes involved in Fe homeostasis under a deficient or adequate Fe nutritional status, like Ferredoxin class gene, putative ferredoxin PETF, metal tolerance protein MTP4, and MTP8. Furthermore, our expression analysis of candidate genes suggested the importance of trans-acting regulation for 2'-deoxymugineic acid synthase 1 (DMAS1), nicotianamine synthase (NAS3, NAS1), formate dehydrogenase 1 (FDH1), methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (IDI2), aspartate/tyrosine/aromatic aminotransferase (IDI4), and methylthioribose kinase (MTK)."
24473076,response to Ustilago maydis,A secreted Ustilago maydis effector promotes virulence by targeting anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize,"The biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease in maize with characteristic tumor formation and anthocyanin induction. Here, we show that anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by the virulence promoting secreted effector protein Tin2. Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin-proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize brown midrib mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to U. maydis infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01355.001."

Given a pedigree or estimates of the genomic identity-by-state among related plants, height is also accurately predictable. But, mapping alleles explaining natural variation in maize height remains a formidable challenge. To address this challenge, we measured the plant height, ear height, flowering time, and node counts of plants grown in over 64,500 plots across 13 environments. These plots contained over 7,300 inbreds representing most publically available maize inbreds in the U.S. and families of the maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) panel. Joint-linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), fine mapping in near isogenic lines (NILs), genome wide association studies (GWAS), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) were performed. The heritability of maize height was estimated to be over 90%. Mapping NAM family-nested QTL revealed the largest explained 2.1¿¿0.9% of height variation. The effects of two tropical alleles at this QTL were independently validated by fine mapping in NIL families. Several significant associations found by GWAS co-localized with established height loci including brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf1, dwarf plant1, and semi-dwarf2. GBLUP explained over 80% of height variation in the panels and outperformed bootstrap aggregation of family-nested QTL models in evaluations of prediction accuracy. These results revealed maize height was under strong genetic control and had a highly polygenic genetic architecture. They also showed multiple models of genetic architecture differing in polygenicity and effect sizes can plausibly explain a population's variation in maize height; but may vary in predictive efficacy."
24607887,days to flowering,A MITE transposon insertion is associated with differential methylation at the maize flowering time QTL vgt1,"One of the major quantitative trait loci for flowering time in maize, the Vegetative to generative transition 1 (Vgt1) locus, corresponds to an upstream (70 kb) noncoding regulatory element of ZmRap2.7, a repressor of flowering. At Vgt1, a miniature transposon (MITE) insertion into a conserved noncoding sequence was previously found to be highly associated with early flowering in independent studies. Because cytosine methylation is known to be associated with transposons and to influence gene expression, we aimed to investigate how DNA methylation patterns in wild-type and mutant Vgt1 correlate with ZmRap2.7 expression. The methylation state at Vgt1 was assayed in leaf samples of maize inbred and F1 hybrid samples, and at the syntenic region in sorghum. The Vgt1-linked conserved noncoding sequence was very scarcely methylated both in maize and sorghum. However, in the early maize Vgt1 allele, the region immediately flanking the highly methylated MITE insertion was significantly more methylated and showed features of methylation spreading. Allele-specific expression assays revealed that the presence of the MITE and its heavy methylation appear to be linked to altered ZmRap2.7 transcription. Although not providing proof of causative connection, our results associate transposon-linked differential methylation with allelic state and gene expression at a major flowering time quantitative trait locus in maize.

24725255,animal response,Emission of herbivore elicitor-induced sesquiterpenes is regulated by stomatal aperture in maize (Zea mays) seedlings.,"Maize seedlings emit sesquiterpenes during the day in response to insect herbivory. Parasitoids and predators use induced volatile blends to find their hosts or prey. To investigate the diurnal regulation of biosynthesis and emission of induced sesquiterpenes, we applied linolenoyl-L-glutamine (LG) to maize seedlings in the morning or evening using a cut-stem assay and tracked farnesene emission, in planta accumulation, as well as transcript levels of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase 3 (ZmFPPS3) and terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10) throughout the following day. Independent of time of day of LG treatment, maximum transcript levels of ZmFPPS3 and ZmTPS10 occurred within 3-4 h after elicitor application. The similarity between the patterns of farnesene emission and in planta accumulation in light-exposed seedlings in both time courses suggested unobstructed emission in the light. After evening induction, farnesene biosynthesis increased dramatically during early morning hours. Contrary to light-exposed seedlings dark-kept seedlings retained the majority of the synthesized farnesene. Two treatments to reduce stomatal aperture, dark exposure at midday, and abscisic acid treatment before daybreak, resulted in significantly reduced amounts of emitted and significantly increased amounts of in planta accumulating farnesene. Our results suggest that stomata not only play an important role in gas exchange for primary metabolism but also for indirect plant defences."
24817160,drought response; response to salt,"A novel maize homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) I gene, Zmhdz10, positively regulates drought and salt tolerance in both rice and Arabidopsis.","Increasing evidence suggests that homeodomain-leucine zipper I (HD-Zip) I transcription factors play important roles in abiotic stress responses, but no HD-Zip I proteins have been reported in maize. Here, a drought-induced HD-Zip I gene, Zmhdz10, was isolated from maize and characterized for its role in stress responses. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of Zmhdz10 was also induced by salt stress and ABA. Transient expression of Zmhdz10-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in onion cells showed a nuclear localization of Zmhdz10. Yeast hybrid assays demonstrated that Zmhdz10 has transactivation and DNA-binding activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of Zmhdz10 in rice led to enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses and increased sensitivity to ABA. Moreover, Zmhdz10 transgenic plants had lower relative electrolyte leakage (REL), lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased proline content relative to wild-type plants under stress conditions, which may contribute to enhanced stress tolerance. Zmhdz10 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses that was concomitant with altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes, including Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1), Responsive to dehydration 22 (RD22), Responsive to dehydration 29B (RD29B) and ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1). Taken together, these results suggest that Zmhdz10 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can positively regulate drought and salt tolerance in plants through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway."
25120948,seed viability,Peroxidase activity in scutella of maize in association with anatomical changes during germination and grain storage.,"The embryo of the maize grain (Zea mays L.) is separated from the starchy endosperm by a fibrous structure, which is called the fibrous layer (FL). Using histochemical staining, it was determined that the FL is composed of collapsed cellular layers that contain phenols, neutral lipids, and 1,3-β-glucan. Due to its composition, the FL prevents free diffusion and separates the embryo from the endosperm during germination. Twenty-four hours after imbibition, the scutellum epidermis initiated a series of asynchronous spatial modifications, including cell growth, the perforation of cell walls, increased peroxidase activity in the apoplastic space, and elevated levels of superoxide, phenols, and other components that interact with the fibrous layer, enabling its transformation in addition to the free flow between compartments. During storage at high relative humidity levels, which leads to fast or slow deterioration depending on the temperature, the activity of phenol peroxidase in the scutellum was associated with a loss of vigor and reduced germination capacity when compared with low temperature and low relative humidity conditions. Such deterioration is associated with alterations in autofluorescent emissions from endogenous compounds in the scutellum, indicating changes in the microenvironment or in the differential proportions of epidermal and FL components."
25122482,response to Fusarium stalk rot,"The novel monocot-specific 9-lipoxygenase, ZmLOX12, is required to mount an effective jasmonate-mediated defense against Fusarium verticillioides in maize","Fusarium verticillioides is a major limiting factor for maize production due to ear and stalk rot and the contamination of seed with the carcinogenic mycotoxin, fumonisin. While lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived oxylipins have been implicated in defense against diverse pathogens, their function in maize resistance against F. verticillioides is poorly understood. Here, we functionally characterized a novel maize 9-LOX gene, ZmLOX12. This gene is distantly related to known dicot LOXs, with closest homologs found exclusively in other monocot species. ZmLOX12 is predominantly expressed in mesocotyls where it is strongly induced in response to F. verticillioides infection. The Mutator transposon-insertional lox12-1 mutant is more susceptible to F. verticillioides colonization of mesocotyls, stalks, and kernels. The infected mutant kernels accumulate significantly greater level of mycotoxin, fumonisin. Reduced resistance to the pathogen is accompanied by reduced levels of the jasmonic acid precursor 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid-isoleucine conjugate (JA-Ile) and expression of jasmonate-biosynthetic genes. Supporting the strong defense role of jasmonates, JA-deficient opr7 opr8 double mutant displayed complete lack of immunity to F. verticillioides. Unexpectedly, the more susceptible lox12 mutant accumulated higher levels of kauralexins, suggesting that F. verticillioides is tolerant to this group of antimicrobial phytoalexins. This study demonstrates that this unique monocot-specific 9-LOX plays a key role in defense against F. verticillioides in diverse maize tissues and provides genetic evidence that JA is the major defense hormone against this pathogen."

Genetic control of the HR is hard to quantify due to its microscopic and rapid nature. Natural modifiers of the ectopic HR phenotype induced by an aberrant auto-active R-gene (Rp1-D21), were mapped in a population of 3,381 recombinant inbred lines from the maize nested association mapping population. Joint linkage analysis was conducted to identify 32 additive but no epistatic quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a linkage map based on more than 7000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of 26.5 million SNPs was conducted after adjusting for background QTL. GWA identified associated SNPs that colocalized with 44 candidate genes. Thirty-six of these genes colocalized within 23 of the 32 QTL identified by joint linkage analysis. The candidate genes included genes predicted to be in involved programmed cell death, defense response, ubiquitination, redox homeostasis, autophagy, calcium signalling, lignin biosynthesis and cell wall modification. Twelve of the candidate genes showed significant differential expression between isogenic lines differing for the presence of Rp1-D21. Low but significant correlations between HR-related traits and several previously-measured disease resistance traits suggested that the genetic control of these traits was substantially, though not entirely, independent. This study provides the first system-wide analysis of natural variation that modulates the HR response in plants."

To characterize phenotypic patterns and their genetic control, three recombinant inbred populations of maize were grown for 28 days in solid media in a greenhouse and evaluated for 21 root architectural traits, including length, number, diameter, and branching of seminal, primary and nodal roots, dry weight of embryonic and nodal systems, and diameter of the nodal root system. Significant phenotypic variation was observed for all traits. Strong correlations were observed among traits in the same root class, particularly for the length of the main root axis and the length of lateral roots. In a principal component analysis, relationships among traits differed slightly for the three families, though vectors grouped together for traits within a given root class, indicating opportunities for more efficient phenotyping. Allometric analysis showed that trajectories of growth for specific traits differ in the three populations. In total, 15 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. QTL are reported for length in multiple root classes, diameter and number of seminal roots, and dry weight of the embryonic and nodal root systems. Phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 0.44 % (number of seminal roots, NyH population) to 13.5 % (shoot dry weight, OhW population). Identification of QTL for root architectural traits may be useful for developing genotypes that are better suited to specific soil environments."
25261982,response to barley yellow dwarf virus,Genes involved in barley yellow dwarf virus resistance of maize.,"The results of our study suggest that genes involved in general resistance mechanisms of plants contribute to variation of BYDV resistance in maize. With increasing winter temperatures in Europe, Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is expected to become a prominent problem in maize cultivation. Breeding for resistance is the best strategy to control the disease and break the transmission cycle of the virus. The objectives of our study were (1) to determine genetic variation with respect to BYDV resistance in a broad germplasm set and (2) to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to genes that are involved in BYDV resistance. An association mapping population with 267 genotypes representing the world's maize gene pool was grown in the greenhouse. Plants were inoculated with BYDV-PAV using viruliferous Rhopalosiphum padi. In the association mapping population, we observed considerable genotypic variance for the trait virus extinction as measured by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and the infection rate. In a genome-wide association study, we observed three SNPs significantly [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05] associated with the virus extinction on chromosome 10 explaining together 25 % of the phenotypic variance and five SNPs for the infection rate on chromosomes 4 and 10 explaining together 33 % of the phenotypic variance. The SNPs significantly associated with BYDV resistance can be used in marker assisted selection and will accelerate the breeding process for the development of BYDV resistant maize genotypes. Furthermore, these SNPs were located within genes which were in other organisms described to play a role in general resistance mechanisms. This suggests that these genes contribute to variation of BYDV resistance in maize."

Ten root anatomical traits were measured in greenhouse-grown plants from three recombinant inbred populations of maize [intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM), Oh43 x W64a (OhW), and Ny821 x H99 (NyH)]. Traits included areas of cross section, stele, cortex, aerenchyma, and cortical cells, percentages of the cortex occupied by aerenchyma, and cortical cell file number. Significant phenotypic variation was observed for each of the traits, with maximum values typically seven to ten times greater than minimum values. Means and ranges were similar for the OhW and NyH populations for all traits, while the IBM population had lower mean values for the majority of traits, but a 50 % greater range of variation for aerenchyma area. A principal component analysis showed a similar trait structure for the three families, with clustering of area and count traits. Strong correlations were observed among area traits in the cortex, stele, and cross-section. The aerenchyma and percent living cortical area traits were independent of other traits. Six QTL were identified for four of the traits. The phenotypic variation explained by the QTL ranged from 4.7 % (root cross-sectional area, OhW population) to 12.0 % (percent living cortical area, IBM population). Genetic variation for root anatomical traits can be harnessed to increase abiotic stress tolerance and provide insights into mechanisms controlling phenotypic variation for root anatomy."
25388988,Abiotic stress response,Expression analysis of genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinases in maize provides a key link between abiotic stress signaling and plant reproduction.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in stress responses and development in plants. Maize (Zea mays), an important cereal crop, is a model plant species for molecular studies. In the last decade, several MAPKs have been identified in maize; however, their functions have not been studied extensively. Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of maize MAPK genes could provide valuable information for understanding their functions. In this study, 20 non-redundant maize MAPK genes (ZmMPKs) were identified via a genome-wide survey. Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKs from maize, rice (Oryza sativa), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) classified them into four major classes. ZmMPKs in the same class had similar domains, motifs, and genomic structures. Gene duplication investigations suggested that segmental duplications made a large contribution to the expansion of ZmMPKs. A number of cis-acting elements related to plant development and response to stress and hormones were identified in the promoter regions of ZmMPKs. Furthermore, transcript profile analysis in eight tissues and organs at various developmental stages demonstrated that most ZmMPKs were preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues and organs. The transcript abundance of most ZmMPKs changed significantly under salt, drought, cold, or abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, implying that they might participate in abiotic stress and ABA signaling. These expression analyses indicated that ZmMPKs might serve as linkers between abiotic stress signaling and plant reproduction. Our data will deepen our understanding of the complexity of the maize MAPK gene family and provide new clues to investigate their functions."

Despite the vast amount of genomic data becoming available, many pressing questions remain about the nature of genetic mutations that underlie functional variation. We present the results of combining genome-wide association analysis of 41 different phenotypes in ~5,000 inbred maize lines to analyze patterns of high-resolution genetic association among of 28.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ~800,000 copy-number variants (CNVs). We show that genic and intergenic regions have opposite patterns of enrichment, minor allele frequencies, and effect sizes, implying tradeoffs among the probability that a given polymorphism will have an effect, the detectable size of that effect, and its frequency in the population. We also find that genes tagged by GWAS are enriched for regulatory functions and are ~50% more likely to have a paralog than expected by chance, indicating that gene regulation and neofunctionalization are strong drivers of phenotypic variation. These results will likely apply to many other organisms, especially ones with large and complex genomes like maize."
25475173,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; response to Bipolaris maydis,Limits on the reproducibility of marker associations with southern leaf blight resistance in the maize nested association mapping population,"BACKGROUND: A previous study reported a comprehensive quantitative trait locus (QTL) and genome wide association study (GWAS) of southern leaf blight (SLB) resistance in the maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) panel. Since that time, the genomic resources available for such analyses have improved substantially. An updated NAM genetic linkage map has a nearly six-fold greater marker density than the previous map and the combined SNPs and read-depth variants (RDVs) from maize HapMaps 1 and 2 provided 28.5 M genomic variants for association analysis, 17 fold more than HapMap 1. In addition, phenotypic values of the NAM RILs were re-estimated to account for environment-specific flowering time covariates and a small proportion of lines were dropped due to genotypic data quality problems. Comparisons of original and updated QTL and GWAS results confound the effects of linkage map density, GWAS marker density, population sample size, and phenotype estimates. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of changing each of these parameters individually and in combination to determine their relative impact on marker-trait associations in original and updated analyses.<p> RESULTS: Of the four parameters varied, map density caused the largest changes in QTL and GWAS results. The updated QTL model had better cross-validation prediction accuracy than the previous model. Whereas joint linkage QTL positions were relatively stable to input changes, the residual values derived from those QTL models (used as inputs to GWAS) were more sensitive, resulting in substantial differences between GWAS results. The updated NAM GWAS identified several candidate genes consistent with previous QTL fine-mapping results.<p> CONCLUSIONS: The highly polygenic nature of resistance to SLB complicates the identification of causal genes. Joint linkage QTL are relatively stable to perturbations of data inputs, but their resolution is generally on the order of tens or more Mbp. GWAS associations have higher resolution, but lower power due to stringent thresholds designed to minimize false positive associations, resulting in variability of detection across studies. The updated higher density linkage map improves QTL estimation and, along with a much denser SNP HapMap, greatly increases the likelihood of detecting SNPs in linkage with causal variants. We recommend use of the updated genetic resources and results but emphasize the limited repeatability of small-effect associations."
25532107,foliar senescence,Transcriptional analyses of natural leaf senescence in maize.,"Leaf senescence is an important biological process that contributes to grain yield in crops. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying natural leaf senescence, we harvested three different developmental ear leaves of maize, mature leaves (ML), early senescent leaves (ESL), and later senescent leaves (LSL), and analyzed transcriptional changes using RNA-sequencing. Three sets of data, ESL vs. ML, LSL vs. ML, and LSL vs. ESL, were compared, respectively. In total, 4,552 genes were identified as differentially expressed. Functional classification placed these genes into 18 categories including protein metabolism, transporters, and signal transduction. At the early stage of leaf senescence, genes involved in aromatic amino acids (AAAs) biosynthetic process and transport, cellular polysaccharide biosynthetic process, and the cell wall macromolecule catabolic process, were up-regulated. Whereas, genes involved in amino acid metabolism, transport, apoptosis, and response to stimulus were up-regulated at the late stage of leaf senescence. Further analyses reveals that the transport-related genes at the early stage of leaf senescence potentially take part in enzyme and amino acid transport and the genes upregulated at the late stage are involved in sugar transport, indicating nutrient recycling mainly takes place at the late stage of leaf senescence. Comparison between the data of natural leaf senescence in this study and previously reported data for Arabidopsis implies that the mechanisms of leaf senescence in maize are basically similar to those in Arabidopsis. A comparison of natural and induced leaf senescence in maize was performed. Athough many basic biological processes involved in senescence occur in both types of leaf senescence, 78.07% of differentially expressed genes in natural leaf senescence were not identifiable in induced leaf senescence, suggesting that differences in gene regulatory network may exist between these two leaf senescence programs. Thus, this study provides important information for understanding the mechanism of leaf senescence in maize."
25647576,response to Colletotrichum graminicola,A sorghum MYB transcription factor induces 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and enhances resistance against leaf blights in maize.,"Sorghum responds to the ingress of the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum sublineolum through the biosynthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins at the site of primary infection. Biosynthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum requires a MYB transcription factor encoded by yellow seed1 (y1), an orthologue of the maize gene pericarp color1 (p1). Maize lines with a functional p1 and flavonoid structural genes do not produce foliar 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in response to fungal ingress. To perform a comparative metabolic analysis of sorghum and maize 3-deoxyanthocyanidin biosynthetic pathways, we developed transgenic maize lines expressing the sorghum y1 gene. In maize, the y1 transgene phenocopied p1-regulated pigment accumulation in the pericarp and cob glumes. LC-MS profiling of fungus-challenged Y1-maize leaves showed induction of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, specifically luteolinidin. Y1-maize plants also induced constitutive and higher levels of flavonoids in leaves. In response to Colletotrichum graminicola, Y1-maize showed a resistance response."

In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify SNPs associated with resistance to Mediterranean corn borer in a maize diversity panel using a set of more than 240,000 SNPs.ResultsTwenty five SNPs were significantly associated with three resistance traits: 10 were significantly associated with tunnel length, 4 with stem damage, and 11 with kernel resistance. Allelic variation at each significant SNP was associated with from 6 to 9% of the phenotypic variance. A set of genes containing or physically close to these SNPs are proposed as candidate genes for borer resistance, supported by their involvement in plant defense-related mechanisms in previously published evidence. The linkage disequilibrium decayed (r 2&iquest;&lt;&iquest;0.10) rapidly within short distance, suggesting high resolution of GWAS associations.ConclusionsMost of the candidate genes found in this study are part of signaling pathways, others act as regulator of expression under biotic stress condition, and a few genes are encoding enzymes with antibiotic effect against insects such as the cystatin1 gene and the defensin proteins. These findings contribute to the understanding the complex relationship between plant-insect interactions."
25764179,response to Cercospora zeae-maydis Benson 2015; anthesis date; inter-vein distance ; inter-vein distance ,Resistance to gray leaf spot of maize: Genetic architecture and mechanisms elucidated through nested association mapping and near-isogenic line analysis,"Gray leaf spot (GLS), caused by Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina, is one of the most important diseases of maize worldwide. The pathogen has a necrotrophic lifestyle and no major genes are known for GLS. Quantitative resistance, although poorly understood, is important for GLS management. We used genetic mapping to refine understanding of the genetic architecture of GLS resistance and to develop hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying quantitative disease resistance (QDR) loci. Nested association mapping (NAM) was used to identify 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for QDR to GLS, including seven novel QTL, each of which demonstrated allelic series with significant effects above and below the magnitude of the B73 reference allele. Alleles at three QTL, qGLS1.04, qGLS2.09, and qGLS4.05, conferred disease reductions of greater than 10%. Interactions between loci were detected for three pairs of loci, including an interaction between iqGLS4.05 and qGLS7.03. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed to confirm and fine-map three of the 16 QTL, and to develop hypotheses regarding mechanisms of resistance. qGLS1.04 was fine-mapped from an interval of 27.0 Mb to two intervals of 6.5 Mb and 5.2 Mb, consistent with the hypothesis that multiple genes underlie highly significant QTL identified by NAM. qGLS2.09, which was also associated with maturity (days to anthesis) and with resistance to southern leaf blight, was narrowed to a 4-Mb interval. The distance between major leaf veins was strongly associated with resistance to GLS at qGLS4.05. NILs for qGLS1.04 were treated with the C. zeae-maydis toxin cercosporin to test the role of host-specific toxin in QDR. Cercosporin exposure increased expression of a putative flavin-monooxygenase (FMO) gene, a candidate detoxification-related gene underlying qGLS1.04. This integrated approach to confirming QTL and characterizing the potential underlying mechanisms advances the understanding of QDR and will facilitate the development of resistant varieties."
25918116,metabolites PC2 Wallace 2014; metabolites PC1 Wallace 2014,Genome-wide association of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the maize nested association mapping population,"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism are critical to plant growth and development and are at the basis of crop yield and adaptation. We performed high-throughput metabolite analyses on over 12,000 samples from the maize Nested Association Mapping population to identify genetic variation in C and N metabolism in maize (Zea mays subsp. mays). All samples were grown in the same field and used to identify natural variation controlling the levels of twelve key C and N metabolites, namely chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, fructose, fumarate, glucose, glutamate, malate, nitrate, starch, sucrose, total amino acids, and total protein, along with the first two principal components derived from them. Our GWAS results frequently identified hits with single-gene resolution. In addition to expected genes such as invertases, natural variation was identified in key C4 metabolism genes including carbonic anhydrases and a malate transporter. Unlike several prior maize studies, extensive pleiotropy was found for C and N metabolites. This integration of field-derived metabolite data with powerful mapping and genomics resources allows for dissection of key metabolic pathways, providing avenues for future genetic improvement."
26049736,days to flowering,Dearth of polymorphism associated with a sustained response to selection for flowering time in maize,"BACKGROUND: Long term selection experiments bring unique insights on the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and their evolvability. Indeed, they are utilized to (i) monitor changes in allele frequencies and assess the effects of genomic regions involved traits determinism; (ii) evaluate the role of standing variation versus new mutations during adaptation; (iii) investigate the contribution of non allelic interactions. Here we describe genetic and phenotypic evolution of two independent Divergent Selection Experiments (DSEs) for flowering time conducted during 16 years from two early maize inbred lines.<p> RESULTS: Our experimental design uses selfing as the mating system and small population sizes, so that two independent families evolved within each population, Late and Early. Observed patterns are strikingly similar between the two DSEs. We observed a significant response to selection in both directions during the first 7 generations of selection. Within Early families, the response is linear through 16 generations, consistent with the maintenance of genetic variance. Within Late families and despite maintenance of significant genetic variation across 17 generations, the response to selection reached a plateau after 7 generations. This plateau is likely caused by physiological limits. Residual heterozygosity in the initial inbreds can partly explain the observed responses as evidenced by 42 markers derived from both Methyl-Sensitive Amplification- and Amplified Fragment Length- Polymorphisms. Among the 42, a subset of 13 markers most of which are in high linkage disequilibrium, display a strong association with flowering time variation. Their fast fixation throughout DSEs' pedigrees results in strong genetic differentiation between populations and families.<p> CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a paradox between the sustainability of the response to selection and the associated dearth of polymorphisms. Among other hypotheses, we discuss the maintenance of heritable variation by few mutations with strong epistatic interactions whose effects are modified by continuous changes of the genetic background through time."
26136266,response to nitrogen,"Asymmetric transcriptomic signatures between the cob and florets in the maize ear under optimal- and low-nitrogen conditions at silking, and functional characterization of amino acid transporters ZmAAP4 and ZmVAAT3.","Coordinated functioning of the cob and florets of the maize ear confers grain yield. The cob is critical for carbon partitioning and assimilated nitrogen (N) supply for grain development. However, molecular recognition of the cob and peripheral florets, characterization of genes mediating translocation of N assimilates, and responses of these two tissues to low N (LN) remain elusive. Transcriptional profiling of the ear of a maize hybrid at silking in the field revealed 1864 differentially expressed genes between the cob and florets, with 1314 genes up-regulated in the cob and 550 genes up-regulated in florets. The cob was characterized by striking enrichment of genes that are involved in carbon/N transport and metabolism, consistent with the physiological role of the cob in carbon/N storage and transfer during ear development. The florets were characterized by enrichment of hormone signalling components and development related genes. We next examined the response of the cob and florets to LN stress. LN caused differential expression of 588 genes in the cob and only 195 genes in the florets, indicating that the cob dominated the response of the ear to LN at the transcriptional level. LN caused comprehensive alterations such as carbon/N metabolism or partitioning, hormone signalling and protein phosphorylation in terms of gene expression in the cob and/or florets. Fourteen genes responsive specifically to LN provided potential molecular markers for N-efficient maize breeding. We further functionally characterized two newly identified broad-spectrum amino acid transporters, ZmAAP4 and ZmVAAT3, that showed distinct expression patterns in the cob and florets and potentially important roles in amino-N mobilization in the ear. While both proteins could transport various amino acids into yeast or Arabidopsis cells, ZmAAP4 appeared to have higher efficiencies than ZmVAAT3 in transporting seven out of 22 examined amino acids."
26220224,pollen shedding degree; anther exsertion,"Multiple loci not only Rf3 involved in the restoration ability of pollen fertility, anther exsertion and pollen shedding to S type cytoplasmic male sterile in maize","Thirty loci for fertility restoration of pollen fertility, anther exsertion and pollen shedding to maize CMS-S were identified by GWAS. S type cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS-S) is the main type of CMS in maize; poor understanding of the genetic architecture of fertility restoration to CMS-S is one of the reasons to impede its utility in hybrid breeding. In this study, genome-wide identification of genetic loci for fertility restoration ability to CMS-S was firstly conducted with a set of testcrossing association mapping panel in three environments. A total of 19, 3 and 8 significant loci (P < 1.8 x 10-6, &#945;  = 1) for pollen fertility, anther exsertion and pollen shedding were identified, respectively, and individual locus explained up to 28.26 % of phenotypic variation. Of them, only Rf3, the main restorer-fertility gene of CMS-S, was identified for the three traits simultaneously. In addition, 83 candidate genes within the 100 kb extension regions of these loci were predicted. These results revealed that besides Rf3 multiple genetic loci and mechanisms are involved in the fertility restoration ability to CMS-S. Results in this study would provide important information for understanding the genetic architecture of fertility restoration to CMS-S in maize."
26398628,response to Gibberella ear rot,Resistance to Fusarium verticillioides and fumonisin accumulation in maize inbred lines involves an earlier and enhanced expression of lipoxygenase (LOX) genes,"Fusarium verticillioides causes ear rot in maize and contaminates the kernels with the fumonisin mycotoxins. It is known that plant lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived oxylipins regulate defence against pathogens and that the host-pathogen lipid cross-talk influences the pathogenesis. The expression profiles of fifteen genes of the LOX pathway were studied in kernels of resistant and susceptible maize lines, grown in field condition, at 3, 7 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi) with F. verticillioides. Plant defence responses were correlated with the pathogen growth, the expression profiles of fungal FUM genes for fumonisin biosynthesis and fumonisin content in the kernels. The resistant genotype limited fungal growth and fumonisin accumulation between 7 and 14 dpi. Pathogen growth became exponential in the susceptible line after 7 dpi, in correspondence with massive transcription of FUM genes and fumonisins augmented exponentially at 14 dpi. LOX pathway genes resulted strongly induced after pathogen inoculation in the resistant line at 3 and 7 dpi, whilst in the susceptible line the induction was reduced or delayed at 14 dpi. In addition, all genes resulted overexpressed before infection in kernels of the resistant genotype already at 3 dpi. The results suggest that resistance in maize may depend on an earlier activation of LOX genes and genes for jasmonic acid biosynthesis."
26463995,drought response,Extensive tissue-specific transcriptomic plasticity in maize primary roots upon water deficit.,"Water deficit is the most important environmental constraint severely limiting global crop growth and productivity. This study investigated early transcriptome changes in maize (Zea mays L.) primary root tissues in response to moderate water deficit conditions by RNA-Sequencing. Differential gene expression analyses revealed a high degree of plasticity of the water deficit response. The activity status of genes (active/inactive) was determined by a Bayesian hierarchical model. In total, 70% of expressed genes were constitutively active in all tissues. In contrast, <3% (50 genes) of water deficit-responsive genes (1915) were consistently regulated in all tissues, while >75% (1501 genes) were specifically regulated in a single root tissue. Water deficit-responsive genes were most numerous in the cortex of the mature root zone and in the elongation zone. The most prominent functional categories among differentially expressed genes in all tissues were 'transcriptional regulation' and 'hormone metabolism', indicating global reprogramming of cellular metabolism as an adaptation to water deficit. Additionally, the most significant transcriptomic changes in the root tip were associated with cell wall reorganization, leading to continued root growth despite water deficit conditions. This study provides insight into tissue-specific water deficit responses and will be a resource for future genetic analyses and breeding strategies to develop more drought-tolerant maize cultivars."
26473199,drought response,Expression of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase in maize ears improves yield in well-watered and drought conditions,"Maize, the highest-yielding cereal crop worldwide, is particularly susceptible to drought during its 2- to 3-week flowering period. Many genetic engineering strategies for drought tolerance impinge on plant development, reduce maximum yield potential or do not translate from laboratory conditions to the field. We overexpressed a gene encoding a rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) in developing maize ears using a floral promoter. This reduced the concentration of trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a sugar signal that regulates growth and development, and increased the concentration of sucrose in ear spikelets. Overexpression of TPP increased both kernel set and harvest index. Field data at several sites and over multiple seasons showed that the engineered trait improved yields from 9% to 49% under non-drought or mild drought conditions, and from 31% to 123% under more severe drought conditions, relative to yields from nontransgenic controls."
26488483,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,Characterization of sugarcane mosaic virus Scmv1 and Scmv2 resistance regions by regional association analysis in maize,"Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) causes one of the most severe virus diseases in maize worldwide, resulting in reduced grain and forage yield in susceptible cultivars. In this study, two association panels consisting of 94 inbred lines each, from China and the U.S., were characterized for resistance to two isolates: SCMV-Seehausen and SCMV-BJ. The population structure of both association panels was analyzed using 3072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The Chinese and the U.S. panel were both subdivided into two sub-populations, the latter comprised of Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SS) lines and Non Stiff Stalk Synthetic (NSS). The relative kinships were calculated using informative 2947 SNPs with minor allele frequency &#8805; 5% and missing data &#8804; 20% for the Chinese panel and 2841 SNPs with the same characteristics were used for the U.S. panel. The Scmv1 region was genotyped using 7 single sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, and 12 SSR markers were used for the Scmv2 region in the U.S. panel, while 5 of them were used for the Chinese panel. For all traits, a MLM (Mix Linear Model) controlling both population structure and relative kinship (Q + K) was used for association analysis. Three markers Trx-1, STS-11, and STS-12 located in the Scmv1 region were strongly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained more than 16.0%, 10.6%, and 19.7% of phenotypic variation, respectively. 207FG003 located in the Scmv2 region was significantly associated (P = 0.001) with SCMV resistance, and explained around 18.5% of phenotypic variation."
26496865,"tasseling date, response to low phosphorus; silking date response to low phosphorus; anthesis date response to low phosphorus; response to low phosphorus",Analysis of genetic differentiation and genomic variation to reveal potential regions of importance during maize improvement,"Background: Exploring genetic differentiation and genomic variation is important for both the utilization of heterosis and the dissection of the genetic bases of complex traits.<p> Methods: We integrated 1857 diverse maize accessions from America, Africa, Europe and Asia to investigatetheir genetic differentiation, genomic variation using 43,252 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs),combing GWAS and linkage analysis strategy to exploring the function of relevant genetic segments.<p> Results: We uncovered many more subpopulations that recently or historically formed during the breeding process. These patterns are represented by the following lines: Mo17, GB, E28, Ye8112, HZS, Shen137, PHG39, B73, 207, A634, Oh43, Reid Yellow Dent, and the Tropical/subtropical (TS) germplasm. A total of 85 highly differentiated regions with a D EST of more than 0.2 were identified between the TS and temperate subpopulations. These regions comprised 79 % of the genetic variation, and most were significantly associated with adaptive traits. For example, the region containing the SNP tag PZE.108075114 was highly differentiated, and this region was significantly associated with flowering time (FT)-related traits, as supported by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) within the interval of FT-related quantitative trait loci (QTL). This region was also closely linked to zcn8 and vgt1, which were shown to be involved in maize adaptation. Most importantly, 197 highly differentiated regions between different subpopulation pairs were located within an FT- or plant architecture-related QTL.<p> Conclusions: Here we reported that 700��1000 SNPs were necessary needed to robustly estimate the genetic differentiation of a naturally diverse panel. In addition, 13 subpopulations were observed in maize germplasm, 85 genetic regions with higher differentiation between TS and temperate maize germplasm, 197 highly differentiated regions between different subpopulation pairs, which contained some FT- related QTNs/QTLs/genes supported by GWAS and linkage analysis, and these regions were expected to play important roles in maize adaptation."
26530038,response to pink stem borer,Identification of QTL for resistance to Mediterranean corn borer in a maize tropical line to improve temperate germplasm,"BACKGROUND: A QTL mapping study for maize resistance to the Mediterranean corn borer (MCB) was performed with a RIL population derived from the cross B73xCML103. To develop commercial inbreds of maize resistant to the MCB for use in Europe, it would be useful to transfer resistance from tropical germplasm like the subtropical inbred CML103 to temperate lines. The inbred B73 was chosen as representative of the Stiff Stock heterotic group, a major heterotic group used in hybrid grown in both North American and Europe. The objectives were to study the architecture of genetic factors for resistance to MCB and to check the feasibility of using marker-assisted selection (MAS) for transferring those genetic factors.<p> RESULTS: Eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) were declared significant for resistance traits and eight QTL were located for agronomic traits. Alleles from CML103 at QTL significant for tunnel length could reduce tunnel length made for MCB in inbred B73 in more than 8 cm; favorable alleles for yield were also found in CML103 and no genetic correlation coefficient between tunnel length and yield was detected.<p> CONCLUSIONS: MAS for transferring resistance genes to corn borer attack from CML103 to B73 could be successful based on cross validation results and a negative effect on yield would not be expected."
26905724,cytoplasmic male sterility,Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in hybrid breeding in field crops.,"A comprehensive understanding of CMS/Rf system enabled by modern omics tools and technologies considerably improves our ability to harness hybrid technology for enhancing the productivity of field crops. Harnessing hybrid vigor or heterosis is a promising approach to tackle the current challenge of sustaining enhanced yield gains of field crops. In the context, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) owing to its heritable nature to manifest non-functional male gametophyte remains a cost-effective system to promote efficient hybrid seed production. The phenomenon of CMS stems from a complex interplay between maternally-inherited (mitochondrion) and bi-parental (nucleus) genomic elements. In recent years, attempts aimed to comprehend the sterility-inducing factors (orfs) and corresponding fertility determinants (Rf) in plants have greatly increased our access to candidate genomic segments and the cloned genes. To this end, novel insights obtained by applying state-of-the-art omics platforms have substantially enriched our understanding of cytoplasmic-nuclear communication. Concomitantly, molecular tools including DNA markers have been implicated in crop hybrid breeding in order to greatly expedite the progress. Here, we review the status of diverse sterility-inducing cytoplasms and associated Rf factors reported across different field crops along with exploring opportunities for integrating modern omics tools with CMS-based hybrid breeding."
26911156,stalk quality,Ploidy effect and genetic architecture exploration of stalk traits using DH and its corresponding haploid populations in maize.,"Background: Doubled haploid (DH) lines produced via in vivo haploid induction have become indispensable in maize research and practical breeding, so it is important to understand traits characteristics in DH and its corresponding haploids which derived from each DH lines. In this study, a DH population derived from Zheng58 × Chang7-2 and a haploid population, were developed, genotyped and evaluated to investigate genetic architecture of eight stalk traits, especially rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) and in vitro dry matter digestion (IVDMD), which affecting maize stalk lodging-resistance and feeding values, respectively. 

Results: Phenotypic correlation coefficients ranged from 0.38 to 0.69 between the two populations for eight stalk traits. Heritability values of all stalk traits ranged from 0.49 to 0.81 in the DH population, and 0.58 to 0.89 in the haploid population. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping study showed that a total of 47 QTL for all traits accounting for genetic variations ranging from 1.6 to 36.5% were detected in two populations. One or more QTL sharing common region for each trait were detected between two different ploidy populations. Potential candidate genes predicated from the four QTL support intervals for RPR and IVDMD were indirectly or directly involved with cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, which participated in cell wall formation. The increased expression levels of lignin and cellulose synthesis key genes in the haploid situation illustrated that dosage compensation may account for genome dosage effect in our study. 

Conclusions: The current investigation extended understanding about the genetic basis of stalk traits and correlations between DH and its haploid populations, which showed consistence and difference between them in phenotype, QTL characters, and gene expression. The higher heritabilities and partly higher QTL detection power were presented in haploid population than in DH population. All of which described above could lay a preliminary foundation for genetic architecture study with haploid population and may benefit selection in haploid-stage to reduce cost in DH breeding."
27012534,anthesis-silking interval,Identification of genetic variants associated with maize flowering time using an extremely large multi-genetic background population,"Flowering time is one of the major adaptive traits in maize domestication and an important selection criterion in breeding. To detect more maize flowering time variants, we evaluated flowering time traits using an extremely large multi- genetic background population that contained more than 8000 lines under multiple Sino-United States (Sino-US) environments. The population included two nested association mapping (NAM) panels and a natural association panel. Near one million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in the analyses. Through the parallel linkage analysis of the two NAM panels, both common and unique flowering time regions were detected. Genome-wide, a total of 90 flowering time regions were identified. One third of these regions were connected to traits associated with the environmental sensitivity of maize flowering time. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the three panels identified nearly one thousand flowering time associated SNPs, mainly distributed around 220 candidate genes (within the distance of 1 Mb). Interestingly, two types of regions were significantly enriched for these associated SNPs one was the candidate gene regions and the other was the ~ 5 kb regions away from the candidate genes. Moreover, the associated SNPs exhibited high accuracy for predicting flowering time."
27071055,response to Fusarium kernel rot,"Assessing pigmented pericarp of maize kernels as possible source of resistance to fusarium ear rot, Fusarium spp. infection and fumonisin accumulation","One of the purposes of maize genetic improvement is the research of genotypes resistant to fusarium ear rot (FER) and fumonisin accumulation. Flavonoids in the pericarp of the kernels are considered particularly able to reduce the fumonisin accumulation (FUM). The aim of this field study was to assess the effect of flavonoids, associated with anti-insect protection and Fusarium verticillioides inoculation, on FER symptoms and fumonisin contamination in maize kernels. Two isogenic hybrids, one having pigmentation in the pericarp (P1-rr) and the other without it (P1-wr), were compared. P1-rr showed lower values of FER symptoms and FUM contamination than P1-wr only if the anti-insect protection and the F. verticillioides inoculations were applied in combination. Fusarium spp. kernel infection was not influenced by the presence of flavonoids in the pericarp. Artificial F. verticillioides inoculation was more effective than anti-insect protection in enhancing the inhibition activity of flavonoids toward FUM contamination. The interactions between FUM contamination levels and FER ratings were better modeled in the pigmented hybrid than in the unpigmented one. The variable role that the pigment played in kernel defense against FER and FUM indicates that flavonoids alone may not be completely effective in the resistance of fumonisin contamination in maize."

Water deficit or drought is one of the most serious abiotic stresses of plant development and greatly reduces crop production, and the plant's response to this deficit leads to many metabolic changes. To dissect the genetic basis of these metabolic traits in maize, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of drought-related traits using 156,599 SNPs in 318 maize inbred lines. In total, 123 significant SNP/trait associations (P &#8804; 6.39E-6) involving 63 loci were identified for related metabolic and physiological traits in multiple tissues and different environments under two irrigation conditions. Of the 63, 23 loci demonstrated a significant interaction effect between QTL and water status, indicating that these metabolite-associated loci were probably related to drought stress tolerance. To evaluate the potential utility of metabolite-associated loci applied in hybrid maize breeding, we assembled two groups of hybrid entries with high or low drought tolerance and measured the metabolic and physiological traits. In the hybrid pools, a set of 10 metabolite-associated loci identified in leaf and ear were validated as responsive to drought stress. The favorable alleles of these ten loci were significantly enriched in hybrids with high drought tolerance, which jointly explained almost 18.4 % of the variation in drought tolerance using a multivariate logistic regression model. These results provide clues to understanding the genetic basis of metabolic and physiological changes related to drought tolerance, potentially facilitating the genetic improvement of varieties with high drought tolerance in maize breeding programs."
27352627,response to Gibberella stalk rot,Transcriptome analysis of maize resistance to Fusarium graminearum,"BACKGROUND: Gibberella stalk rot caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most destructive soil-borne diseases of maize (Zea mays L.). Chemical means of controlling Gibberella stalk rot are not very effective; development of highly resistant hybrids is the best choice for disease control. Hence, understanding of the molecular basis underlying maize resistance against Gibberella stalk rot would undoubtedly facilitate the resistance breeding for stalk rot.<P> RESULTS: Two quantitative trait loci (QTL), qRfg1 and qRfg2, conferring resistance to Gibberella stalk rot were detected in our previous study. Three near-isogenic lines (NILs) of maize with either qRfg1 (NIL1) or qRfg2 (NIL2), or neither (NIL3) were generated and subjected to RNA sequencing to study the transcriptional changes after F. graminearum inoculation at 0 (control), 6, and 18 h post-inoculation (hpi). In total, 536,184,652 clean reads were generated, and gene expression levels were calculated using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads). A total of 7252 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the three NILs after F. graminearum inoculation. As many as 2499 DEGs were detected between NIL1 and NIL3 at 0 hpi, of which 884 DEGs were more abundant in NIL1 and enriched in defense responses. After F. graminearum inoculation, 1070 and 751 genes were exclusively up- and downregulated, respectively, in NIL1 as compared to NIL3. The 1070 upregulated DEGs were enriched in growth/development, photosynthesis/biogenesis, and defense-related responses. Genes encoding putative auxin-induced proteins and GH3 family proteins in auxin signaling pathway were highly induced and lasted longer in NIL3. Genes involved in polar auxin transport (PAT) were more abundant in NIL3 as compared with NIL2.<P> CONCLUSIONS:The qRfg1 confers its resistance to Gibberella stalk rot through both constitutive and induced high expression of defense-related genes; while qRfg2 enhances maize resistance to the disease via relatively lower induction of auxin signaling and repression of PAT. The defense-related transcriptional changes underlying each QTL will undoubtedly facilitate our understanding of the resistance mechanism and resistance breeding for maize stalk rot."
27379519,recombination frequency,"Analysis of recombination QTLs, segregation distortion, and epistasis for fitness in maize multiple populations using ultra-high-density markers","Using two nested association mapping populations and high-density markers, some important genomic regions controlling recombination frequency and segregation distortion were detected. Understanding the maize genomic features would be useful for the study of genetic diversity and evolution and for maize breeding. Here, we used two maize nested association mapping (NAM) populations separately derived in China (CN-NAM) and the US (US-NAM) to explore the maize genomic features. The two populations containing 36 families and about 7000 recombinant inbred lines were evaluated with genotyping-by-sequencing. Through the comparison between the two NAMs, we revealed that segregation distortion is little, whereas epistasis for fitness is present in the two maize NAM populations. When conducting quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for the total number of recombination events, we detected 14 QTLs controlling recombination. Using high-density markers to identify segregation distortion regions (SDRs), a total of 445 SDRs were detected within the 36 families, among which 15 common SDRs were found in at least ten families. About 80 % of the known maize gametophytic factors (ga) genes controlling segregation distortion were overlapped with highly significant SDRs. In addition, we also found that the regions with high recombination rate and high gene density usually tended to have little segregation distortion. This study will facilitate population genetic studies and gene cloning affecting recombination variation and segregation distortion in maize, which can improve plant breeding progress."
27406166,response to western corn rootworm,Dynamic precision phenotyping reveals mechanism of crop tolerance to root herbivory,"The western corn rootworm (WCR) is a major pest of maize that is well adapted to most crop management strategies. Breeding for tolerance is a promising alternative to combat WCR, but is currently constrained by a lack of physiological understanding and phenotyping tools. We developed dynamic precision phenotyping approaches using carbon-11 with positron emission tomography, root autoradiography and radiometabolite flux analysis to understand maize tolerance to WCR. Our results reveal that WCR attack induces specific patterns of lateral root growth which are associated with a shift in auxin biosynthesis from indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetonitrile. WCR attack also increases transport of newly synthesized amino acids to the roots, including the accumulation of glutamine. Finally, the regrowth zones of WCR attacked roots show an increase in glutamine turnover which strongly correlates with the induction of indole-3-acetonitrile-dependent auxin biosynthesis. In summary, our findings identify local changes in the auxin flux network as a promising marker for induced WCR tolerance."
27440866,days to flowering,Fast-flowering mini-maize: seed to seed in 60 days,"Two lines of Zea mays were developed as a short-generation model for maize. The Fast-Flowering Mini-Maize (FFMM) lines A and B are robust inbred lines with a significantly shorter generation time, much smaller stature, and better greenhouse adaptation than traditional maize varieties. Five generations a year are typical. FFMM is the result of a modified double-cross hybrid between four fast-flowering lines: Neuffer's Early ACR (full color), Alexander's Early Early Synthetic, Tom Thumb Popcorn, and Gaspe Flint, followed by selection for early flowering and desirable morphology throughout an 11-generation selfing regime. Lines A and B were derived from different progeny of the initial hybrid, and crosses between Mini-Maize A and B exhibit heterosis. The ancestry of each genomic region of Mini-Maize A and B was inferred from the four founder populations using genotyping by sequencing. Other genetic and genomic tools for these lines include karyotypes for both lines A and B, kernel genetic markers y1 (white endosperm) and R1-scm2 (purple endosperm and embryo) introgressed into Mini-Maize A, and ~24x whole-genome resequencing data for Mini-Maize A."
27457125,days to flowering,Flowering time regulated genes in maize include the transcription factor ZmMADS1,"Flowering time control (FTi) is well examined in the long day plant Arabidopsis and increasing knowledge is available for the short day plant rice. In contrast little is known in the day-neutral and agronomically important crop plant maize. To learn more about FTi and to identify novel regulators in this species we first compared the time points of floral transition of almost 30 maize inbred lines and show that tropical lines exhibit a delay in flowering transition of more than three weeks under long days conditions compared to European flint lines adapted to temperate climate zones. We further analyzed the leaf transcriptomes of four lines that exhibit strong differences in flowering transition to identify new key players of the flowering control network in maize. We found strong differences among regulated genes between these lines and thus assume that the regulation of FTi is very complex in maize. Especially genes encoding MADS-box transcriptional regulators are up-regulated in leaves during meristem transition. ZmMADS1 was selected for functional studies. We demonstrate that it represents a functional ortholog of the central FTi integrator SOC1 of Arabidopsis. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of ZmMADS1 resulted in a delay of FTi in maize, while strong overexpression caused an early flowering phenotype indicating its role as a flowering activator. Taken together we report that ZmMADS1 represents a positive FTi regulator that shares an evolutionary conserved function with SOC1 and may now serve as an ideal stating point to study the integration and variation of FTi pathways also in maize."
27564650,response to Ustilago maydis,Chloroplast-associated metabolic functions influence the susceptibility of maize to Ustilago maydis.,"Biotrophic fungal pathogens must evade or suppress plant defence responses to establish a compatible interaction in living host tissue. In addition, metabolic changes during disease reflect both the impact of nutrient acquisition by the fungus to support proliferation and the integration of metabolism with the plant defence response. In this study, we used transcriptome analyses to predict that the chloroplast and associated functions are important for symptom formation by the biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis on maize. We tested our prediction by examining the impact on disease of a genetic defect (whirly1) in chloroplast function. In addition, we examined whether disease was influenced by inhibition of glutamine synthetase by glufosinate (impacting amino acid biosynthesis) or inhibition of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase by glyphosate (influencing secondary metabolism). All of these perturbations increased the severity of disease, thus suggesting a contribution to resistance. Overall, these findings provide a framework for understanding the components of host metabolism that benefit the plant versus the pathogen during a biotrophic interaction. They also reinforce the emerging importance of the chloroplast as a mediator of plant defence."
27585732,kernel length; kernel number per ear; kernel thickness,"A robust, high-throughput method for computing maize ear, cob, and kernel attributes automatically from images","Grain yield of the maize plant depends on the sizes, shapes, and numbers of ears and the kernels they bear. An automated pipeline that can measure these components of yield from easily-obtained digital images is needed to advance our understanding of this globally important crop. Here we present three custom algorithms designed to compute such yield components automatically from digital images acquired by a low-cost platform. One algorithm determines the average space each kernel occupies along the cob axis using a sliding-window Fourier transform analysis of image intensity features. A second counts individual kernels removed from ears, including those in clusters. A third measures each kernel's major and minor axis after a Bayesian analysis of contour points identifies the kernel tip. Dimensionless ear and kernel shape traits that may interrelate yield components are measured by principal components analysis of contour point sets. Increased objectivity and speed compared to typical manual methods are achieved without loss of accuracy as evidenced by high correlations with ground truth measurements and simulated data. Millimeter-scale differences among ear, cob, and kernel traits that ranged more than 2.5-fold across a diverse group of inbred maize lines were resolved. This system for measuring maize ear, cob, and kernel attributes is being used by multiple research groups as an automated Web service running on community high-throughput computing and distributed data storage infrastructure. Users may create their own workflow using the source code that is staged for download on a public repository."
27659341,response to aluminum,Genomewide analysis of MATE-type gene family in maize reveals microsynteny and their expression patterns under aluminum treatment.,"Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) proteins are a group of secondary active transporters, which widely exist in all living organisms and play important role in the detoxication of endogenous secondary metabolites and exogenous agents. However, to date, no systematic and comprehensive study of this family is reported in maize. Here, a total of 49 MATE genes (ZmMATE) were identified and divided into seven groups by phylogenetic analysis. Conserved intro-exon structures and motif compositions were investigated in these genes. Results by gene locations indicated that these genes were unevenly distributed among all 10 chromosomes. Tandem and segmental duplications appeared to contribute to the expansion and evolution of this gene family. The Ka/Ks ratios suggested that the ZmMATE has undergone large-scale purifying selection on the maize genome. Interspecies microsynteny analysis revealed that there were independent gene duplication events of 10 ZmMATE. In addition, most maize MATE genes exhibited different expression profiles in diverse tissues and developmental stages. Sixteen MATE genes were chosen for further quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed differential expression patterns in response to aluminum treatment. These results provide a useful clue for future studies on the identification of MATE genes and functional analysis of MATE proteins in maize."
27695059,internode length (stem),Genome-wide identification of miRNAs and their targets involved in the developing internodes under maize ears by responding to hormone signaling,"Internode length is one of the decisive factors affecting plant height (PH) and ear height (EH), which are closely associated with the lodging resistance, biomass and grain yield of maize. miRNAs, currently recognized as important transcriptional/ post-transcriptional regulators, play an essential role in plant growth and development. However, their roles in developing internodes under maize ears remain unclear. To identify the roles of miRNAs and their targets in the development of internodes under maize ears, six miRNA and two degradome libraries were constructed using the 7th, 8th and 9th internodes of two inbred lines, 'Xun928' and 'Xun9058', which had significantly different internode lengths. A total of 45 and 54 miRNAs showed significant changes for each pairwise comparison among the 7th, 8th and 9th internodes of 'Xun9058' and 'Xun928', respectively. The expression of 31 miRNAs showed significant changes were common to the corresponding comparison groups of the 7th, 8th and 9th internodes of 'Xun9058' and 'Xun928'. For the corresponding internodes of 'Xun9058' and 'Xun928', compared with the expression of miRNAs in the 7th, 8th and 9th internodes of 'Xun928', the numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs were 11 and 36 in the 7th internode, 9 and 45 in the 8th internode, and 9 and 25 in the 9th internode of 'Xun9058', respectively. Moreover, 10 miRNA families containing 45 members showed significant changes at least in two internodes of 'Xun928' by comparing with the corresponding internodes of 'Xun9058'. Based on the sequencing data, 20 miRNAs related to hormone signaling among the candidates, belonging to five conserved miRNA families, were selected for expression profiling using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The five miRNA families, zma-miR160, zma-miR167, zma-miR164, zma-miR169 and zma-miR393, targeted the genes encoding auxin response factor, N-acetylcysteine domain containing protein, nuclear transcription factor Y and auxin signaling F-BOX 2 through degradome sequencing. The miRNAs might regulate their targets to respond to hormone signaling, thereby regulating the internode elongation and development under maize ear. These results provide valuable reference for understanding the possible regulation mechanism of the ILs under the ear."
27762444,response to flooding,A major locus involved in the formation of the radial oxygen loss barrier in adventitious roots of teosinte Zea nicaraguensis is located on the short-arm of chromosome 3,"A radial oxygen loss (ROL) barrier in roots of waterlogging-tolerant plants promotes oxygen movement via aerenchyma to the root tip, and impedes soil phytotoxin entry. The molecular mechanism and genetic regulation of ROL barrier formation are largely unknown. Zea nicaraguensis, a waterlogging-tolerant wild relative of maize (Z. mays ssp. mays), forms a tight ROL barrier in its roots when waterlogged. We used Z. nicaraguensis chromosome segment introgression lines (ILs) in maize (inbred line Mi29) to elucidate the chromosomal region involved in regulating root ROL barrier formation. A segment of the short-arm of chromosome 3 of Z. nicaraguensis conferred ROL barrier formation in the genetic background of maize. This chromosome segment also decreased apoplastic solute permeability across the hypodermis/exodermis. However, the IL and maize were similar for suberin staining in the hypodermis/exodermis at 40&#8201;mm and further behind the root tip. Z. nicaraguensis contained suberin in the hypodermis/exodermis at 20&#8201;mm and lignin at the epidermis. The IL with ROL barrier, however, did not contain lignin in the epidermis. Discovery of the Z. nicaraguensis chromosomal region responsible for root ROL barrier formation has improved knowledge of this trait and is an important step towards improvement of waterlogging tolerance in maize."
27769176,forage quality,Genome-wide association analysis of forage quality in maize mature stalk.,"Background: Plant digestibility of silage maize (Zea mays L.) has a large influence on nutrition intake for animal feeding. Improving forage quality will enhance the utilization efficiency and feeding value of forage maize. Dissecting the genetic basis of forage quality will improve our understanding of the complex nature of cell wall biosynthesis and degradation, which is also helpful for breeding good quality silage maize. 

Results: Acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of stalk were evaluated in a diverse maize population, which is comprised of 368 inbred lines and planted across seven environments. Using a mixed model accounting for population structure and polygenic background effects, a genome-wide association study was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with forage quality. Scanning 559,285 SNPs across the whole genome, 73, 41 and 82 SNPs were found to be associated with ADF, NDF, and IVDMD, respectively. Each significant SNP explained 4.2 %-6.2 % of the phenotypic variation. Underlying these associated loci, 56 genes were proposed as candidate genes for forage quality. 

Conclusions: Of all the candidate genes proposed by GWAS, we only found a C3H gene (ZmC3H2) that is directly involved in cell wall component biosynthesis. The candidate genes found in this study are mainly involved in signal transduction, stress resistance, and transcriptional regulation of cell wall biosynthetic gene expression. Adding high digestibility maize into the association panel would be helpful for increasing genetic variability and identifying more genes associated with forage quality traits. Cloning and functional validation of these genes would be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanism of the fiber content and digestibility. These findings provide us new insights into cell wall formation and deposition."
27770199,inflorescence development,Genetic regulation of maize flower development and sex determination,"The determining process of pistil fate are central to maize sex determination, mainly regulated by a genetic network in which the sex-determining genes SILKLESS 1 , TASSEL SEED 1 , TASSEL SEED 2 and the paramutagenic locus Required to maintain repression 6 play pivotal roles. Maize silks, which emerge from the ear shoot and derived from the pistil, are the functional stigmas of female flowers and play a pivotal role in pollination. Previous studies on sex-related mutants have revealed that sex-determining genes and phytohormones play an important role in the regulation of flower organogenesis. The processes determining pistil fate are central to flower development, where a silk identified gene SILKLESS 1 (SK1) is required to protect pistil primordia from a cell death signal produced by two commonly known genes, TASSEL SEED 1 (TS1) and TASSEL SEED 2 (TS2). In this review, maize flower developmental process is presented together with a focus on important sex-determining mutants and hormonal signaling affecting pistil development. The role of sex-determining genes, microRNAs, phytohormones, and the paramutagenic locus Required to maintain repression 6 (Rmr6), in forming a regulatory network that determines pistil fate, is discussed. Cloning SK1 and clarifying its function were crucial in understanding the regulation network of sex determination. The signaling mechanisms of phytohormones in sex determination are also an important research focus."
27793787,DNA modification,Dynamic and antagonistic allele-specific epigenetic modifications controlling the expression of imprinted genes in maize endosperm,"Genomic imprinting is often associated with allele-specific epigenetic modifications. Although there are many reports suggesting the potential roles of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 in regulation of genomic imprinting, research about the contributions of allele-specific active histone modifications to imprinting has been highly limited in plant. Here we reported the identification of 337 high-stringency allele-specific H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks in maize endosperm. Paternally preferred H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks mostly co-localized at paternally expressed genes (PEGs), while endosperm-specific maternally expressed genes (endo-MEGs) were associated with maternally preferred H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks. A unique signature for PEGs was observed, where the active H3K4me4, H3K36me3 and repressive H3K27me3 showed up altogether. At gene body of con-PEGs (constitutively expressed PEG), H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 were specifically deposited on hypomethylated maternal alleles and hypermethylated paternal alleles respectively. Around TSS of endo-MEGs, DNA methylation and H3K4me3 specifically marked on paternal and maternal alleles respectively. Additionally, 35 maternally expressed non-coding RNAs (MNCs) exhibited same allele-specific epigenetic features with endo-MEGs, indicating similar mechanism for regulation of imprinted genes and non-coding RNAs. Our results uncover the complex patterns of mutually exclusive epigenetic modifications deposited at different alleles of imprinted genes that are required for the genomic imprinting in maize endosperm."
27825295,anthesis-silking interval; drought response,Numerous genetic loci identified for drought tolerance in the maize nested association mapping populations,"Background: Maize requires more water than most other crops; therefore, the water use efficiency of this crop must be improved for maize production under undesirable land and changing environmental conditions.<p> Results: To elucidate the genetic control of drought in maize, we evaluated approximately 5000 inbred lines from 30 linkage-association joint mapping populations under two contrasting water regimes for seven drought-related traits, including yield and anthesis-silking interval (ASI). The joint linkage analysis was conducted to identify 220 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) under well-watered conditions and 169 QTLs under water-stressed conditions. The genome-wide association analysis identified 365 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with drought-related traits, and these SNPs were located in 354 candidate genes. Fifty-two of these genes showed significant differential expression in the inbred line B73 under the well-watered and water-stressed conditions. In addition, genomic predictions suggested that the moderate-density SNPs obtained through genotyping-by-sequencing were able to make accurate predictions in the nested association mapping population for drought-related traits with moderate-to-high heritability under the water-stressed conditions.<p> Conclusions: The results of the present study provide important information that can be used to understand the genetic basis of drought stress responses and facilitate the use of beneficial alleles for the improvement of drought tolerance in maize."
27876803,Phenology,Association mapping for phenology and plant architecture in maize shows higher power for developmental traits compared with growth influenced traits,"Plant architecture, phenology and yield components of cultivated plants have repeatedly been shaped by selection to meet human needs and adaptation to different environments. Here we assessed the genetic architecture of 24 correlated maize traits that interact during plant cycle. Overall, 336 lines were phenotyped in a network of 9 trials and genotyped with 50K single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Phenology was the main factor of differentiation between genetic groups. Then yield components distinguished dents from lower yielding genetic groups. However, most of trait variation occurred within group and we observed similar overall and within group correlations, suggesting a major effect of pleiotropy and/or linkage. We found 34 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for individual traits and six for trait combinations corresponding to PCA coordinates. Among them, only five were pleiotropic. We found a cluster of QTLs in a 5 Mb region around Tb1 associated with tiller number, ear row number and the first PCA axis, the latter being positively correlated to flowering time and negatively correlated to yield. Kn1 and ZmNIP1 were candidate genes for tillering, ZCN8 for leaf number and Rubisco Activase 1 for kernel weight. Experimental repeatabilities, numbers of QTLs and proportion of explained variation were higher for traits related to plant development such as tillering, leaf number and flowering time, than for traits affected by growth such as yield components. This suggests a simpler genetic determinism with larger individual QTL effects for the first category."
27999083,drought response,Stability of single parent gene expression complementation in maize hybrids upon water deficit stress,"Heterosis is the superior performance of F1-hybrids compared to their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1-hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by PEG treatment. Single parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In the present study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While on average 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to PEG treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation suggests a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions."
28045987,days to flowering; Flowering; photoperiod response,High-throughput resequencing of maize landraces at genomic regions associated with flowering time,"Despite the reduction in the price of sequencing, it remains expensive to sequence and assemble whole, complex genomes of multiple samples for population studies, particularly for large genomes like those of many crop species. Enrichment of target genome regions coupled with next generation sequencing is a cost-effective strategy to obtain sequence information for loci of interest across many individuals, providing a less expensive approach to evaluating sequence variation at the population scale. Here we evaluate amplicon-based enrichment coupled with semiconductor sequencing on a validation set consisting of three maize inbred lines, two hybrids and 19 landrace accessions. We report the use of a multiplexed panel of 319 PCR assays that target 20 candidate loci associated with photoperiod sensitivity in maize while requiring 25 ng or less of starting DNA per sample. Enriched regions had an average on-target sequence read depth of 105 with 98% of the sequence data mapping to the maize 'B73' reference and 80% of the reads mapping to the target interval. Sequence reads were aligned to B73 and 1,486 and 1,244 variants were called using SAMtools and GATK, respectively. Of the variants called by both SAMtools and GATK, 30% were not previously reported in maize. Due to the high sequence read depth, heterozygote genotypes could be called with at least 92.5% accuracy in hybrid materials using GATK. The genetic data are congruent with previous reports of high total genetic diversity and substantial population differentiation among maize landraces. In conclusion, semiconductor sequencing of highly multiplexed PCR reactions is a cost-effective strategy for resequencing targeted genomic loci in diverse maize materials."
28166212,days to flowering,A study of allelic diversity underlying flowering-time adaptation in maize landraces,"Landraces (traditional varieties) of domesticated species preserve useful genetic variation, yet they remain untapped due to the genetic linkage between the few useful alleles and hundreds of undesirable alleles. We integrated two approaches to characterize the diversity of 4,471 maize landraces. First, we mapped genomic regions controlling latitudinal and altitudinal adaptation and identified 1,498 genes. Second, we used F-one association mapping (FOAM) to map the genes that control flowering time, across 22 environments, and identified 1,005 genes. In total, we found that 61.4% of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with altitude were also associated with flowering time. More than half of the SNPs associated with altitude were within large structural variants (inversions, centromeres and pericentromeric regions). The combined mapping results indicate that although floral regulatory network genes contribute substantially to field variation, over 90% of the contributing genes probably have indirect effects. Our dual strategy can be used to harness the landrace diversity of plants and animals."
28188181,kernel composition,Genetic analysis of teosinte alleles for kernel composition traits in maize,"Teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) is the wild ancestor of modern maize (Zea mays ssp. mays). Teosinte contains greater genetic diversity compared with maize inbreds and landraces, but its use is limited by insufficient genetic resources to evaluate its value. A population of teosinte near isogenic lines (NILs) was previously developed to broaden the resources for genetic diversity of maize, and to discover novel alleles for agronomic and domestication traits. The 961 teosinte NILs were developed by backcrossing 10 geographically diverse parviglumis accessions into the B73 (reference genome inbred) background. The NILs were grown in two replications in 2009 and 2010 in Columbia, MO and Aurora, NY, respectively, and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance calibrations were developed and used to rapidly predict total kernel starch, protein, and oil content on a dry matter basis in bulk whole grains of teosinte NILs. Our joint-linkage quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis identified two starch, three protein, and six oil QTL, which collectively explained 18, 23, and 45% of the total variation, respectively. A range of strong additive allelic effects for kernel starch, protein, and oil content were identified relative to the B73 allele. Our results support our hypothesis that teosinte harbors stronger alleles for kernel composition traits than maize, and that teosinte can be exploited for the improvement of kernel composition traits in modern maize germplasm."
28267956,kernel development,Signaling in early maize kernel development,"Developing the next plant generation within the seed requires the coordination of complex programs driving pattern formation, growth, and differentiation of the three main seed compartments: the embryo (future plant), the endosperm (storage compartment), representing the two filial tissues, and the surrounding maternal tissues. This review focuses on the signaling pathways and molecular players involved in early maize kernel development. In the 2 weeks following pollination, functional tissues are shaped from single cells, readying the kernel for filling with storage compounds. Although the overall picture of the signaling pathways regulating embryo and endosperm development remains fragmentary, several types of molecular actors, such as hormones, sugars, or peptides, have been shown to be involved in particular aspects of these developmental processes. These molecular actors are likely to be components of signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional programming mediated by transcriptional factors. Through the integrated action of these components, multiple types of information received by cells or tissues lead to the correct differentiation and patterning of kernel compartments. In this review, recent advances regarding the four types of molecular actors (hormones, sugars, peptides/receptors, and transcription factors) involved in early maize development are presented."
28342108,response to Cercospora,Fine mapping of a quantitative resistance gene for gray leaf spot of maize (Zea mays L.) derived from teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis),"In previous work, using near isogenic line (NIL) populations in which segments of the teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) genome had been introgressed into the background of the maize line B73, we had identified a QTL on chromosome 8, here called Qgls8, for gray leaf spot (GLS) resistance. We identified alternate teosinte alleles at this QTL, one conferring increased GLS resistance and one increased susceptibility relative to the B73 allele. Using segregating populations derived from NIL parents carrying these contrasting alleles, we were able to delimit the QTL region to a ~130 kb (based on the B73 genome) which encompassed five predicted genes."
28389771,male fertility,QTL mapping for haploid male fertility by a segregation distortion method and fine mapping of a key QTL qhmf4 in maize,"Four QTL related to haploid male fertility were detected by a segregation distortion method and the key QTL qhmf4 was fine mapped to an interval of ~800 kb. Doubled haploid (DH) technology enables rapid development of homozygous lines in maize breeding programs. However, haploid genome doubling is a bottleneck for the commercialization of DH technology and is limited by haploid male fertility (HMF). This is the first study reporting the quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of HMF in maize. Four QTL, qhmf1, qhmf2, qhmf3, and qhmf4, controlling HMF have been identified by segregation distortion (SD) loci detection in the selected haploid population derived from 'Yu87-1/Zheng58'. Three loci, qhmf1, qhmf2, and qhmf4, were also detected in the selected haploid population derived from '4F1/Zheng58'. The QTL qhmf4 showed the strongest SD in both haploid populations. Based on the sequence information of 'Yu87-1' and 'Zheng58', thirteen markers being polymorphic between the two lines were developed to saturate the qhmf4 region. A total of 8168 H1BC2 (haploid backcross generation) plants produced from 'Yu87-1' and 'Zheng58' were screened for recombinants. All the 48 recombinants were backcrossed to 'Zheng58' to develop H1BC3 progeny. The heterozygous H1BC3 individuals were crossed with CAU5 to induce haploids. In each H1BC3 progeny, haploids were genotyped and evaluated for anther emergence score (AES). Significant (or no significant) difference (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) between haploids with or without 'Yu87-1' donor segment indicated presence or absence of qhmf4 in the donor segment. The analysis of the 48 recombinants narrowed the qhmf4 locus down to an ~800 kb interval flanked by markers IND166 and IND1668."
28396554,grain yield; Physiologic,"Exploiting the genetic diversity of maize using a combined metabolomic, enzyme activity profiling, and metabolic modelling approach to link leaf physiology to kernel yield","A combined metabolomic, biochemical, fluxomic, and metabolic modelling approach was developed using nineteen genetically distant maize (Zea mays L.) lines from Europe and America. Considerable differences were detected between the lines when leaf metabolic profiles and activities of the main enzymes involved in primary metabolism were compared. During grain filling, the leaf metabolic composition appeared to be a reliable marker, allowing a classification matching the genetic diversity of the lines. During the same period, there was a significant correlation between the genetic distance of the lines and the activities of enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, notably glycolysis. Although large differences were observed in terms of leaf metabolic fluxes, these variations were not tightly linked to the genome structure of the lines. Both correlation studies and metabolic network analyses allowed the description of a maize ideotype with a high grain yield potential. Such an ideotype is characterized by low accumulation of soluble amino acids and carbohydrates in the leaves and high activity of enzymes involved in the C4 photosynthetic pathway and in the biosynthesis of amino acids derived from glutamate. Chlorogenates appear to be important markers that can be used to select for maize lines that produce larger kernels."
28399169,photoperiod response,A photoperiod-responsive protein compendium and conceptual proteome roadmap outline in maize grown in growth chambers with controlled conditions,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the major staple food crops of the world. However, high photoperiod sensitivity, especially for tropical germplasms, impedes attempts to improve maize agronomical traits by integration of tropical and temperate maize germplasms. Physiological and phenotypic responses of maize to photoperiod have widely been investigated based on multi-site field observations; however, proteome-based responsive mechanisms under controlled photoperiod regimes, nutrient and moisture soils are not yet well understood. In the present study, we sequenced and analyzed six proteomes of tropically-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive M9 inbred line at the vegetative 3 stage and proteomes from tropically-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive Shuang M9 (SM9) inbred line at the vegetative-tasseling stage. All plants were grown in growth chambers with controlled soil and temperature and three photoperiod regimes, a short photoperiod (SP) of 10 h light/14 h dark, a control neutral photoperiod (NP) of 12 h light/12 h dark, and a long photoperiod (LP) of 16 h light/8 h dark for a daily cycle. We identified 4,395 proteins of which 401 and 425 differentially-expressed proteins (DPs) were found in abundance in M9 leaves and in SM9 leaves as per SP/LP vs. NP, respectively. Some DPs showed responses to both SP and LP while some only responded to either SP or LP, depending on M9 or SM9. Our study showed that the photoperiodic response pathway, circadian clock rhythm, and high light density/intensity crosstalk with each other, but apparently differ from dark signaling routes. Photoperiod response involves light-responsive or dark-responsive proteins or both. The DPs positioned on the signaling routes from photoperiod changes to RNA/DNA responses involve the mago nashi homolog and glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins. Moreover, the cell-to-cell movement of ZCN14 through plasmodesmata is likely blocked under a 16-h-light LP. Here, we propose a photoperiodic model based on our findings and those from previous studies."
28422143,response to Fusarium kernel rot,Dissecting the genetic architecture of Fusarium verticillioides seed rot resistance in maize by combining QTL mapping and genome-wide association analysis.,"Fusarium verticillioides can be transmitted via seeds and cause systemic infection in maize (Zea mays L.); its mycotoxin has harmful effects on animal and human health. We combined QTL mapping in recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 217 diverse maize lines using 224,152 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under controlled conditions to determine the genetic architecture of F. verticillioides seed rot (FSR) resistance. Our study identified 8 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 43 genes associated with 57 SNPs that were correlated with FSR resistance through linkage mapping and GWAS, respectively. Among these, there were three candidate genes, namely GRMZM2G0081223, AC213654.3_FG004, and GRMZM2G099255, which were detected in both linkage mapping and GWAS. Furthermore, the near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing GRMZM2G0081223, which also had a susceptible parent background, were found to have a significantly improved level of resistance. In addition, the expression profile of the three candidate genes revealed that they all respond to the infection following inoculation with F. verticillioides. These genetic analyses indicate that FSR resistance is controlled by loci with minor effect, and the polymerization breeding of lines with beneficial alleles and candidate genes could improve FSR resistance in maize."
28446022,Anthocyanin content,A survey of anthocyanin composition and concentration in diverse maize germplasm,"Increasing consumer demand for natural ingredients in foods and beverages justifies investigations into more economic sources of natural colorants. In this study, 398 genetically diverse pigmented accessions of maize were analyzed using HPLC to characterize the diversity of anthocyanin composition and concentration in maize germplasm. 167 accessions were identified that could produce anthocyanins in the kernel pericarp or aleurone and were classified into compositional categories. Total anthocyanin content was highest in pericarp-pigmented accessions with flavanol-anthocyanin condensed forms, similar to the Andean Ma��z Morado landraces. A selected subset of accessions exhibited high broad-sense heritability estimates for anthocyanin production, indicating this trait can be manipulated through breeding. This study represents the most comprehensive screening of pigmented maize lines to date, and will provide information to plant breeders looking to develop anthocyanin-rich maize hybrids as an economic source of natural colorants in foods and beverages."
28659961,response to flooding,Bulked segregant RNA-seq reveals differential expression and SNPs of candidate genes associated with waterlogging tolerance in maize,"Waterlogging has increasingly become one of the major constraints to maize productivity in some maize production zones because it causes serious yield loss. Bulked segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) has been widely applied to profile candidate genes and map associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers in many species. In this study, 10 waterlogging sensitive and eight tolerant inbred lines were selected from 60 maize inbred lines with waterlogging response determined and preselected by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) from over 400 tropical maize inbred lines. BSR-seq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes and SNPs associated with waterlogging tolerance. Upon waterlogging stress, 354 and 1094 genes were differentially expressed in the tolerant and sensitive pools, respectively, compared to untreated controls. When tolerant and sensitive pools were compared, 593 genes were differentially expressed under untreated and 431 genes under waterlogged conditions, of which 122 genes overlapped. To validate the BSR-seq results, the expression levels of six genes were determined by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with BSR-seq results. Comparison of allelic polymorphism in mRNA sequences between tolerant and sensitive pools revealed 165 (normal condition) and 128 (waterlogged condition) high-probability SNPs. We found 18 overlapping SNPs with genomic positions mapped. Eighteen SNPs were contained in 18 genes, and eight and nine of 18 genes were responsive to waterlogging stress in tolerant and sensitive lines, respectively. Six alleles of the 18 originated from tolerant pool were significantly up-regulated under waterlogging, but not those from sensitive pool. Importantly, one allele (GRMZM2G055704) of the six genes was mapped between umc1619 and umc1948 on chromosome 1 where a QTL associated with waterlogging tolerance was identified in a previous research, strongly indicating that GRMZM2G055704 is a candidate gene responsive to waterlogging. Our research contributes to the knowledge of the molecular mechanism for waterlogging tolerance in maize."
28681159,agrobacterium mediated transformation,Selectable marker independent transformation of recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 mediated by morphogenic regulators BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2,"Discriminatory co-expression of maize BBM and WUS transcriptional factor genes promoted somatic embryogenesis and efficient Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 genotypes without use of a selectable marker gene. The use of morphogenic regulators to overcome barriers in plant transformation is a revolutionary breakthrough for basic plant science and crop applications. Current standard plant transformation systems are bottlenecks for genetic, genomic, and crop improvement studies. We investigated the differential use of co-expression of maize transcription factors BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 coupled with a desiccation inducible CRE/lox excision system to enable regeneration of stable transgenic recalcitrant maize inbred B73 and sorghum P898012 without a chemical selectable marker. The PHP78891 expression cassette contains CRE driven by the drought inducible maize RAB17M promoter with lox P sites which bracket the CRE, WUS, and BBM genes. A constitutive maize UBI M promoter directs a ZsGreen GFP expression cassette as a reporter outside of the excision sites and provides transient, transgenic, and developmental analysis. This was coupled with evidence for molecular integration and analysis of stable integration and desiccation inducible CRE-mediated excision. Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic introduction of this vector showed transient expression of GFP and induced somatic embryogenesis in maize B73 and sorghum P898012 explants. Subjection to desiccation stress in tissue culture enabled the excision of CRE, WUS, and BBM, leaving the UBI M::GFP cassette and allowing subsequent plant regeneration and GFP expression analysis. Stable GFP expression was observed in the early and late somatic embryos, young shoots, vegetative plant organs, and pollen. Transgene integration and expression of GFP positive T0 plants were also analyzed using PCR and Southern blots. Progeny segregation analysis of primary events confirmed correlation between functional GFP expression and presence of the GFP transgene in T1 plants generated from self pollinations, indicating good transgene inheritance. This study confirms and extends the use of morphogenic regulators to overcome transformation barriers."
28715485,aflatoxin level,Characterization of the maize lipoxygenase gene family in relation to aflatoxin accumulation resistance,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a globally important staple food crop prone to contamination by aflatoxin, a carcinogenic secondary metabolite produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus. An efficient approach to reduce accumulation of aflatoxin is the development of germplasm resistant to colonization and toxin production by A. flavus. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a group of non-heme iron containing dioxygenase enzymes that catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LOX derived oxylipins play critical roles in plant defense against pathogens including A. flavus. The objectives of this study were to summarize sequence diversity and expression patterns for all LOX genes in the maize genome, and map their effect on aflatoxin accumulation via linkage and association mapping. In total, 13 LOX genes were identified, characterized, and mapped. The sequence of one gene, ZmLOX10, is reported from 5 inbred lines. Genes ZmLOX1/2, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 12 (GRMZM2G156861, or V4 numbers ZM00001D042541 and Zm00001D042540, GRMZM2G102760, GRMZM2G104843, GRMZM2G017616, GRMZM2G015419, and GRMZM2G106748, respectively) fell under previously published QTL in one or more mapping populations and are linked to a measurable reduction of aflatoxin in maize grains. Association mapping results found 28 of the 726 SNPs tested were associated with reduced aflatoxin levels at p &#8804; 9.71 x 10-4 according to association statistics. These fell within or near nine of the ZmLOX genes. This work confirms the importance of some lipoxygenases for resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and may be used to direct future genetic selection in maize."
28722229,response to Gibberella stalk rot,A transposon-directed epigenetic change in ZmCCT underlies quantitative resistance to Gibberella stalk rot in maize,"A major resistance quantitative trait locus, qRfg1, significantly enhances maize resistance to Gibberella stalk rot, a devastating disease caused by Fusarium graminearum. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown.<p>  We adopted a map-based cloning approach to identify the resistance gene at qRfg1 and examined the dynamic epigenetic changes during qRfg1-mediated maize resistance to the disease.<p> A CCT domain-containing gene, ZmCCT, is the causal gene at the qRfg1 locus and a polymorphic CACTA-like transposable element (TE1) c. 2.4 kb upstream of ZmCCT is the genetic determinant of allelic variation. The non-TE1 ZmCCT allele is in a poised state, with predictive bivalent chromatin enriched for both repressive (H3K27me3/H3K9me3) and active (H3K4me3) histone marks. Upon pathogen challenge, this non-TE1 ZmCCT allele was promptly induced by a rapid yet transient reduction in H3K27me3/H3K9me3 and a progressive decrease in H3K4me3, leading to disease resistance. However, TE1 insertion in ZmCCT caused selective depletion of H3K4me3 and enrichment of methylated GC to suppress the pathogen-induced ZmCCT expression, resulting in disease susceptibility. Moreover, ZmCCT-mediated resistance to Gibberella stalk rot is not affected by photoperiod sensitivity.<p>  This chromatin-based regulatory mechanism enables ZmCCT to be more precise and timely in defense against F. graminearum infection."
28729714,days to flowering,Maize (Zea mays L.) genome size indicated by 180-bp knob abundance is associated with flowering time,"Flowering time is considered one of the most important agronomic traits in maize (Zea mays L.), and previous studies have indicated that this trait is correlated with genome size. We observed a significant difference in genome size between tropical and temperate inbred lines and a moderate positive correlation between genome size and 180-bp knob abundance determined by high-throughput sequencing in maize inbred lines in this study. We assembled the reads that were mapped to 180-bp knob sequences and found that the top ten abundant 180-bp knob sequences are highly variable. Moreover, our results indicate that genome size is associated with the flowering time of both male and female flowers, in both tropical and temperate inbred lines and under both tropical and temperate environments. To identify loci associated with genome size, we performed a genome-wide association study. The analysis identified three genomic regions associated with genome size, of which two were novel while the third one is located close to the known knobs K8L1 and K8L2. Overall, our results indicate that selection for breeding materials with earlier flowering times can be assisted by choosing germplasms with smaller genome sizes and that genome size can be determined based on the abundance of 180-bp knobs."
28730636,drought response,The reduction in maize leaf growth under mild drought affects the transition between cell division and cell expansion and cannot be restored by elevated gibberellic acid levels,"Growth is characterized by the interplay between cell division and cell expansion, two processes that occur separated along the growth zone at the maize leaf. To gain further insight into the transition between cell division and cell expansion, conditions were investigated in which the position of this transition zone was positively or negatively affected. High levels of gibberellic acid (GA) in plants overexpressing the GA biosynthesis gene GA20-OXIDASE (GA20OX-1OE ) shifted the transition zone more distally, whereas mild drought, which is associated with lowered GA biosynthesis, resulted in a more basal positioning. However, the increased levels of GA in the GA20OX-1OE line were insufficient to convey tolerance to the mild drought treatment, indicating that another mechanism in addition to lowered GA levels is restricting growth during drought. Transcriptome analysis with high spatial resolution indicated that mild drought specifically induces a reprogramming of transcriptional regulation in the division zone. ""Leaf Growth Viewer"" was developed as an online searchable tool containing the high-resolution data."
28733421,response to cold stress,Differentially regulated orthologs in Sorghum and the subgenomes of maize,"Identifying interspecies changes in gene regulation, one of the two primary sources of phenotypic variation, is challenging on a genome-wide scale. The use of paired time course data on cold-responsive gene expression in maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) allowed us to identify differentially regulated orthologs. While the majority of cold-responsive transcriptional regulation of conserved gene pairs is species specific, the initial transcriptional responses to cold appear to be more conserved than later responses. In maize, the promoters of genes with conserved transcriptional responses to cold tend to contain more micrococcal nuclease hypersensitive sites in their promoters, a proxy for open chromatin. Genes with conserved patterns of transcriptional regulation between the two species show lower ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, known to be involved in cold acclimation, tended to show consistent regulation in both species. Genes with species-specific cold responses did not cluster in particular pathways nor were they enriched in particular functional categories. We propose that cold-responsive transcriptional regulation in individual species may not be a reliable marker for function, while a core set of genes involved in perceiving and responding to cold stress are subject to functionally constrained cold-responsive regulation across the grass tribe Andropogoneae."
28774930,Flowering,Genomic estimation of complex traits reveals ancient maize adaptation to temperate North America,"By 4000 years ago, people had introduced maize to the southwestern United States; full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland deserts but delayed in the temperate highlands for 2000 years. We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. Temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation."
28818369,plant height,Brassinosteroid and Gibberellin control of seedling traits in maize (Zea mays L.),"In this study, we established two doubled haploid (DH) libraries with a total of 207 DH lines. We applied BR and GA inhibitors to all DH lines at seedling stage and measured seedling BR and GA inhibitor responses. Moreover, we evaluated field traits for each DH line (untreated). We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with 62,049 genome wide SNPs to explore the genetic control of seedling traits by BR and GA. In addition, we correlate seedling stage hormone inhibitor response with field traits. Large variation for BR and GA inhibitor response and field traits was observed across these DH lines. Seedling stage BR and GA inhibitor response was significantly correlate with yield and flowering time. Using three different GWAS approaches to balance false positive/negatives, multiple SNPs were discovered to be significantly associated with BR/GA inhibitor responses with some localized within gene models. SNPs from gene model GRMZM2G013391 were associated with GA inhibitor response across all three GWAS models. This gene is expressed in roots and shoots and was shown to regulate GA signaling. These results show that BRs and GAs have a great impact for controlling seedling growth. Gene models from GWAS results could be targets for seeding traits improvement."
28837076,kernel development,iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis and network integration for kernel tissue development in maize,"Grain weight is one of the most important yield components and a developmentally complex structure comprised of two major compartments (endosperm and pericarp) in maize (Zea mays L.), however, very little is known concerning the coordinated accumulation of the numerous proteins involved. Herein, we used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based comparative proteomic method to analyze the characteristics of dynamic proteomics for endosperm and pericarp during grain development. Totally, 9539 proteins were identified for both components at four development stages, among which 1401 proteins were non-redundant, 232 proteins were specific in pericarp and 153 proteins were specific in endosperm. A functional annotation of the identified proteins revealed the importance of metabolic and cellular processes, and binding and catalytic activities for the tissue development. Three and 76 proteins involved in 49 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were integrated for the specific endosperm and pericarp proteins, respectively, reflecting their complex metabolic interactions. In addition, four proteins with important functions and different expression levels were chosen for gene cloning and expression analysis. Different concordance between mRNA level and the protein abundance was observed across different proteins, stages, and tissues as in previous research. These results could provide useful message for understanding the developmental mechanisms in grain development in maize."
28838954,plant height,The genetic basis of plant architecture in 10 maize recombinant inbred line populations,"Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize.	However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic	backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and  minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant  architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one  population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and  the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The number and effect of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which in turn correlates  positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (61.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which have previously been shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to co-localize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the RIL populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, qPH3, has been fine-mapped to a 600-Kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding."
28874047,kernel composition,Concentration of beneficial phytochemicals in harvested grain of us yellow dent maize (Zea mays L.) germplasm,"Although previous studies have examined the concentration of various nutritional compounds in maize, little focus has been devoted to the study of commercial maize hybrids or their inbred parents. In this study, a genetically and phenotypically diverse set of maize hybrids and inbreds relevant to U.S. commercial maize germplasm was evaluated for its variability in phytochemical content. Total protein, unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols, soluble phenolics, and insoluble-bound phenolics were evaluated in this study. Of these compounds, only soluble and insoluble-bound phenolic acids exhibited means and variances that were at least as large as the means and variances reported for other sets of germplasm. This suggests that selection for high phenolic acid content is possible in current U.S. commercial germplasm. In contrast, while the total protein, unsaturated fatty acid, or tocopherol content could possibly be improved using current U.S. commercial germplasm, the results of this study indicate that the incorporation of more diverse sources of germplasm would most likely result in quicker genetic gains."
28877341,insect response,Fine-tuning the 'plant domestication-reduced defense' hypothesis: specialist vs generalist herbivores,"Domesticated plants are assumed to have weakened chemical defenses. We argue, however, that artificial selection will have maintained defense traits against specialized herbivores that have coexisted with the crops throughout their domestication. We assessed the performance of eight species of insect herbivores from three feeding guilds on six European maize lines and six populations of their wild ancestor, teosinte. A metabolomics approach was used in an attempt to identify compounds responsible for observed differences in insect performance. Insects consistently performed better on maize than on teosinte. As hypothesized, this difference was greater for generalist herbivores that are normally not found on teosinte. We also found clear differences in defense metabolites among the different genotypes, but none that consistently correlated with differences in performance. Concentrations of benzoxazinoids, the main chemical defense in maize, tended to be higher in leaves of teosinte, but the reverse was true for the roots. It appears that chemical defenses that target specialized insects are still present at higher concentrations in cultivated maize than compounds that are more effective against generalists. These weakened broad-spectrum defenses in crops may explain the successes of novel pests."
28952420,response to Setosphaeria turcica Wisser 2011,Determinants of virulence and in vitro development colocalize on a genetic map of Setosphaeria turcica,"Generating effective and stable strategies for resistance breeding requires an understanding of the genetics of host-pathogen interactions and the implications for pathogen dynamics and evolution. Setosphaeria turcica causes northern leaf blight (NLB), an important disease of maize for which major resistance genes have been deployed. Little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of avirulence (AVR) genes in S. turcica. To test the hypothesis that there is a genetic association between avirulence and in vitro development traits, we (i) created a genetic map of S. turcica, (ii) located candidate AVRHt1 and AVRHt2 regions, and (iii) identified genetic regions associated with several in vitro development traits. A cross was generated between a race 1 and a race 23N strain, and 221 progeny were isolated. Genotyping by sequencing was used to score 2,078 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. A genetic map spanning 1,981 centimorgans was constructed, consisting of 21 linkage groups. Genetic mapping extended prior evidence for the location and identity of the AVRHt1 gene and identified a region of interest for AVRHt2. The genetic location of AVRHt2 colocalized with loci influencing radial growth and mycelial abundance. Our data suggest a trade-off between virulence on Ht1 and Ht2 and the pathogen's vegetative growth rate. In addition, in-depth analysis of the genotypic data suggests the presence of significant duplication in the genome of S. turcica."
29044609,stomatal conductance,Phenomics allows identification of genomic regions affecting maize stomatal conductance with conditional effects of water deficit and evaporative demand,"Stomatal conductance is central for the trades-off between hydraulics and photosynthesis. We aimed at deciphering its genetic control and that of its responses to evaporative demand and water deficit, a nearly impossible task with gas exchanges measurements. Whole-plant stomatal conductance was estimated via inversion of the Penman Monteith equation from data of transpiration and plant architecture collected in a phenotyping platform. We have analyzed jointly four experiments with contrasting environmental conditions imposed to a panel of 254 maize hybrids. Estimated whole-plant stomatal conductance closely correlated with gas-exchange measurements and biomass accumulation rate. Sixteen robust quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS), and co-located with QTLs of transpiration and biomass. Light, vapour pressure deficit or soil water potential largely accounted for the differences in allelic effects between experiments, thereby providing strong hypotheses for mechanisms of stomatal control and a way to select relevant candidate genes among the 1-19 genes harboured by QTLs. The combination of allelic effects as affected by environmental conditions accounted for the variability of stomatal conductance across a range of hybrids and environmental conditions. This approach may therefore contribute to genetic analysis and prediction of stomatal control in diverse environments."
29054859,sulfur use efficiency,Quality protein maize based on reducing Sulfur in leaf cells,"Low levels of the essential amino acids lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) in a maize-based diet are a major cost to feed and food. Lys deficiency is due to the abundance of Lys-poor proteins in maize kernels. Although a maize mutant, opaque-2 (o2), has sufficient levels of Lys, its soft kernel renders it unfit for storage and transportation. Breeders overcame this problem by selecting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) restoring kernel hardness in the presence of o2, a variety called Quality Protein Maize (QPM). Although at least one QTL acts by enhancing the expression of the &#947;-zein proteins, we could surprisingly achieve rebalancing of the Lys content and a vitreous kernel phenotype by targeting suppression of &#947;-zeins without the o2 mutant. Reduced levels of &#947;-zeins were achieved with RNA interference (RNAi). Another transgenic event, PE5 expresses the Escherichia coli enzyme 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase involved in sulfate assimilation, specifically in leaves. The stacked transgenic events produce a vitreous endosperm, which has higher Lys level than the classical opaque W64Ao2 variant. Moreover, due to the increased sulfate reduction in the leaf, Met level is elevated in the seed. Such a combination of transgenes produces hybrid seeds superior to classical QPMs that would neither require a costly feed mix nor synthetic Met supplementation, potentially creating a novel and cost-effective means for improving maize nutritional quality."
29062086,haploid production,Single nucleus sequencing reveals spermatid chromosome fragmentation as a possible cause of maize haploid induction,"Production of maternal haploids using a conspecific haploid inducer is routine and highly efficient in maize. However, the underlying mechanism of haploid induction (HI) is unclear. We develop a method to isolate three nuclei from a pollen grain and four microspores from a tetrad for whole-genome sequencing. A high rate of aneuploidy is observed at the three-nucleus stage (6/22 pollens) rather than at the tetrad stage (1/72 microspores) in one HI line CAU5. Frequent aneuploidy is also observed in another two inducer lines, but not in two regular lines, which implies that HI may be associated with pollen aneuploidy. We further sequence the individual embryos and endosperms of 88 maize kernels crossing between regular and inducer lines. Genome-wide elimination of the CAU5-derived chromosome is identified in eight of 81 embryos. Together, these results suggest that continuous chromosome fragmentation occurring post meiosis in the gametophyte may cause haploidy of the embryo."
29075283,response to Fusarium ear rot,Molecular basis of resistance to Fusarium ear rot in maize,"The impact of climate change has been identified as an emerging issue for food security and safety, and the increased incidence of mycotoxin contamination in maize over the last two decades is considered a potential emerging hazard. Disease control by chemical and agronomic approaches is often ineffective and increases the cost of production; for this reason the exploitation of genetic resistance is the most sustainable method for reducing contamination. The review focuses on the significant advances that have been made in the development of transcriptomic, genetic and genomic information for maize, Fusarium verticillioides molds, and their interactions, over recent years. Findings from transcriptomic studies have been used to outline a specific model for the intracellular signaling cascade occurring in maize cells against F. verticillioides infection. Several recognition receptors, such as receptor-like kinases and R genes, are involved in pathogen perception, and trigger down-stream signaling networks mediated by mitogen-associated protein kinases. These signals could be orchestrated primarily by hormones, including salicylic acid, auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid, in association with calcium signaling, targeting multiple transcription factors that in turn promote the down-stream activation of defensive response genes, such as those related to detoxification processes, phenylpropanoid, and oxylipin metabolic pathways. At the genetic and genomic levels, several quantitative trait loci (QTL) and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers for resistance to Fusarium ear rot deriving from QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies are described, indicating the complexity of this polygenic trait. All these findings will contribute to identifying candidate genes for resistance and to applying genomic technologies for selecting resistant maize genotypes and speeding up a strategy of breeding to contrast disease, through plants resistant to mycotoxin-producing pathogens."
29132306,response to Cercospora,"RNA-Seq analysis of resistant and susceptible sub-tropical maize lines reveals a role for kauralexins in resistance to grey leaf spot disease, caused by Cercospora zeina","Background: Cercospora zeina is a foliar pathogen responsible for maize grey leaf spot in southern Africa that negatively impacts maize production. Plants use a variety of chemical and structural mechanisms to defend themselves against invading pathogens such as C. zeina, including the production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties. In maize, a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors induce the accumulation of the terpenoid phytoalexins, zealexins and kauralexins.<p> Results: C. zeina-susceptible line displayed pervasive rectangular grey leaf spot lesions, running parallel with the leaf veins in contrast to C. zeina-resistant line that had restricted disease symptoms. Analysis of the transcriptome of both lines indicated that genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism were up-regualted, and although different pathways were prioritized in each line, production of terpenoid compounds were common to both. Targeted phytoalexin analysis revealed that C. zeina-inoculated leaves accumulated zealexins and kauralexins. The resistant line shows a propensity toward accumulation of the kauralexin B series metabolites in response to infection, which contrasts with the susceptible line that preferentially accumulates the kauralexin A series. Kauralexin accumulation was correlated to expression of the kauralexin biosynthetic gene, ZmAn2 and a candidate biosynthetic gene, ZmKSL2. We report the expression of a putative copalyl diphosphate synthase gene that is induced by C. zeina in the resistant line exclusively.<p> Discussion: This study shows that zealexins and kauralexins, and expression of their biosynthetic genes, are induced by C. zeina in both resistant and susceptible germplasm adapted to the southern African climate. The data presented here indicates that different forms of kauralexins accumulate in the resistant and susceptible maize lines in response to C. zeina, with the accumulation of kauralexin B compounds in a resistant maize line and kauralexin A compounds accumulating in the susceptible line."
29139111,salinity tolerance; response to salt,A retrotransposon in an HKT1 family sodium transporter causes variation of leaf Na+ exclusion and salt tolerance in maize,"Soil salinity is one of several major abiotic stresses that constrain maize productivity worldwide. An improved understanding of salt-tolerance mechanisms will thus enhance the breeding of salt-tolerant maize and boost productivity. Previous studies have indicated that the maintenance of leaf Na+ concentration is essential for maize salt tolerance, and the difference in leaf Na+ exclusion has previously been associated with variation in salt tolerance between maize varieties.<p>     Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a maize salt-tolerance quantitative trait locus (QTL), Zea mays Na+ Content1 (ZmNC1), which encodes an HKT-type transporter (designated as ZmHKT1).<p>     We show that a natural ZmHKT1 loss-of-function allele containing a retrotransposon insertion confers increased accumulation of Na+ in leaves, and salt hypersensitivity. We next show that ZmHKT1 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Na+-selective transporter, and is preferentially expressed in root stele (including the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels). We also show that loss of ZmHKT1 function increases xylem sap Na+ concentration and causes increased root-to-shoot Na+ delivery, indicating that ZmHKT1 promotes leaf Na+ exclusion and salt tolerance by withdrawing Na+ from the xylem sap.<p>     We conclude that ZmHKT1 is a major salt-tolerance QTL and identifies an important new gene target in breeding for improved maize salt tolerance."
29143067,grain quality,Characterization and fine mapping of qkc7.03: a major locus for kernel cracking in maize,"A major locus conferring kernel cracking in maize was characterized and fine mapped to an interval of 416.27 kb. Meanwhile, combining the results of transcriptomic analysis, the candidate gene was inferred. Seed development requires a proper structural and physiological balance between the maternal tissues and the internal structures of the seeds. In maize, kernel cracking is a disorder in this balance that seriously limits quality and yield and is characterized by a cracked pericarp at the kernel top and endosperm everting. This study elucidated the genetic basis and characterization of kernel cracking. Primarily, a near isogenic line (NIL) with a B73 background exhibited steady kernel cracking across environments. Therefore, deprived mapping populations were developed from this NIL and its recurrent parent B73. A major locus on chromosome 7, qkc7.03, was identified to be associated with the cracking performance. According to a progeny test of recombination events, qkc7.03 was fine mapped to a physical interval of 416.27 kb. In addition, obvious differences were observed in embryo development and starch granule arrangement within the endosperm between the NIL and its recurrent parent upon the occurrence of kernel cracking. Moreover, compared to its recurrent parent, the transcriptome of the NIL showed a significantly down-regulated expression of genes related to zeins, carbohydrate synthesis and MADS-domain transcription factors. The transcriptomic analysis revealed ten annotated genes within the target region of qkc7.03, and only GRMZM5G899476 was differently expressed between the NIL and its recurrent parent, indicating that this gene might be a candidate gene for kernel cracking. The results of this study facilitate the understanding of the potential mechanism underlying kernel cracking in maize."
29150689,anthesis-silking interval,Distinct genetic architectures for phenotype means and plasticities in Zea mays,"Phenotypic plasticity describes the phenotypic variation of a trait when a genotype is exposed to different environments. Understanding the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity in crops such as maize is of paramount importance for maintaining and increasing yields in a world experiencing climate change. Here, we report the results of genome-wide association analyses of multiple phenotypes and two measures of phenotypic plasticity in a maize nested association mapping (US-NAM) population grown in multiple environments and genotyped with ~2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We show that across all traits the candidate genes for mean phenotype values and plasticity measures form structurally and functionally distinct groups. Such independent genetic control suggests that breeders will be able to select semi-independently for mean phenotype values and plasticity, thereby generating varieties with both high mean phenotype values and levels of plasticity that are appropriate for the target performance environments."
29151152,response to western corn rootworm,"A maize inbred exhibits resistance against western corn rootwoorm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera","Insect resistance against root herbivores like the western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) is not well understood in non-transgenic maize. We studied the responses of two American maize inbreds, Mp708 and Tx601, to WCR infestation using biomechanical, molecular, biochemical analyses, and laser ablation tomography. Previous studies performed on several inbreds indicated that these two maize genotypes differed in resistance to pests including fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and WCR. Our data confirmed that Mp708 shows resistance against WCR, and demonstrates that the resistance mechanism is based in a multi-trait phenotype that includes increased resistance to cutting in nodal roots, stable root growth during insect infestation, constitutive and induced expression of known herbivore-defense genes, including ribosomal inhibitor protein 2 (rip2), terpene synthase 23 (tps23) and maize insect resistance cysteine protease-1 (mir1), as well high constitutive levels of jasmonic acid and production of (E)-&#946;-caryophyllene. In contrast, Tx601 is susceptible to WCR. These findings will facilitate the use of Mp708 as a model to explore the wide variety of mechanisms and traits involved in plant defense responses and resistance to herbivory by insects with several different feeding habits"
29195231,response to salt,Early response to salt ions in maize (Zea mays L.),"Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates leaf growth and transpiration rate of plants exposed to salt stress. Despite the known fact that cell dehydration is instrumental for the modulation of ABA concentrations when NaCl is high in the external environment, it was never tested as to whether sodium (Na) or chlorine (Cl) also modulate ABA concentrations. To answer this question, a hydroponic study on maize (Zea mays) was established, by exposing plants to 50mM of sodium glucosamide or glucosamine chloride. The effect of both ions on ABA was investigated in an early stage before (i) the salt ions accumulated to toxic tissue concentrations and before (ii) cells dehydrated. This allowed studying early responses to Na and Cl separately, well before plants were stressed by these ions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify ABA concentrations in roots and in leaves after a period of 2h after ion application. The transcript abundance of the key regulatory enzyme of the biosynthesis of ABA in maize, the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene viviparous 14, was quantified via real-time quantitative-reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. The results reveal that Cl and Na induce the increase of leaf tissue ABA concentrations at two hours after plants were exposed to 50mM of the ions. Surprisingly, this effect was more pronounced in response to the Cl component. The increase in the guard-cell regulating ABA concentration correlated with a reduced transpiration. Mainly because of this result we suggest that the early accumulation of ABA is useful in maintaining cell turgor."
29202693,response to Rhizoctonia solani,Functional analysis of the GRMZM2G174449 promoter to identify Rhizoctonia solani-inducible cis-elements in maize,"BACKGROUND: Banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB), caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is a highly devastating disease in most maize and rice growing areas of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms of perceiving pathogen signals are poorly understood in hosts.<p> RESULTS: Here, we identified a Rhizoctonia solani-inducible promoter pGRMZM2G174449 in maize. Deletion analysis showed that the -574 to -455 fragment was necessary for pGRMZM2G174449 in responding to R. solani and this fragment contained the unknown pathogen-inducible cis-elements according to the bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, detailed quantitative assays showed that two cis-elements, GCTGA in the -567 to -563 region and TATAT in the -485 to -481 region, were specifically responsible for the R. solani-inducible activity. A series of point mutation analysis indicated that the two cis-elements have the conserved motifs of NHWGN and DWYWT, respectively.<p> CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that pGRMZM2G174449 is a good R. solani-inducible promoter suitable for genetic engineering of BLSB resistance. And NHWGN and DWYWT are two R. solani-inducible cis-elements that play important roles in pGRMZM2G174449 responding to R. solani."
29228374,response to western corn rootworm,Quantitative trait loci mapping of Western corn rootworm (coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) host plant resistance in two populations of doubled haploid lines in maize (Zea mays L.),"Over the last 70 yr, more than 12,000 maize accessions have been screened for their level of resistance to western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (LeConte; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), larval feeding. Less than 1% of this germplasm was selected for initiating recurrent selection or other breeding programs. Selected genotypes were mostly characterized by large root systems and superior root regrowth after root damage caused by western corn rootworm larvae. However, no hybrids claiming native (i.e., host plant) resistance to western corn rootworm larval feeding are currently commercially available. We investigated the genetic basis of western corn rootworm resistance in maize materials with improved levels of resistance using linkage disequilibrium mapping approaches. Two populations of topcrossed doubled haploid maize lines (DHLs) derived from crosses between resistant and susceptible maize lines were evaluated for their level of resistance in three to four different environments. For each DHL topcross an average root damage score was estimated and used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We found genomic regions contributing to western corn rootworm resistance on all maize chromosomes, except for chromosome 4. Models fitting all QTL simultaneously explained about 30 to 50% of the genotypic variance for root damage scores in both mapping populations. Our findings confirm the complex genetic structure of host plant resistance against western corn rootworm larval feeding in maize. Interestingly, three of these QTL regions also carry genes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis, a key compound we hypothesize is involved in the expression of western corn rootworm resistance."
29232707,leaf width,Genetic mapping of QTL for maize leaf width combining RIL and IF2 populations,"Leaf width is an important component of plant architecture that affects light capture during photosynthesis and wind circulation under dense planting conditions. To improve understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in leaf width at different positions, a comprehensive evaluation using the RIL (Recombinant Inbred Line) and IF2 (Immortalized F2) populations and a subsequent meta-analysis were performed. Forty-seven QTL associated with leaf width at different positions below the tassel were detected. The individual effects of QTL explained 3.5% to 17.0% of the observed phenotypic variation, and ten QTL explained over 10%. The initial QTL were integrated into eight mQTL (meta-QTL) through a meta-analysis. Our results suggested that leaf widths at different positions may be affected by several of the same mQTL and may also be regulated by many different mQTL. These results provide useful information for breeding high density tolerant inbred lines and hybrid cultivars, as well as for using marker-assisted selection for important mQTL."
29259121,response to Bipolaris zeicola,Fungal-induced protein hyperacetylation in maize identified by acetylome profiling,"Lysine acetylation is a key posttranslational modification that regulates diverse proteins involved in a range of biological processes. The role of histone acetylation in plant defense is well established, and it is known that pathogen effector proteins encoding acetyltransferases can directly acetylate host proteins to alter immunity. However, it is unclear whether endogenous plant enzymes can modulate protein acetylation during an immune response. Here, we investigate how the effector molecule HC-toxin (HCT), a histone deacetylase inhibitor produced by the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum race 1, promotes virulence in maize through altering protein acetylation. Using mass spectrometry, we globally quantified the abundance of 3,636 proteins and the levels of acetylation at 2,791 sites in maize plants treated with HCT as well as HCT-deficient or HCT-producing strains of C. carbonum. Analyses of these data demonstrate that acetylation is a widespread posttranslational modification impacting proteins encoded by many intensively studied maize genes. Furthermore, the application of exogenous HCT enabled us to show that the activity of plant-encoded enzymes (histone deacetylases) can be modulated to alter acetylation of nonhistone proteins during an immune response. Collectively, these results provide a resource for further mechanistic studies examining the regulation of protein function by reversible acetylation and offer insight into the complex immune response triggered by virulent C. carbonum."
29260396,response to Aspergillus flavus; response to Rhizopus microsporus,"Fungal and herbivore elicitation of the novel maize sesquiterpenoid, zealexin A4, is attenuated by elevated CO2","Chemical isolation and NMR-based structure elucidation revealed a novel keto-acidic sesquiterpenoid, termed zealexin A4 (ZA4). ZA4 is elicited by pathogens and herbivory, but attenuated by heightened levels of CO 2 . The identification of the labdane-related diterpenoids, termed kauralexins and acidic sesquiterpenoids, termed zealexins, demonstrated the existence of at least ten novel stress-inducible maize metabolites with diverse antimicrobial activity. Despite these advances, the identity of co-occurring and predictably related analytes remains largely unexplored. In the current effort, we identify and characterize the first sesquiterpene keto acid derivative of &#946;-macrocarpene, named zealexin A4 (ZA4). Evaluation of diverse maize inbreds revealed that ZA4 is commonly produced in maize scutella during the first 14 days of seedling development; however, ZA4 production in the scutella was markedly reduced in seedlings grown in sterile soil. Elevated ZA4 production was observed in response to inoculation with adventitious fungal pathogens, such as Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus microsporus, and a positive relationship between ZA4 production and expression of the predicted zealexin biosynthetic genes, terpene synthases 6 and 11 (Tps6 and Tps11), was observed. ZA4 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the mycotoxigenic pathogen A. flavus; however, ZA4 activity against R. microsporus was minimal, suggesting the potential of some fungi to detoxify ZA4. Significant induction of ZA4 production was also observed in response to infestation with the stem tunneling herbivore Ostrinia nubilalis. Examination of the interactive effects of elevated CO2 (E-CO2) on both fungal and herbivore-elicited ZA4 production revealed significantly reduced levels of inducible ZA4 accumulation, consistent with a negative role for E-CO2 on ZA4 production. Collectively, these results describe a novel &#946;-macrocarpene-derived antifungal defense in maize and expand the established diversity of zealexins that are differentially regulated in response to biotic/abiotic stress."
29287150,response to maize chlorotic mottle virus,Diverse chromosomal locations of quantitative trait loci for tolerance to maize chlorotic mottle virus in five maize populations,"The recent rapid emergence of maize lethal necrosis (MLN), caused by coinfection of maize with maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a second virus usually from the family Potyviridae, is causing extensive losses for farmers in East Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. Although the genetic basis of resistance to potyviruses is well understood in maize, little was known about resistance to MCMV. The responses of five maize inbred lines (KS23-5, KS23-6, N211, DR and Oh1VI) to inoculation with MCMV, sugarcane mosaic virus and MLN were characterized. All five lines developed fewer symptoms than susceptible controls after inoculation with MCMV; however, the virus was detected in systemic leaf tissue from each of the lines similarly to susceptible controls, indicating the lines were tolerant of MCMV rather than resistant to it. Except for KS23-5, the inbred lines also developed fewer symptoms after inoculation with MLN than susceptible controls. To identify genetic loci associated with MCMV tolerance, large F2 or recombinant inbred populations were evaluated for their phenotypic responses to MCMV and the most resistant and susceptible plants were genotyped by sequencing. One to four quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in each tolerant population using recombination frequency and positional mapping strategies. In contrast to previous studies of virus resistance in maize, the chromosomal positions and genetic character of the QTL were unique to each population. The results suggest different, genotype specific, mechanisms are associated with MCMV tolerance in maize. These results will allow for the development of markers for marker-assisted selection of MCMV and MLN tolerant maize hybrids for disease control."
29293391,response to armyworm,A role for 9-lipoxygenases in maize defense against insect herbivory,"Feeding by Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) larvae on Zea mays (maize) induces expression of 9-lipoxygenases to a greater extent than 13-lipoxygenases. Whereas 13-lipoxygenases have an established role in the synthesis of jasmonates that serve as defense signaling molecules in many plant species, relatively little is known about the role of 9-lipoxygenases in herbivore defense. Phylogenetic analysis of lipoxygenases from maize inbred lines B73 and W22 shows that, although most Lox genes are present in both lines, Lox12, a 9-lipoxygenase that has been implicated in fungal defense, is truncated and unlikely to encode a functional protein in W22. Two independent Mutator transposon insertions in another 9-lipoxygenase, Lox4, caused improved S. exigua growth on the mutant lines relative to wildtype W22. This observation suggests a function in herbivore defense for metabolic products downstream of maize Lox4, either through direct toxicity or a perhaps an as yet unknown signaling function."
29317538,root development,Growth is required for perception of water availability to pattern root branches in plants,"Water availability is a potent regulator of plant development and induces root branching through a process termed hydropatterning. Hydropatterning enables roots to position lateral branches toward regions of high water availability, such as wet soil or agar media, while preventing their emergence where water is less available, such as in air. The mechanism by which roots perceive the spatial distribution of water during hydropatterning is unknown. Using primary roots of Zea mays (maize) we reveal that developmental competence for hydropatterning is limited to the growth zone of the root tip. Past work has shown that growth generates gradients in water potential across an organ when asymmetries exist in the distribution of available water. Using mathematical modeling, we predict that substantial growth-sustained water potential gradients are also generated in the hydropatterning competent zone and that such biophysical cues inform the patterning of lateral roots. Using diverse chemical and environmental treatments we experimentally demonstrate that growth is necessary for normal hydropatterning of lateral roots. Transcriptomic characterization of the local response of tissues to a moist surface or air revealed extensive regulation of signaling and physiological pathways, some of which we show are growth-dependent. Our work supports a ""sense-by-growth"" mechanism governing hydropatterning, by which water availability cues are rendered interpretable through growth-sustained water movement."
29344831,response to abscisic acid,Interaction network of core ABA signaling components in maize,"We defined a comprehensive core ABA signaling network in monocot maize, including the gene expression, subcellular localization and interaction network of ZmPYLs, ZmPP2Cs, ZmSnRK2s and the putative substrates. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant developmental processes and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, ABA is sensed by the PYL ABA receptors, which leads to binding of the PP2C protein phosphatase and activation of the SnRK2 protein kinases. These components functioning diversely and redundantly in ABA signaling are little known in maize. Using Arabidopsis pyl112458 and snrk2.2/3/6 mutants, we identified several ABA-responsive ZmPYLs and ZmSnRK2s, and also ZmPP2Cs. We showed the gene expression, subcellular localization and interaction network of ZmPYLs, ZmPP2Cs, and ZmSnRK2s, and the isolation of putative ZmSnRK2 substrates by mass spectrometry in monocot maize. We found that the ABA dependency of PYL-PP2C interactions is contingent on the identity of the PP2Cs. Among 238 candidate substrates for ABA-activated protein kinases, 69 are putative ZmSnRK2 substrates. Besides homologs of previously reported putative AtSnRK2 substrates, 23 phosphoproteins have not been discovered in the dicot Arabidopsis. Thus, we have defined a comprehensive core ABA signaling network in monocot maize and shed new light on ABA signaling."
29362081,root morphology,Genome-wide association studies of doubled haploid exotic introgression lines for root system architecture traits in maize (Zea mays L.),"Root system architecture (RSA) is becoming recognized as important for water and nutrient acquisition in plants. This study focuses on finding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with seedling RSA traits from 300 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from crosses between Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) accessions and inbred lines PHB47 and PHZ51. These DH lines were genotyped using 62,077 SNP markers, while root and shoot phenotype data were collected from 14-day old seedlings. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted using three models to offset false positives/negatives. Multiple SNPs associated with seedling root traits were detected, some of which were within or linked to gene models that showed expression in seedling roots. Significant trait associations involving the SNP S5_152926936 on Chromosome 5 were detected in all three models, particularly the trait network area. The SNP is within the gene model GRMZM2G021110, which is expressed in roots at seedling stage. SNPs that were significantly associated with seedling root traits, and closely linked to gene models that encode proteins associated with root development were also detected. This study shows that the GEM-DH panel may be a source of allelic diversity for genes controlling seedling root development."
29364547,root lodging,The genetic architecture of nodal root number in maize,"The maize nodal root system plays a crucial role in the development of the aboveground plant and determines the yield via the uptake of water and nutrients in the field. However, the genetic architecture of the maize nodal root system is not well understood, and it has become the 'dark matter' in maize genetics. Here, a large teosinte-maize population was analyzed, and high-resolution mapping revealed that 62 out of 133 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), accounting for approximately half of the total genetic variation in nodal root number, were derived from the QTLs for flowering time, which was further validated through a transgenic analysis and a genome-wide association study. However, only 16% of the total genetic variation in nodal root number was derived from QTLs for plant height. These results gave a hint that flowering time played a key role in shaping the nodal root number via indirect selection during maize domestication. Our results also supported that more aerial nodal roots and fewer crown roots might be favored in temperate maize, and this root architecture might efficiently improve root-lodging resistance and the ability to uptake deep water and nitrogen under dense planting."
29370369,gravitropism,Root cap-mediated evaluation of soil resistance towards graviresponding roots of maize (Zea mays L.) and the relevance of ethylene,"Background and Aims: Besides biological and chemical impacts, mechanical resistance represents an important obstacle that growing roots face. Graviresponding roots must assess the mechanical resistance of the substrate and take decisions on whether they change growth direction and grow around obstacles or tolerate growth conditions impaired to varying degrees. To test the significance of the root cap, we measured pressure and growth behaviour of single intact, as well as decapped, roots encountering diverse mechanical obstacles. We examined ethylene emission in intact roots as well as roots without a root cap, thereby lacking the capacity to deviate.<p> Methods: Roots of fixed seedlings were grown vertically onto diverse mechanical obstacles. Developing pressure profiles of vertically growing roots encountering horizontal mechanical obstacles were measured employing electronic milligram scales, with and without root caps in given local environmental conditions. The evolution of root-borne ethylene was measured in intact roots and roots without the root cap.<p> Key Results: In contrast to decapped roots, intact roots develop a tentative, short-lasting pressure profile, the resolution of which is characterized by a definite change of growth direction. Similarly, pressure profiles and strengths of roots facing gradually differing surface resistances differ significantly between the two. This correlates in the short term with root cap-dependent ethylene emission which is lacking in roots without caps.<p> Conclusions: The way gravistimulated and graviresponding roots cope with exogenous stimuli depends on whether and how they adapt to these impacts. With respect to mechanical hindrances, roots without caps do not seem to be able to evaluate soil strengths in order to respond adequately. On encountering resistance, roots with intact caps emit ethylene, which is not observed in decapped roots. It therefore appears that it is the root cap which specifically orchestrates the resistance needed to overcome mechanical resistance by specifically inducing ethylene."
29370753,cadmium content,Genome-wide association analysis and QTL mapping reveal the genetic control of cadmium accumulation in maize leaf,"BACKGROUND: Accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in maize (Zea mays L.) poses a significant risk to human health as it is ingested via the food chain. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in a population of 269 maize accessions with 43,737 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify candidate genes and favorable alleles for controlling Cd accumulation in maize.<p> RESULTS: When grown in contaminated soil, accessions varied significantly in leaf Cd concentration at both the seeding and maturing stages with phenotypic variation and the coefficient of variation all above 48%. The co-localized region between SYN27837 (147,034,650 bp) and SYN36598 (168,551,327 bp) on chromosome 2 was associated with leaf Cd under three soil conditions varying in Cd content in 2015 and 2016. The significant SNP (SYN25051) at position 161,275,547 could explained 27.1% of the phenotype variation. Through QTL mapping using the IBMSyn10 double haploid (DH) population, we validated the existence of a major QTL identified by GWAS; qLCd2 could explain the 39.8% average phenotype variation across the experiments. Expression of GRMZM2G175576 encoding a cadmium/zinc-transporting ATPase underlying the QTL was significantly increased in roots, stems and leaves of B73, a low Cd accumulation line in response to Cd stress.<p> CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic control of Cd accumulation and could aid rapid development of maize genotypes with low-Cd accumulation by manipulation of the favorable alleles."
29378820,carotenoid content,Genetic loci controlling carotenoid biosynthesis in diverse tropical maize lines,"The discovery and use of genetic markers associated with carotenoid levels can help to more effectively exploit the genetic potential of maize for provitamin A accumulation. Provitamin A carotenoids are classes of carotenoids that are precursors of vitamin A, an essential micronutrient in humans. Vitamin A deficiency is a global public health problem affecting millions of people, especially in developing countries. Maize is one of the most important staple crops targeted for provitamin A biofortification to help alleviate vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of maize endosperm carotenoids was conducted using a panel of 130 diverse yellow maize tropical inbred lines genotyped with Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) SNP markers. Numerous significant association signals co-localizing with the known carotenoid biosynthesis genes crtRB1, lcyE and ZEP1 were identified. The GWAS confirmed previously reported large effects of the two major carotenoid biosynthesis genes lcyE and crtRB1 In addition, significant novel associations were detected for several transcription factors (e.g. RING zinc finger domain and HLH DNA-binding domain super family proteins) that may be involved in regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in maize. When the GWAS was re-conducted by including the major effects of lcyE and crtRB1 genes as covariates, a SNP in a gene coding for an auxin response factor 20 transcription factor was identified which displayed an association with &#946;-carotene and provitamin A levels. Our study provides a foundation for design and implementation of genomics-assisted selection strategies for provitamin A maize breeding in tropical regions. Our results advance efforts towards identification of additional genes (and allelic variants) involved in the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in plants."
29426290,response to Gibberella ear rot,Transcriptome profiling of two maize inbreds with distinct responses to Gibberella ear rot disease to identify candidate resistance genes,"Background: Gibberella ear rot (GER) is one of the most economically important fungal diseases of maize in the temperate zone due to moldy grain contaminated with health threatening mycotoxins. To develop resistant genotypes and control the disease, understanding the host-pathogen interaction is essential.<p> Results: RNA-Seq-derived transcriptome profiles of fungal- and mock-inoculated developing kernel tissues of two maize inbred lines were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts and propose candidate genes mapping within GER resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL). A total of 1255 transcripts were significantly (P &#8804; 0.05) up regulated due to fungal infection in both susceptible and resistant inbreds. A greater number of transcripts were up regulated in the former (1174) than the latter (497) and increased as the infection progressed from 1 to 2 days after inoculation. Focusing on differentially expressed genes located within QTL regions for GER resistance, we identified 81 genes involved in membrane transport, hormone regulation, cell wall modification, cell detoxification, and biosynthesis of pathogenesis related proteins and phytoalexins as candidate genes contributing to resistance. Applying droplet digital PCR, we validated the expression profiles of a subset of these candidate genes from QTL regions contributed by the resistant inbred on chromosomes 1, 2 and 9.<p> Conclusion: By screening global gene expression profiles for differentially expressed genes mapping within resistance QTL regions, we have identified candidate genes for gibberella ear rot resistance on several maize chromosomes which could potentially lead to a better understanding of Fusarium resistance mechanisms."
29453091,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,Identification of miRNAs and their targets in maize in response to Sugarcane mosaic virus infection,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that play essential regulatory roles in plant development and environmental stress responses. Maize (Zea mays L.) is a global economically important food and forage crop. To date, a number of maize miRNAs have been identified as being involved in plant development and stress responses. However, the miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks responsive to virus infections in maize remain largely unknown. In this study, the profiles of small RNAs in buffer- and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV)-inoculated maize plants were obtained by high-throughput sequencing, respectively. A total of 154 known miRNAs and 213 novel miRNAs were profiled and most of the miRNAs identified were differentially expressed after SCMV infection. In addition, 70 targets of 13 known miRNAs and 3 targets of a novel miRNA were identified by degradome analysis. The results of Northern blotting and quantitative real-time PCR showed that the expression levels of the selected miRNAs and their targets were mostly influenced by SCMV infection at 12 dpi, including up-regulation of miR168 and miR528, and down-regulation of miR159, miR397 and miR827. These results provide new insights into the regulatory networks of miRNAs and their targets in maize plants responsive to SCMV infection."
29455261,somatic embryogenesis,Phytoglobins regulate nitric oxide-dependent abscisic acid synthesis and ethylene-induced program cell death in developing maize somatic embryos,"During maize somatic embryogenesis, suppression of phytoglobins (Pgbs) reduced ABA levels leading to ethylene-induced programmed cell death in the developing embryos. These effects modulate embryonic yield depending on the cellular localization of specific phytoglobin gene expression. Suppression of Zea mays phytoglobins (ZmPgb1.1 or ZmPgb1.2) during somatic embryogenesis induces programmed cell death (PCD) by elevating nitric oxide (NO). While ZmPgb1.1 is expressed in many embryonic domains and its suppression results in embryo abortion, ZmPgb1.2 is expressed in the basal cells anchoring the embryos to the embryogenic tissue. Down-regulation of ZmPgb1.2 is required to induce PCD in these anchor cells allowing the embryos to develop further. Exogenous applications of ABA could reverse the effects caused by the suppression of either of the two ZmPgbs. A depletion of ABA, ascribed to a down-regulation of biosynthetic genes, was observed in those embryonic domains where the respective ZmPgbs were repressed. These effects were mediated by NO. Depletion in ABA content increased the transcription of genes participating in the synthesis and response of ethylene, as well as the accumulation of ethylene, which influenced embryogenesis. Somatic embryo number was reduced by high ethylene levels and increased with pharmacological treatments suppressing ethylene synthesis. The ethylene inhibition of embryogenesis was linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the execution of PCD. Integration of ABA and ethylene in the ZmPgb regulation of embryogenesis is proposed in a model where NO accumulates in ZmPgb-suppressing cells, decreasing the level of ABA. Abscisic acid inhibits ethylene biosynthesis and the NO-mediated depletion of ABA relieves this inhibition causing ethylene to accumulate. Elevated ethylene levels trigger production of ROS and induce PCD. Ethylene-induced PCD in the ZmPgb1.1-suppressing line [ZmPgb1.1 (A)] leads to embryo abortion, while PCD in the ZmPgb1.2-suppressing line [ZmPgb1.2 (A)] results in the elimination of the anchor cells and the successful development of the embryos."
29479358,response to Clavibacter michiganense,Analysis of extreme phenotype bulk copy number variation (XP-CNV) identified the association of rp1 with resistance to Goss's wilt of maize,"Goss's wilt (GW) of maize is caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn) and has spread in recent years throughout the Great Plains, posing a threat to production. The genetic basis of plant resistance is unknown. Here, a simple method for quantifying disease symptoms was developed and used to select cohorts of highly resistant and highly susceptible lines known as extreme phenotypes (XP). Copy number variation (CNV) analyses using whole genome sequences of bulked XP revealed 141 genes containing CNV between the two XP groups. The CNV genes include the previously identified common rust resistant locus rp1. Multiple Rp1 accessions with distinct rp1 haplotypes in an otherwise susceptible accession exhibited hypersensitive responses upon inoculation. GW provides an excellent system for the genetic dissection of diseases caused by closely related subspecies of C. michiganesis. Further work will facilitate breeding strategies to control GW and provide needed insight into the resistance mechanism of important related diseases such as bacterial canker of tomato and bacterial ring rot of potato."
29505629,response to corn earworm,Genome-wide association and metabolic pathway analysis of corn earworm resistance in maize,"Maize (Zea mays mays L.) is a staple crop of economic, industrial, and food security importance. Damage to the growing ears by corn earworm [Helicoverpa zea (Boddie)] is a major economic burden and increases secondary fungal infections and mycotoxin levels. To identify biochemical pathways associated with native resistance mechanisms, a genome-wide association analysis was performed, followed by pathway analysis using a gene-set enrichment-based approach. The gene-set enrichment exposed the cumulative effects of genes in pathways to identify those that contributed the most to resistance. Single nucleotide polymorphism��trait associations were linked to genes including transcription factors, protein kinases, hormone-responsive proteins, hydrolases, pectinases, xylogluconases, and the flavonol synthase gene (in the maysin biosynthesis pathway). The most significantly associated metabolic pathways identified included those that modified cell wall components, especially homogalacturonan, wax esters, and fatty acids; those involved in antibiosis, especially 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA), flavonoids, and phenolics; and those involved in plant growth, including N uptake and energy production. The pathways identified in this study, and especially the cell wall-associated pathways, identified here for the first time, provide clues to resistance mechanisms that could guide the identification of new resistant ideotypes and candidate genes for creation of resistant maize germplasm via selection of natural variants or gene editing."
29558449,response to salt,Long Non-Coding RNAs Responsive to Salt and Boron Stress in the Hyper-Arid Lluteño Maize from Atacama Desert.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, which lack significant protein coding potential and possess critical roles in diverse cellular processes. Long non-coding RNAs have recently been functionally characterized in plant stress-response mechanisms. In the present study, we perform a comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in response to combined stress induced by salinity and excess of boron in the Lluteño maize, a tolerant maize landrace from Atacama Desert, Chile. We use deep RNA sequencing to identify a set of 48,345 different lncRNAs, of which 28,012 (58.1%) are conserved with other maize (B73, Mo17 or Palomero), with the remaining 41.9% belonging to potentially Lluteño exclusive lncRNA transcripts. According to B73 maize reference genome sequence, most Lluteño lncRNAs correspond to intergenic transcripts. Interestingly, Lluteño lncRNAs presents an unusual overall higher expression compared to protein coding genes under exposure to stressed conditions. In total, we identified 1710 putatively responsive to the combined stressed conditions of salt and boron exposure. We also identified a set of 848 stress responsive potential trans natural antisense transcripts (trans-NAT) lncRNAs, which seems to be regulating genes associated with regulation of transcription, response to stress, response to abiotic stimulus and participating of the nicotianamine metabolic process. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were performed in a subset of lncRNAs, validating their existence and expression patterns. Our results suggest that a diverse set of maize lncRNAs from leaves and roots is responsive to combined salt and boron stress, being the first effort to identify lncRNAs from a maize landrace adapted to extreme conditions such as the Atacama Desert. The information generated is a starting point to understand the genomic adaptabilities suffered by this maize to surpass this extremely stressed environment."
29616394,response to parasitoid wasp; response to fall armyworm,Contrasting insect attraction and herbivore-induced plant volatile production in maize,"The maize inbred line W22 has lower herbivore-induced volatile production than B73 but both fall armyworm larvae and the wasps that parasitize them prefer W22 over B73. Maize inbred line W22 is an important resource for genetic studies due to the availability of the UniformMu mutant population and a complete genome sequence. In this study, we assessed the suitability of W22 as a model for tritrophic interactions between maize, Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and the parasitoid wasp Cotesia marginiventris. W22 was found to be a good model for studying the interaction as S. frugiperda prefers W22 over B73 and a higher parasitism rate by C. marginiventris was observed on W22 compared to the inbred line B73. W22 also produced lower amounts of many herbivore-induced volatile terpenes and indole emission upon treatment with S. frugiperda oral secretions. We propose that some of the major herbivore-induced terpene volatiles are perhaps impeding S. frugiperda and C. marginiventris preference and that as yet unidentified compounds are produced at low abundance may be positively impacting these interactions."
29720555,root development; response to aluminum,Auxin efflux carrier ZmPGP1 mediates root growth inhibition under aluminum stress,"Auxin has been shown to enhance root-growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, in maize (Zea mays), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the zmpgp1 mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the zmpgp1 mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, DR5rev:RFP, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip; which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of ZmPGP1. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process which is regulated by ZmPGP1, and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize."
29740466,nitrogen uptake; root morphology; nitrogen use efficiency,Root ideotype influences Nitrogen transport and assimilation in maize,"Maize (Zea mays, L.) yield is strongly influenced by external nitrogen inputs and their availability in the soil solution. Overuse of nitrogen-fertilizers can have detrimental ecological consequences through increased nitrogen pollution of water and the release of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide. To improve yield and overall nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), a deeper understanding of nitrogen uptake and utilization is required. This study examines the performance of two contrasting maize inbred lines, B73 and F44. F44 was selected in Florida on predominantly sandy acidic soils subject to nitrate leaching while B73 was selected in Iowa on rich mollisol soils. Transcriptional, enzymatic and nitrogen transport analytical tools were used to identify differences in their N absorption and utilization capabilities. Our results show that B73 and F44 differ significantly in their genetic, enzymatic, and biochemical root nitrogen transport and assimilatory pathways. The phenotypes show a strong genetic relationship linked to nitrogen form, where B73 showed a greater capacity for ammonium transport and assimilation whereas F44 preferred nitrate. The contrasting phenotypes are typified by differences in root system architecture (RSA) developed in the presence of both nitrate and ammonium. F44 crown roots were longer, had a higher surface area and volume with a greater lateral root number and density than B73. In contrast, B73 roots (primary, seminal, and crown) were more abundant but lacked the defining features of the F44 crown roots. An F1 hybrid between B73 and F44 mirrored the B73 nitrogen specificity and root architecture phenotypes, indicating complete dominance of the B73 inbred. This study highlights the important link between RSA and nitrogen management and why both variables need to be tested together when defining NUE improvements in any selection program."
29746459,Flowering,Parallel altitudinal clines reveal trends in adaptive evolution of genome size in Zea mays,"While the vast majority of genome size variation in plants is due to differences in repetitive sequence, we know little about how selection acts on repeat content in natural populations. Here we investigate parallel changes in intraspecific genome size and repeat content of domesticated maize (Zea mays) landraces and their wild relative teosinte across altitudinal gradients in Mesoamerica and South America. We combine genotyping, low coverage whole-genome sequence data, and flow cytometry to test for evidence of selection on genome size and individual repeat abundance. We find that population structure alone cannot explain the observed variation, implying that clinal patterns of genome size are maintained by natural selection. Our modeling additionally provides evidence of selection on individual heterochromatic knob repeats, likely due to their large individual contribution to genome size. To better understand the phenotypes driving selection on genome size, we conducted a growth chamber experiment using a population of highland teosinte exhibiting extensive variation in genome size. We find weak support for a positive correlation between genome size and cell size, but stronger support for a negative correlation between genome size and the rate of cell production. Reanalyzing published data of cell counts in maize shoot apical meristems, we then identify a negative correlation between cell production rate and flowering time. Together, our data suggest a model in which variation in genome size is driven by natural selection on flowering time across altitudinal clines, connecting intraspecific variation in repetitive sequence to important differences in adaptive phenotypes."
29754325,tasseling date; response to low phosphorus,Genome-wide association study dissects yield components associated with low-phosphorus stress tolerance in maize,"Phosphorus deficiency in soil is a worldwide constraint threatening maize production. Through a genome-wide association study, we identified molecular markers and associated candidate genes and molecular pathways for low-phosphorus stress tolerance. Phosphorus deficiency in soils will severely affect maize (Zea mays L.) growth and development, thus decreasing the final yield. Deciphering the genetic basis of yield-related traits can benefit our understanding of maize tolerance to low-phosphorus stress. However, considering that yield-related traits should be evaluated under field condition with large populations rather than under hydroponic condition at a single-plant level, searching for appropriate field experimental sites and target traits for low-phosphorus stress tolerance is still very challenging. In this study, a genome-wide association analysis using two natural populations was performed to detect candidate genes in response to low-phosphorus stress at two experimental sites representative of different climate and soil types. In total, 259 candidate genes were identified and these candidate genes are mainly involved in four major pathways: transcriptional regulation, reactive oxygen scavenging, hormone regulation, and remodeling of cell wall. Among these candidate genes, 98 showed differential expression by transcriptome data. Based on a haplotype analysis of grain number under phosphorus deficiency condition, the positive haplotypes with favorable alleles across five loci increased grain number by 42% than those without favorable alleles. For further verifying the feasibility of genomic selection for improving maize low-phosphorus tolerance, we also validated the predictive ability of five genomic selection methods and suggested that moderate-density SNPs were sufficient to make accurate predictions for low-phosphorus tolerance traits. All these results will facilitate elucidating genetic basis of maize tolerance to low-phosphorus stress and improving marker-assisted selection efficiency in breeding process."
29767790,mycorrhizal infection,Identification and functional characterization of a maize phosphate transporter induced by mycorrhiza formation,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant life, although it is frequently not readily available to crops. Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) can improve plant P levels by inducing the expression of some phosphate (Pi) transporters. Symbiotic Pi uptake by Pi transporters is crucial for AMF colonization and arbuscule dynamics. However, the functions of mycorrhiza-inducible maize Pi transporters are largely unclear. We focused on the interaction between the Pi concentration and AMF colonization in maize, and detecting the induction of Pi transporter. We investigated AMF colonization and arbuscular development in maize under high and low Pi environments. Low Pi increased AMF colonization and promoted arbuscular development. Further measurement of P concentration showed AMF significantly improved maize P status under low Pi condition. Here, we identified the Pi-transporter gene, ZmPt9, which was induced by mycorrhiza formation. In addition, ZmPt9-overexpressing roots were difficult to colonize by AMF. Pi-response analysis showed that ZmPt9 complements a yeast mutant defective in Pi transporter activity and improves the P concentration in rice. Together, these data indicated that ZmPt9 is a mycorrhiza-inducible Pi transporter involved in Pi uptake."
29869742,drought response,Roles of a maize phytochrome-interacting factors protein ZmPIF3 in regulation of drought stress responses by controlling stomatal closure in transgenic rice without yield penalty,"ZmPIF3 plays an important role in ABA-mediated regulation of stomatal closure in the control of water loss, and can improve both drought tolerance and did not affect the grain yield in the transgenic rice. Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are a subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and play important roles in regulating plant growth and development. In our previous study, overexpression of a maize PIFs family gene, ZmPIF3, improved drought tolerance in transgenic rice. In this study, measurement of water loss rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, guard cell aperture, density and length of ZmPIF3 transgenic plants showed that ZmPIF3 can enhance water-saving and drought-resistance by decreasing stomatal aperture and reducing transpiration in both transgenic rice and transgenic Arabidopsis. Scrutiny of sensitivity to ABA showed that ZmPIF3 transgenic rice was hypersensitive to ABA, while the endogenous ABA level was not significantly changed. These results indicate that ZmPIF3 plays a major role in the ABA signaling pathway. In addition, DGE results further suggest that ZmPIF3 participates in the ABA signaling pathway and regulates stomatal aperture in rice. Comparison analysis of the phenotype, physiology, and transcriptome of ZmPIF3 transgenic rice compared to control plants further suggests that ZmPIF3 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and enhances water-saving and drought-resistance traits by reducing stomatal openings to control water loss. Moreover, investigation of the agronomic traits of ZmPIF3 transgenic rice from four cultivating seasons showed that ZmPIF3 expression increased the tiller and panicle number and did not affect the grain yield in the transgenic rice. These results demonstrate that ZmPIF3 is a promising candidate gene in the transgenic breeding of water-saving and drought-resistant rice plants and crop improvement."
2988938,response to foxtail mosaic virus; response to barley stripe mosaic virus,"A low copy number, copia-like transposon in maize","Bs1, a transposable element that moved into the maize Adh1 gene following barley stripe mosaic virus infection, is shown to be present in 1-5 copies in all maize and teosinte lines tested. Bs1 sequences do not hybridize with the genome of barley stripe mosaic virus. The insertion of Bs1 is bounded by 304-bp perfect direct repeats, similar in structure to Ty1 in yeast, copia and related elements in Drosophila, and vertebrate pro-retroviruses, but different from all other known plant transposons. No free copies of the terminal sequences or large internal deletions of Bs elements could be detected. Bs1 is apparently not related to several transposons which moved into the Shrunken gene in lines made genetically unstable by barley stripe mosaic virus infection, suggesting that this virus may cause genome shock, resulting in a generalized liberation of transposons in response to environmental stress."
29926336,response to western corn rootworm,Plant bio-wars: Maize protein networks reveal tissue-specific defense strategies in response to a root herbivore,"In this study we examined global changes in protein expression in both roots and leaves of maize plants attacked by the root herbivore, Western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). The changes in protein expression Are indicative of metabolic changes during WCR feeding that enable the plant to defend itself. This is one of the first studies to look above- and below-ground at global protein expression patterns of maize plants grown in soil and infested with a root herbivore. We used advanced proteomic and network analyses to identify metabolic pathways that contribute to global defenses deployed by the insect resistant maize genotype, Mp708, infested with WCR. Using proteomic analysis, 4878 proteins in roots and leaves were detected and of these 863 showed significant changes of abundance during WCR infestation. Protein abundance patterns were analyzed using hierarchical clustering, protein correlation and protein-protein interaction networks. All three data analysis pipelines showed that proteins such as jasmonic acid biosynthetic enzymes, serine proteases, protease inhibitors, proteins involved in biosynthesis and signaling of ethylene, and enzymes producing reactive oxygen species and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, a precursor for volatile production, were upregulated in roots during WCR infestation. In leaves, highly abundant proteins were involved in signal perception suggesting activation of systemic signaling. We conclude that these protein networks contribute to the overall herbivore defense mechanisms in Mp708. Because the plants were grown in potting mix and not sterilized sand, we found that both microbial and insect defense-related proteins were present in the roots. The presence of the high constitutive levels of reduced ascorbate in roots and benzothiazole in the root volatile profiles suggest a tight tri-trophic interaction among the plant, soil microbiomes and WCR-infested roots suggesting that defenses against insects coexist with defenses against bacteria and fungi due to the interaction between roots and soil microbiota. In this study, which is one of the most complete descriptions of plant responses to root-feeding herbivore, we established an analysis pipeline for proteomics data that includes network biology that can be used with different types of ""omics"" data from a variety of organisms."
29948366,gravitropism,Graviperception in maize plants: is amyloplast sedimentation a red herring?,"Land plants perceive gravity and respond to it in an organ-specific way; shoots typically direct growth upwards, roots typically downwards. Historically, at least with respect to maize plants, this phenomenon is attributed to three sequential processes, namely graviperception, the transduction of the perceived signal, and the graviresponse, resulting in a typical (re)positioning of the organ or entire plant body relative to the gravivector. For decades, sedimentation of starch-containing plastids within the cells of special tissues has been regarded as the primary and initiating process fundamental for gravitropic growth (starch-statolith hypothesis). Based on Popper's falsification principle, uncompromising experiments were executed. The results indicate that the model of graviperception based on amyloplast sedimentation does not apply to maize seedlings."
29953466,response to Cercospora,Genome wide association study for gray leaf spot resistance in tropical maize core.,"Gray leaf spot is a maize foliar disease with worldwide distribution and can drastically reduce the production in susceptible genotypes. Published works indicate that resistance to gray leaf spot is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes, with additive effect and influenced by environment. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions, including putative genes, associated with resistance to gray leaf spot under natural conditions of disease occurrence. A genome wide association study was conducted with 355,972 single nucleotide polymorphism markers on a phenotypic data composed by 157 tropical maize inbred lines, evaluated at Maringá -Brazil. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with gray leaf spot, some of which were localized to previously reported quantitative trait loci regions. Three gene models linked to the associated single nucleotide polymorphism were expressed at flowering time and tissue related with gray leaf spot infection, explaining a considerable proportion of the phenotypic variance, ranging from 0.34 to 0.38. The gene model GRMZM2G073465 (bin 10.07) encodes a cysteine protease3 protein, gene model GRMZM2G007188 (bin 1.02) expresses a rybosylation factor-like protein and the gene model GRMZM2G476902 (bin 4.08) encodes an armadillo repeat protein. These three proteins are related with plant defense pathway. Once these genes are validated in next studies, they will be useful for marker-assisted selection and can help improve the understanding of maize resistance to gray leaf spot."
30010025,haploid production,Genome Editing and Double-Fluorescence Proteins Enable Robust Maternal Haploid Induction and Identification in Maize.,"We have developed an approach to create a haploid inducer with robust HID marker for a DH breeding system in maize and, possibly, for other important cereals as well. The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of ZmMTL (ZmPLA1) enabled a maternal haploid inducer to be created. The embryo- and endosperm-specific DFP marker was effective for maternal haploid identification for both mature seeds and young embryos. In addition, the system should be robust in an open pollination environment. It also offers the potential for other important cereals such as wheat, rice, and barley, for which there is no efficient HID selection method. With its broad application, this system has great potential for DH breeding and yield increase in major cereal crops."
30020530,root morphology,The quantitative genetic control of root architecture in maize,"Roots remain an under-explored frontier in plant genetics despite their well-known influence on plant development, agricultural performance, and competition in the wild. Visualizing and measuring root structures and their growth is vastly more difficult than characterizing aboveground parts of the plant and is often simply avoided. The majority of research on maize root systems has focused on their anatomy, physiology, development, and soil interactions but much less is known about the genetics that control quantitative traits. In maize, seven root development genes have been cloned using mutagenesis, but no genes underlying the many root-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified. In this review, we discuss whether the maize mutants known to control root development may also influence quantitative aspects of root architecture, including the extent to which they overlap with the most recent maize root-trait QTL. We highlight specific challenges and anticipate the impacts that emerging technologies, especially computational approaches, may have toward the identification of genes controlling root quantitative traits."
30025021,anthesis-silking interval,Association mapping of flowering and height traits in germplasm enhancement of maize doubled haploid (GEM-DH) lines,"Flowering and height related traits are extensively studied in maize for three main reasons: 1) easily obtained phenotypic measurements, 2) highly heritable, and 3) importance of these traits to adaptation and grain yield. However, variation in flowering and height traits is extensive and findings from previous studies are genotype specific. Herein, a diverse panel of exotic derived doubled haploid lines, in conjunction with genome-wide association analysis, is used to further explore adaptation related trait variation of exotic germplasm for potential use in adapting exotic germplasm to the U.S. Corn-Belt. Phenotypes for the association panel were obtained from six locations across the central-U.S. and genotyping was performed using the genotyping-by-sequencing method. Nineteen flowering time candidate genes were found for three flowering traits. Eighteen candidate genes were found for four height related traits, with the majority of the candidate genes relating to plant hormones auxin and gibberellin. A single gene was discovered for ear height that also had effects on -like flowering gene expression levels. Findings will be used to inform future research efforts of the USDA Germplasm Enhancement of Maize project and eventually aid in the rapid adaptation of exotic germplasm to temperate U.S. environments."
30025026,ear height; silking date; anthesis date,Four Parent Maize (FPM) population: Effects of mating designs on linkage disequilibrium and mapping quantitative traits,"Multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations can provide improved genetic mapping resolution by increasing allelic diversity and effective recombination. The Four Parent Maize (FPM; L.) population implemented five different mating designs used in MAGIC and bi-parental populations to compare empirical effects on genetic resolution and power of quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection; the combined population here comprised of 1149 individuals with 118,509 genetic markers. Measurements were recorded for plant height (PH), ear height (EH), days to anthesis (DTA) and silking (DTS) in seven environments, spanning three years. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of subpopulations indicated MAGIC population designs should incorporate generations of intermating to overcome initial LD increase caused by population admixture in a non-intermated four parent population (4way0sib). A 3- to 4-fold increase in genetic resolution (<0.8) and a 2.5-fold decrease in the extent of LD decay (<0.2) compared to the biparental populations was found for the four parent cross at the third generation of intermating (4way3sib). Power of QTL detection was affected to a greater extent by sample size rather than by mating designs. The FPM power simulations indicated that MAGIC populations have the ability to meet or exceed the mapping power of nested association panels with fewer individuals and diversity inputs. Using association mapping software we identified 2, 5, 7, and 6 QTL for PH, EH, DTA, and DTS, respectively. The FPM population is a valuable resource for quantifying empirical improvements of parent number, intermating, and the number of progeny for QTL linkage mapping."
30097269,response to salt,Maize similar to RCD1 gene induced by salt enhances Arabidopsis thaliana abiotic stress resistance,"Plant SRO (SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE) proteins play important roles in regulating oxidation and metal ion metabolism. Numbers of SRO proteins have been functional identified in Arabidopsis and rice, but little is known in maize. In this study, we identified a salt induced SRO gene, ZmSRO1b, from maize and analyzed its characteristics. ZmSRO1b expressed mainly in leaf tissues. The ZmSRO1b is encoded by 595 amino acid residues and shared conserved protein models with AtRCD1 and AtSRO1 from Arabidopsis. Promoter-elements analysis showed ZmSRO1b promoter harbored salt and metal stress responsive elements, DRE, GT-like and MRE. Further promoter inductive analysis by GUS staining and quantification confirmed that ZmSRO1b promoter was induced by salt and cadmium (Cd). Methylviologen (MV) simulated oxidative stress showed ZmSRO1b promoter was also induced by MV. Overexpression of ZmSRO1b in Arabidopsis plants showed increased resistance to salt, Cd and oxidative stress. Our results for the first time experimentally validate the function of ZmSRO1b and contribute to the better understanding of SRO genes across different plant species."
30191251,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,"Identification of a locus in maize controlling response to a host-selective toxin derived from Cochliobolus heterostrophus, causal agent of southern leaf blight","A host-selective, proteinaceous maize toxin was identified from the culture filtrate of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus. A dominant gene for toxin susceptibility was identified on maize chromosome 4. A toxic activity was identified from the culture filtrate (CF) of the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus, causal agent of the maize disease southern leaf blight (SLB) with differential toxicity on maize lines. Two independent mapping populations; a 113-line recombinant inbred line population and a 258-line association population, were used to map loci associated with sensitivity to the CF at the seedling stage. A major QTL on chromosome 4 was identified at the same locus using both populations. Mapping in the association population defined a 400 kb region that contained the sensitivity locus. By comparing CF-sensitivity of the parents of the RIL population with that of the F1 progeny, we determined that the sensitivity allele was dominant. No relationship was observed between CF-sensitivity in seedlings and SLB susceptibility in mature plants; however, a significant correlation (-&#8201;0.58) was observed between SLB susceptibility and CF-sensitivity in seedlings. The activity of the CF was light-dependent and was sensitive to pronase, indicating that the toxin was proteinaceous."
30208841,cytoplasmic male sterility,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals that tricarboxylic acid cycle-related genes are associated with maize CMS-C fertility restoration,"BACKGROUND: C-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-C) is one of the three major types of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in maize. Rf4 is a dominant restorer gene for CMS-C and has great value in hybrid maize breeding, but little information concerning its functional mechanism is known.<p> RESULTS: To reveal the functional mechanism of Rf4, we developed a pair of maize near-isogenic lines (NILs) for the Rf4 locus, which included a NIL_rf4 male-sterile line and a NIL_Rf4 male fertility-restored line. Genetic analysis and molecular marker detection indicated that the male fertility of NIL_Rf4 was controlled by Rf4. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated genomic differences between the two NILs was clustered in the Rf4 mapping region. Unmapped reads of NILs were further assembled to uncover Rf4 candidates. RNA-Seq was then performed for the developing anthers of the NILs to identify critical genes and pathways associated with fertility restoration. A total of 7125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These DEGs were significantly enriched in 242 Gene Ontology (GO) categories, wherein 100 DEGs were involved in pollen tube development, pollen tube growth, pollen development, and gametophyte development. Homology analysis revealed 198 male fertility-related DEGs, and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 58 DEGs were enriched in cell energy metabolism processes involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and pyruvate metabolism. By querying the Plant Reactome Pathway database, we found that 14 of the DEGs were involved in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and that most of them belonged to the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) enzyme complexes. Transcriptome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that all the above TCA cycle-related genes were up-regulated in NIL_Rf4. The results of our subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments pointed out that the contents of both the IDH and OGDH enzymes accumulated more in the spikelets of NIL_Rf4 than in those of NIL_rf4.<p> CONCLUSION: The present research provides valuable genomic resources for deep insight into the molecular mechanism underlying CMS-C male fertility restoration. Importantly, our results indicated that genes involved in energy metabolism, especially some mitochondrial TCA cycle-related genes, were associated with maize CMS-C male fertility restoration."
30213868,kernel row number,Empirical comparisons of different statistical models to identify and validate kernel row number-associated variants from structured multi-parent mapping populations of maize,"Advances in next generation sequencing technologies and statistical approaches enable genome-wide dissection of phenotypic traits via genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although multiple statistical approaches for conducting GWAS are available, the power and cross-validation rates of many approaches have been mostly tested using simulated data. Empirical comparisons of single variant (SV) and multi-variant (MV) GWAS approaches have not been conducted to test if a single approach or a combination of SV and MV is effective, through identification and cross-validation of trait associated loci. In this study, kernel row number (KRN) data were collected from a set of 6,230 entries derived from the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population and related populations. Three different types of GWAS analyses were performed: 1) single-variant (SV), 2) stepwise regression (STR) and 3) a Bayesian-based multi-variant (MV) model. Using SV, STR, and BMV models, 257, 300, and 442 KRN-associated variants (KAVs) were identified in the initial GWAS analyses. Of these, 231 KAVs were subjected to genetic validation using three unrelated populations that were not included in the initial GWAS. Genetic validation results suggest that the three GWAS approaches are complementary. Interestingly, KAVs in low recombination regions were more likely to exhibit associations in independent populations than KAVs in recombinationally active regions, probably as a consequence of linkage disequilibrium. The KAVs identified in this study have the potential to enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of ear development."
30220503,days to flowering; inflorescence development,Stepwise cis-regulatory changes in ZCN8 contribute to maize flowering-time adaptation,"Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) was domesticated in southwestern Mexico &#8764;9,000 years ago from its wild ancestor, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) [1]. From its center of origin, maize experienced a rapid range expansion and spread over 90�� of latitude in the Americas [2-4], which required a novel flowering-time adaptation. ZEA CENTRORADIALIS 8 (ZCN8) is the maize florigen gene and has a central role in mediating flowering [5, 6]. Here, we show that ZCN8 underlies a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) (qDTA8) for flowering time that was consistently detected in multiple maize-teosinte experimental populations. Through association analysis in a large diverse panel of maize inbred lines, we identified a SNP (SNP-1245) in the ZCN8 promoter that showed the strongest association with flowering time. SNP-1245 co-segregated with qDTA8 in maize-teosinte mapping populations. We demonstrate that SNP-1245 is associated with differential binding by the flowering activator ZmMADS1. SNP-1245 was a target of selection during early domestication, which drove the pre-existing early flowering allele to near fixation in maize. Interestingly, we detected an independent association block upstream of SNP-1245, wherein the early flowering allele that most likely originated from Zea mays ssp. mexicana introgressed into the early flowering haplotype of SNP-1245 and contributed to maize adaptation to northern high latitudes. Our study demonstrates how independent cis-regulatory variants at a gene can be selected at different evolutionary times for local adaptation, highlighting how complex cis-regulatory control mechanisms evolve. Finally, we propose a polygenic map for the pre-Columbian spread of maize throughout the Americas."
30245698,nuclear male sterility,Generation of Transgene-Free Maize Male Sterile Lines Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System.,"Male sterility (MS) provides a useful breeding tool to harness hybrid vigor for hybrid seed production. It is necessary to generate new male sterile mutant lines for the development of hybrid seed production technology. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is well suited for targeting genomes to generate male sterile mutants. In this study, we artificially synthesized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene with biased codons of maize. A CRISPR/Cas9 vector targeting the MS8 gene of maize was constructed and transformed into maize using an Agrobacterium-mediated method, and eight T0 independent transgenic lines were generated. Sequencing results showed that MS8 genes in these T0 transgenic lines were not mutated. However, we detected mutations in the MS8 gene in F1 and F2 progenies of the transgenic line H17. A potential off-target site sequence which had a single nucleotide that was different from the target was also mutated in the F2 progeny of the transgenic line H17. Mutation in the MS8 gene and the male sterile phenotype could be stably inherited by the next generation in a Mendelian fashion. Transgene-free ms8 male sterile plants were obtained by screening the F2 generation of male sterile plants, and the MS phenotype could be introduced into other elite inbred lines for hybrid production."
30289553,response to Gibberella root rot,Ethylene signaling regulates natural variation in the abundance of antifungal acetylated diferuloylsucroses and Fusarium graminearum resistance in maize seedling roots,"The production and regulation of defensive specialized metabolites play a central role in pathogen resistance in maize (Zea mays) and other plants. Therefore, identification of genes involved in plant specialized metabolism can contribute to improved disease resistance.<p> We used comparative metabolomics to identify previously unknown antifungal metabolites in maize seedling roots, and investigated the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying their natural variation using quantitative trait locus mapping and comparative transcriptomics approaches.<p> Two maize metabolites, smilaside A (3,6&#8208;diferuloyl&#8208;3&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;diacetylsucrose) and smiglaside C (3,6&#8208;diferuloyl&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;triacetylsucrose), were identified that could contribute to maize resistance against Fusarium graminearum and other fungal pathogens. Elevated expression of an ethylene signaling gene, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (ZmEIN2), co&#8208;segregated with a decreased smilaside A : smiglaside C ratio. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of ethylene availability and sensitivity in vivo indicated that, whereas ethylene was required for the production of both metabolites, the smilaside A : smiglaside C ratio was negatively regulated by ethylene sensitivity. This ratio, rather than the absolute abundance of these two metabolites, was important for maize seedling root defense against F. graminearum.<p> Ethylene signaling regulates the relative abundance of the two F. graminearum&#8208;resistance&#8208;related metabolites and affects resistance against F. graminearum in maize seedling roots. "
30295904,root morphology; phosphorus uptake,Greater lateral root branching density in maize improves phosphorus acquisition from low phosphorus soil,"The development of crops with better growth under suboptimal phosphorus availability would improve food security in developing countries while reducing environmental pollution in developed countries. We tested the hypothesis that maize (Zea mays) phenotypes with greater lateral root branching density have greater phosphorus acquisition from low phosphorus soils. Recombinant inbred lines with either 'many short' (MS) or 'few long' (FL) lateral root phenotypes were grown under high and low phosphorus conditions in greenhouse mesocosms and in the field. Under low phosphorus in mesocosms, lines with the MS phenotype had 89% greater phosphorus acquisition and 48% more shoot biomass than FL lines. Under low phosphorus in the field, MS lines had 16% shallower rooting depth (D95), 81% greater root length density in the top 20 cm of the soil, 49% greater shoot phosphorus content, 12% greater leaf photosynthesis, 19% greater shoot biomass, and 14% greater grain yield than FL lines. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the phenotype of many, shorter lateral roots improves phosphorus acquisition under low phosphorus availability and merits consideration for genetic improvement of phosphorus efficiency in maize and other crops."
30327994,plant height,Global transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network analyses reveal hybrid-specific modules and candidate genes related to plant height development in maize,"Plant height, an important trait for maize breeding because of its close relatedness to lodging resistance and yield, has been reported to be determined by multiple qualitative and quantitative genes. However, few genes related to plant height have been characterized in maize. Herein, three different maize hybrids, with extremely distinct plant height, which were further classified into low (L), middle (M) and high (H) group, were selected for RNA sequencing at three key developmental stages, namely, jointing stage (I), big flare period (II) and tasseling stage (III). Intriguingly, transcriptome profiles for hybrids ranging from low to high group exhibited significantly similarity in both jointing stage and big flare period. However, remarkably larger differentially expressed genes could be detected between hybrid from low to either middle or high group in tasseling stage. These results were repeatedly observed in both phenotyping and gene ontology enrichment analysis, indicating that transition from big flare period to tasseling stage plays a critical role in determination of plant height. Furthermore, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was explored to find key hub genes involved in plant height regulation. Hundreds of candidate genes, encoding various transcription factors, and regulators involved in internode cell regulation and cell wall synthesis were identified in our network. More importantly, great majority of candidates were correlated to either metabolism or signaling pathway of several plant phytohormones. Particularly, numerous functionally characterized genes in gibberellic acid as well as brassinosteroids signaling transduction pathways were also discovered, suggesting their critical roles in plant height regulation. The present study could provide a modestly comprehensive insight into networks for regulation of plant height in maize."
30351458,water use efficiency,Leaf stable carbon isotope composition reflects transpiration efficiency in Zea mays,"The increasing demand for food production and predicted climate change scenarios highlight the need for improvements in crop sustainability. The efficient use of water will become increasingly important for rain&#8208;fed agricultural crops even in fertile regions that have historically received ample precipitation. Improvements in water&#8208;use efficiency in Zea mays have been limited, and warrant a renewed effort aided by molecular breeding approaches. Progress has been constrained by the difficulty of measuring water&#8208;use in a field environment. The stable carbon isotope composition (&#948;13C) of the leaf has been proposed as an integrated signature of carbon fixation with a link to stomatal conductance. However, additional factors affecting leaf &#948;13C exist, and a limited number of studies have explored this trait in Z. mays. Here we present an extensive characterization of leaf &#948;13C in Z. mays. Significant variation in leaf &#948;13C exists across diverse lines of Z. mays, which we show to be heritable across several environments. Furthermore, we examine temporal and spatial variation in leaf &#948;13C to determine the optimum sampling time to maximize the use of leaf &#948;13C as a trait. Finally, our results demonstrate the relationship between transpiration and leaf &#948;13C in the field and the greenhouse. Decreasing transpiration and soil moisture are associated with decreasing leaf &#948;13C. Taken together these results outline a strategy for using leaf &#948;13C and reveal its usefulness as a measure of transpiration efficiency under well&#8208;watered conditions rather than a predictor of performance under drought."
30444162,response to Ustilago maydis,Application of the pathogen Trojan horse approach in maize (Zea mays),"Maize, Zea mays, the second-most-widely-grown crop, yields 20 % of all consumed calories worldwide.1 Despite its agronomic importance, research progress is limited by costly transformation. We recently described the Trojan horse method as a useful tool to study maize proteins in situ that circumvents time- and space-consuming whole plant transformation. The Trojan horse approach uses the protein-folding and secretory properties of the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis to secrete maize proteins from fungal cells into the maize apoplast. Here, we discuss the timing and location of U. maydis during infection and the protein secretion site in relation to anther anatomy. This spatiotemporal analysis enables the study of apoplastic anther proteins in various premeiotic anther developmental stages, and could be adapted for larger screens."
30497385,haploid production,In vivo haploid induction leads to increased frequency of twin-embryo and abnormal fertilization in maize,"BACKGROUND: In vivo haploid induction (HI) based on Stock6-derived inducer lines has been the most prevalent means of producing haploids. Nevertheless, the biological mechanism of HI is not fully understood, the twin-embryo kernels had been found during haploid induction, which may provide potential evidence for the abnormal double fertilization during HI.<p> RESULTS: We investigated twin-embryo frequency in progenies of different haploid inducers. Results reveal that increasing the HI potential significantly improved the frequency of twin-embryo kernels. Compared with the average twin-embryo kernel frequency (average frequency&#8201;=&#8201;0.07%) among progenies pollinated by the haploid inducer line CAUHOI, the frequency of twin-embryo was improved to 0.16% in progenies pollinated by the haploid inducer line CAU5. This result was further confirmed by pollinating single hybrid ND5598 with four haploid inducers possessing differentiated HIRs, where twin-embryo frequency was highly correlated with HIR. Among 237 twin-embryo kernels, we identified 30 haploid twin-embryo kernels (12.66%), a frequency which was much greater than the average HI rate for three other inducer lines (frequency range 2-10%). In addition, aneuploids, occurred at high frequency (8 in 41 twin plants). This level of aneuploidy provides new insight into the abnormal double fertilization during HI. Moreover, we observed differences in growth rate between twin plants in the field, as 4.22% of the twin plants grew at a significantly different rate. Both simple sequence repeats markers (SSR) and 3072 SNP-chip genotyping results revealed that >&#8201;90% of the twin plants shared the same origin, and the growth difference could be attributed to aneuploidy, competition for nutrients, and possible hormone regulation.<p> CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that an enhanced HI ability can increase twin-embryo kernel frequency, and high frequency of both haploid twin-embryo kernels and aneuploidy observed in this research give us new insights to understand the mechanism of both HI and abnormal embryogenesis."
30548709,kernel size; kernel development,Kernel size-related genes revealed by an integrated eQTL analysis during early maize kernel development,"In maize, kernel traits strongly impact overall grain yields, and it is known that sophisticated spatiotemporal programs of gene expression coordinate kernel development, so advancing our knowledge of kernel development can help efforts to improve grain yields. Here, using phenotype, genotype, and transcriptomics data of maize kernels at 5 and 15 days after pollination (DAP) for a large association mapping panel, we employed multiple quantitative genetics approaches��genome wide association studies (GWAS) as well as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analyses��to gain insights about molecular genetic basis of kernel development in maize. This resulted in the identification of 137 putative kernel length&#8208;related genes at 5 DAP, of which 43 are located in previously reported QTL regions. Strikingly, we identified an eQTL that overlaps the locus encoding a maize homolog of the recently described m6A methylation reader protein ECT2 from Arabidopsis; this putative epieQTL is associated with 53 genes and may represent a master epi&#8208;transcriptomic regulator of kernel development. Notably, among the genes associated with this epieQTL, 10 are for the main storage proteins in the maize endosperm (zeins) and two are known regulators of zein expression or endosperm development (Opaque2 and ZmICE1). Collectively, beyond cataloging and characterizing genomic attributes of a large number of expression quantitative trait loci associated with kernel development in maize, our study highlights how an eQTL approach can bolster the impact of both GWAS and QTT studies and can drive insights about the basic biology of plants."
30607602,kernel development,The miR164-dependent regulatory pathway in developing maize seed,"MicroRNA164 (miR164) plays a key role in leaf and flower development, lateral root initiation, and stress responses. However, little is known about the regulatory roles of miR164 during seed development, particularly in maize. The aim of this study was to discover the developmental function of miR164 in maize seed. Small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) was performed at two key stages. The results indicated that miR164 was down-regulated during maize seed development. In addition, degradome library sequencing and transient expression assays identified the target genes for miR164. Two microRNA (miRNA) pairs, miR164-NAM, ATAF, and CUC32 (NAC32) and miR164-NAC40, were isolated. The developmental function of miR164 was determined by analyzing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the wild-type and miR164 transgenic lines using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and by screening the DEGs related to NAC32 and NAC40 via co-expression and transient expression analysis. These results identified two beta-expansin genes, EXPB14 and EXPB15, which were located downstream of the NAC32 and NAC40 genes. This study revealed, for the first time, a miR164-dependent regulatory pathway, miR164-NAC32/NAC40-EXPB14/EXPB15, which participates in maize seed expansion. These findings highlight the significance of miR164 in maize seed development, and can be used to explore the role of miRNA in seed development."
30626322,osmotic stress response; response to salt,A cytosolic NAD+-dependent GPDH from maize (ZmGPDH1) is involved in conferring salt and osmotic stress tolerance,"Background: Plant glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzes the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to produce glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), and plays a key role in glycerolipid metabolism as well as stress responses.<p> Results: In this study, we report the cloning, enzymatic and physiological characterization of a cytosolic NAD+-dependent GPDH from maize. The prokaryotic expression of ZmGPDH1 in E.coli showed that the enzyme encoded by ZmGPDH1 was capable of catalyzing the reduction of DHAP in the presence of NADH. The functional complementation analysis revealed that ZmGPDH1 was able to restore the production of glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerol in AtGPDHc-deficient mutants. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmGPDH1 remarkably enhanced the tolerance of Arabidopsis to salinity/osmotic stress by enhancing the glycerol production, the antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, CAT, APX) and by maintaining the cellular redox homeostasis (NADH/NAD+, ASA/DHA, GSH/GSSG). ZmGPDH1 OE Arabidopsis plants also exhibited reduced leaf water loss and stomatal aperture under salt and osmotic stresses. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that overexpression of ZmGPDH1 promoted the transcripts accumulation of genes involved in cellular redox homeostasis and ROS-scavenging system.<p> Conclusions: Together, these data suggested that ZmGPDH1 is involved in conferring salinity and osmotic tolerance in Arabidopsis through modulation of glycerol synthesis, stomatal closure, cellular redox and ROS homeostasis."
30651637,response to Ustilago maydis,A kiwellin disarms the metabolic activity of a secreted fungal virulence factor,"Fungi-induced plant diseases affect global food security and plant ecology. The biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease in maize (Zea mays) plants by secreting numerous virulence effectors that reprogram plant metabolism and immune responses1,2. The secreted fungal chorismate mutase Cmu1 presumably affects biosynthesis of the plant immune signal salicylic acid by channelling chorismate into the phenylpropanoid pathway3. Here we show that one of the 20 maize-encoded kiwellins (ZmKWL1) specifically blocks the catalytic activity of Cmu1. ZmKWL1 hinders substrate access to the active site of Cmu1 through intimate interactions involving structural features that are specific to fungal Cmu1 orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that plant kiwellins have a versatile scaffold that can specifically counteract pathogen effectors such as Cmu1. We reveal the biological activity of a member of the kiwellin family, a widely conserved group of proteins that have previously been recognized only as important human allergens."
30704393,stalk quality,Genome-wide association analysis of stalk biomass and anatomical traits in maize,"Background: Maize stover is an important source of crop residues and a promising sustainable energy source in the United States. Stalk is the main component of stover, representing about half of stover dry weight. Characterization of genetic determinants of stalk traits provide a foundation to optimize maize stover as a biofuel feedstock. We investigated maize natural genetic variation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to detect candidate genes associated with traits related to stalk biomass (stalk diameter and plant height) and stalk anatomy (rind thickness, vascular bundle density and area).<p> Results: Using a panel of 942 diverse inbred lines, 899,784 RNA-Seq derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified. Stalk traits were measured on 800 members of the panel in replicated field trials across years. GWAS revealed 16 candidate genes associated with four stalk traits. Most of the detected candidate genes were involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. Two of the regulatory genes (Zmm22 and an ortholog of Fpa) that were associated with plant height were previously shown to be involved in regulating the vegetative to floral transition. The association of Zmm22 with plant height was confirmed using a transgenic approach. Transgenic lines with increased expression of Zmm22 showed a significant decrease in plant height as well as tassel branch number, indicating a pleiotropic effect of Zmm22.<P> Conclusion: Substantial heritable variation was observed in the association panel for stalk traits, indicating a large potential for improving useful stalk traits in breeding programs. Genome-wide association analyses detected several candidate genes associated with multiple traits, suggesting common regulatory elements underlie various stalk traits. Results of this study provide insights into the genetic control of maize stalk anatomy and biomass."
30754872,agrobacterium mediated transformation,The use of phosphomannose-isomerase as a selectable marker to recover transgenic maize plants (Zea mays L.) via Agrobacterium transformation,A new selectable marker system has been adapted for use in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize. This selection system utilizes the pmi gene encoding for phosphomannose-isomerase that converts mannose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. Only transformed cells are capable of utilizing mannose as a carbon source. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of immature embryos followed by a pre-selection of 10-14 days prior to selection at a level of 1% mannose and 0.5% sucrose led to the recovery of trangenic lines of a frequency of as high as 30% in about 12 weeks. Molecular and genetic analysis showed that selected plants contained the pmi gene and that the gene was transmitted to the progeny in a Mendelian fashion.
30792433,aleurone color,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals differentially expressed genes related to the tissue-specific accumulation of anthocyanins in pericarp and aleurone layer for maize.,"Purple corn is a rich source of anthocyanins. In the experiment, two anthocyanins-enriched purple corn lines Ha0414 and Ha6130 were identified. The anthocyanins were respectively accumulated in the pericarp of Ha0414 and the aleurone layer of Ha6130 with different composition and content. Transcriptome analysis of the two tissues in both lines identified 16 and 14 differentially expressed genes belonging to anthocyanin metabolism pathway in pericarp and the aleurone layer, individually. Of these genes, two genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe (II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily proteins, and one gene annotated as UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily protein exhibited increased transcript abundance in both the colored pericarp and aleurone layer. Otherwise, one gene annotated as flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase, and another gene encoding flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase displayed increased transcript abundance in the aleurone layer of Ha6130. Moreover, 36 transcription factors were identified with increased transcript abundance in the pericarp of Ha0414, such as bHLH transcription factors, WRKY transcription factors, and HB transcription factors. And 79 transcription factors were isolated with an increased expression level in the aleurone layer of Ha6130, including MYB transcription factors, MYB-related transcription factors, and bHLH transcription factors. These genes expression may result in the tissue-specific accumulation of anthocyanins in pericarp and aleurone layer."
30798487,response to maize weevil,Overexpression of the ZmDEF1 gene increases the resistance to weevil larvae in transgenic maize seeds,"Plant defensins are divided into 18 groups and are multifunctional proteins. The Zea mays defensin 1 (ZmDEF1) gene encodes the defensin 1 protein, which can inhibit alpha-amylase in the insect gut. In this study, the ZmDEF1 gene was transferred into two maize cultivars, LC1 and LVN99, to improve weevil resistance in maize. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein was assessed for its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase in the gut of the larvae of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motsch.). ZmDEF1 was cloned into a pBetaPhaso-dest vector, which harbours phaseolin, a seed-specific promoter, and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 harbouring the pBetaPhaso-ZmDEF1 vector was used to transfer the ZmDEF1 gene into two maize cultivars using immature embryos. Transformed calluses were selected on selection media containing kanamycin. The stable integration of the ZmDEF1 transgene into the transgenic maize plant genome was confirmed using Southern blotting. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein of approximately 10 kDa was expressed in three transgenic maize lines from the LC1 cultivar (C1, C3, and C5) and two transgenic maize lines from the LVN99 cultivar (L1 and L3). The ZmDEF1 transgenic efficiency based on the results of PCR, as well as Southern and Western blotting, was 1.32% and 0.82%, respectively, which depends on the genotypes of LC1 and LVN99. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein inhibited the alpha-amylase activity of the maize weevil larvae, and its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase is 54.52-63.09% greater than the ZmDEF1 protein extracted from non-transgenic plants."
30803125,salinity tolerance,Genome-wide association study dissects the genetic bases of salt tolerance in maize seedlings,"Excess salinity is a natural stress that causes crop yield losses worldwide. The genetic bases of maize salt tolerance remain largely unknown. Here we investigated the survival rates of 445 maize natural accessions after salt treatments. A skewed distribution of the salt-tolerant phenotypes was observed in this population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed 57 loci significantly associated with salt tolerance. Forty-nine candidate genes were detected from these loci. About 10% of these genes were co-localized with loci from QTL mapping. Forty four percent of the candidate genes were involved in stress responses, ABA signaling, stomata division, DNA binding/transcription regulation and auxin signaling, suggesting that they are key genetic mechanisms of maize salt tolerance. Transgenic studies showed that two genes, the salt-tolerance-associated-gene 4 (SAG4, GRMZM2G077295) and SAG6 (GRMZM2G106056), which encode a protein transport protein and the double-strand break repair protein MRE11 respectively, had positive roles in plant salt tolerance, and their salt-tolerant haplotypes were revealed. The genes we identified in this study provide a list of candidate targets for further study of maize salt tolerance, and of genetic markers and materials that may be used for breeding salt-tolerance in maize."
30895446,apomixis,"Allopolyploidization facilitates gene flow and speciation among corn, Zea perennis and Tripsacum dactyloides","Eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) and tetraploid perennial teosinte (Zea perennis) are well known to possess genes conferring resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses as well as adaptation to flood and aluminum toxic soils. However, plant breeders have been hampered to utilize these and other beneficial traits for maize improvement due to sterility in their hybrids. By crossing a tetraploid maize-inbred line x T. dactyloides, a female fertile hybrid was produced that was crossed with Z. perennis to yield a tri-genomic female fertile hybrid, which was backcrossed with diploid maize to produce BC1 and BC2. The tri-genomic hybrid provided a new way to transfer genetic material from both species into maize by utilizing conventional plant breeding methods. On the basis of cytogenetic observations using multi-color genomic in situ hybridization, the progenies were classified into four groups, in which chromosomes could be scaled both up and down with ease to produce material for varying breeding and genetic purposes via apomixis or sexual reproduction. In the present study, pathways were found to recover maize and to obtain specific translocations as well as a speedy recovery of the T. dactyloides-maize addition line in a second backcross generation. However, phenotypes of the recovered maize were in most cases far from maize as a result of genetic load from T. dactyloides and Z. perennis, and could not be directly used as a maize-inbred line but could serve as an intermediate material for maize improvement. A series of hybrids was produced (having varying chromosome number, constitution, and translocations) with agronomic traits from all three parental species. The present study provides an application of overcoming the initial interspecific barriers among these species. Moreover, T. dactyloides is closely related to Z. mays L. ssp. mays since Z. perennis and the MTP tri- species hybrid have four possible reproductive modes."
30955674,phenolic content,"Relationship of phenolic composition of selected purple maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes with their anti-inflammatory, anti-adipogenic and anti-diabetic potential","This study aimed to investigate the associations between phenolic composition of selected purple maize genotypes and their anti-inflammatory, anti-adipogenic and anti-diabetic properties in vitro. Anthocyanin-rich water extracts (PMWs) from 20 purple maize genotypes were evaluated in RAW 264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under different conditions. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (Pr3G), peonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G) and corresponding acylated forms were major anthocyanins in PMW, accompanied by ten tentatively identified non-anthocyanin phenolics. Correlation studies showed that C3G, P3G, and derivatives, but not Pr3G and its acylated form contributed to the biological properties of PMW. Besides anthocyanins, quercetin, luteolin, and rutin were the dominant anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic components, in terms of down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediator production in inflamed macrophages and adipocytes, modulating diabetes-related key enzymes and improving insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adipocytes. Quercetin and phenolic acids, especially vanillic acid and protocatechuic acid, were closely associated with anti-adipogenic properties of PMW via inhibition of the preadipocyte-adipocyte transition."
30990862,response to corn earworm,Development and application of a quantitative bioassay to evaluate maize silk resistance to corn earworm herbivory among progenies derived from Peruvian landrace Piura,"Corn earworm (CEW), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a major insect pest of corn (Zea mays spp. mays L.). CEW larvae feed on silks, kernels and cobs, causing substantial yield and quality losses both through herbivory and by vectoring pathogens. The long-term goal of this work is to elucidate the genetic and biochemical basis of a potentially novel CEW resistance source discovered in silk tissue of Piura 208, a Peruvian landrace of maize (PI 503849). We developed a quantitative CEW bioassay and tested it on four populations that contrast alleles from Piura 208 with those from GT119, a CEW-susceptible maize inbred line. In replicated analyses of two populations of F1:2 families, corn genotype accounts for 84% and 68% of the variance in CEW larval weights, and up to 60% of the variance in CEW pupation percentage, demonstrating both the success of the quantitative bioassay and the strength of the Piura 208 resistance mechanism. Analyses of two corresponding populations of BC1:2 families revealed substantially diminished effects of corn genotype on CEW weight gain and pupation. This loss of Piura 208-derived CEW resistance during backcrossing suggests complex (multi-genic) inheritance of a threshold-dependent mechanism. Technical factors in bioassay performance were also assessed, often by analyzing the 1,641 CEW larvae that were raised on control diet (meridic with no corn silks added). Minor, but statistically significant impacts on CEW weight gain, pupation, and mortality were attributable to multiple technical factors in the preparation, incubation and evaluation phases of the bioassay, demonstrating the importance of randomization, stratification, replication, and variable-tracking across the many steps of this quantitative CEW bioassay. Overall, these findings indicate that this scaled-up, quantitative CEW bioassay is fundamentally sound and that Piura 208-derived resistance alleles are experimentally tractable for genetic and mechanistic research using this approach."
30997296,drought response,Genome-wide analysis of maize OSCA family members and their involvement in drought stress.,"Background: Worldwide cultivation of maize is often impacted negatively by drought stress. Hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels (OSCA) have been characterized as osmosensors in Arabidopsis. However, the involvement of members of the maize OSCA (ZmOSCA) gene family in response to drought stress is unknown. It is furthermore unclear which ZmOSCA gene plays a major role in genetic improvement of drought tolerance in Maize. 

Methods: We predicted the protein domain structure and transmembrane regions by using the NCBI Conserved Domain Database database and TMHMM server separately. The phylogeny tree was built by Mega7. We used the mixed linear model in TASSEL to perform the family-based association analysis. 

Results: In this report, 12 ZmOSCA genes were uncovered in the maize genome by a genome-wide survey and analyzed systematically to reveal their synteny and phylogenetic relationship with the genomes of rice, maize, and sorghum. These analyses indicated a relatively conserved evolutionary history of the ZmOSCA gene family. Protein domain and transmembrane analysis indicated that most of the 12 ZmOSCAs shared similar structures with their homologs. The result of differential expression analysis under drought at various stages, as well as the expression profiles in 15 tissues, revealed a functional divergence of ZmOSCA genes. Notably, the expression level of ZmOSCA4.1 being up-regulated in both seedlings and adult leaves. Notably, the association analysis between genetic variations in these genes and drought tolerance was detected. Significant associations between genetic variation in ZmOSCA4.1 and drought tolerance were found at the seedling stage. Our report provides a detailed analysis of the ZmOSCAs in the maize genome. These findings will contribute to future studies on the functional characterization of ZmOSCA proteins in response to water deficit stress, as well as understanding the mechanism of genetic variation in drought tolerance in maize."
31370805,drought response,Effects of maize organ-specific drought stress response on yields from transcriptome analysis.,"Background: Drought is a serious causal factor of reduced crop yields than any other abiotic stresses. As one of the most widely distributed crops, maize plants frequently suffer from drought stress, which causes great losses in the final kernel yield. Drought stress response in plants showed tissue- and developmental stage-specific characteristics. 

Results: In this study, the ears at the V9 stage, kernels and ear leaf at the 5DAP (days after pollination) stage of maize were used for morphological, physiological and comparative transcriptomics analysis to understand the different features of ""sink"" or ""source"" organs and the effects on kernel yield under drought stress conditions. The ABA-, NAC-mediate signaling pathway, osmotic protective substance synthesis and protein folding response were identified as common drought stress response in the three organs. Tissue-specific drought stress responses and the regulators were identified, they were highly correlated with growth, physiological adaptation and yield loss under drought stress. For ears, drought stress inhibited ear elongation, led to the abnormal differentiation of the paired spikelet, and auxin signaling involved in the regulation of cell division and growth and primordium development changes. In the kernels, reduced kernel size caused by drought stress was observed, and the obvious differences of auxin, BR and cytokine signaling transduction appeared, which indicated the modification in carbohydrate metabolism, cell differentiation and growth retardation. For the ear leaf, dramatically and synergistically reduced the expression of photosynthesis genes were observed when suffered from drought stress, the ABA- and NAC- mediate signaling pathway played important roles in the regulation of photosynthesis. 

Conclusions: Transcriptomic changes caused by drought were highly correlated with developmental and physiological adaptation, which was closely related to the final yield of maize, and a sketch of tissue- and developmental stage-specific responses to drought stress in maize was drafted."
31861651,response to maize chlorotic mottle virus,Proteomic changes during MCMV infection revealed by iTRAQ quantitative proteomic analysis in maize,"Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) has been occurring frequently worldwide and causes
severe yield losses in maize (Zea mays). To better investigate the destructive eects of MCMV infection
on maize plants, isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based comparative
proteomic analysis was performed on MCMV infected maize cv. B73. A total of 972 dierentially
abundant proteins (DAPs), including 661 proteins with increased abundance and 311 proteins with
reduced abundance, were identified in response to MCMV infection. Functional annotations of DAPs
and measurement of photosynthetic activity revealed that photosynthesis was decreased, while the
abundance of ribosomal proteins, proteins related to stress responses, oxidation-reduction and redox
homeostasis was altered significantly during MCMV infection. Two DAPs, disulfide isomerases
like protein ZmPDIL-1 and peroxiredoxin family protein ZmPrx5, were further analyzed for their
roles during MCMV infection through cucumber mosaic virus-based virus-induced gene silencing
(CMV-VIGS). The accumulation of MCMV was suppressed in ZmPDIL-1-silenced or ZmPrx5-silenced
B73 maize, suggesting ZmPDIL-1 and ZmPrx5 might enhance host susceptibility to MCMV infection."
32035249,drought response,Transcriptome analysis of maize inbred lines differing in drought tolerance provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of drought responses in roots.,"Maize (Zea mays) is an important food and forage crop, as well as an industrial raw material, that plays important roles in agriculture and national economies. Drought stress has negative effects on seed germination and seedling growth, and it decreases crop production. In this study, we selected two maize inbred lines with different drought-tolerance levels: drought-tolerant 287M and drought-sensitive 753F. The physiological results showed that drought stress resulted in a large accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in maize root cells. However, in 287M, the activity levels of the ROS scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase also increased, resulting in a higher ROS scavenging ability than 753F. We used Illumina RNA sequencing to obtain the gene expression profiles of the two maize inbred lines at the seedling stage in response to drought stress. The transcriptome data were analyzed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the drought tolerance of 287M at the gene regulatory level. The differences in drought tolerance between 287M and 753F may be associated with different ROS scavenging capabilities, signal interaction networks, and some transcription factors. Our results will aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in plant responses to drought stress."
32631406,drought response,Mapping regulatory variants controlling gene expression in drought response and tolerance in maize.,"Background: Gene expression is a key determinant of cellular response. Natural variation in gene expression bridges genetic variation to phenotypic alteration. Identification of the regulatory variants controlling the gene expression in response to drought, a major environmental threat of crop production worldwide, is of great value for drought-tolerant gene identification. 

Results: A total of 627 RNA-seq analyses are performed for 224 maize accessions which represent a wide genetic diversity under three water regimes; 73,573 eQTLs are detected for about 30,000 expressing genes with high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, reflecting a comprehensive and dynamic genetic architecture of gene expression in response to drought. The regulatory variants controlling the gene expression constitutively or drought-dynamically are unraveled. Focusing on dynamic regulatory variants resolved to genes encoding transcription factors, a drought-responsive network reflecting a hierarchy of transcription factors and their target genes is built. Moreover, 97 genes are prioritized to associate with drought tolerance due to their expression variations through the Mendelian randomization analysis. One of the candidate genes, Abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase, is verified to play a negative role in plant drought tolerance. 

Conclusions: This study unravels the effects of genetic variants on gene expression dynamics in drought response which allows us to better understand the role of distal and proximal genetic effects on gene expression and phenotypic plasticity. The prioritized drought-associated genes may serve as direct targets for functional investigation or allelic mining."
32843434,response to heat stress,The transcription factor bZIP60 links the unfolded protein response (UPR) to the heat stress response (HSR) in maize,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) and the heat shock response (HSR) are two evolutionarily conserved systems to protect plants from heat stress. The UPR and HSR occur in different cellular compartments and both responses are elicited by misfolded proteins which accumulate under adverse environmental conditions such as heat stress. While the UPR and HSR appear to operate independently, we have found a link between them in maize (Zea mays) involving the production of the bZIP60 transcription factor, a pivotal response of the UPR to heat stress. Surprisingly, a mutant (bzip60 2) knocking down bZIP60 expression blunted the HSR at elevated temperatures and prevented the normal upregulation of a group of heat shock protein (HSP) genes in response to elevated temperature. The expression of a key heat shock factor HSFTF13 (a HSFA6B family member) was compromised in bzip60-2, and the HSFTF13 promoter was shown to be a target of bZIP60 in maize protoplasts. In addition, the upregulation by heat of genes involved in chlorophyll catabolism and chloroplast protein turnover were subdued in bzip60-2, and these genes were also found to be targets of bZIP60. Thus, the UPR, an endoplasmic reticulum associated response, quite unexpectedly contributes to the nuclear/cytoplasmic heat shock response in maize."
33494250,flavonoid content; zinc content,Excess Zinc Alters Cell Wall Class III Peroxidase Activity and Flavonoid Content in the Maize Scutellum.,"Maize is one of the most important cereal crop species due to its uses for human and cattle nourishment, as well as its industrial use as a raw material. The yield and grain quality of maize depend on plant establishment, which starts with germination. Germination is dependent on embryo vigor and the stored reserves in the scutellum and endosperm. During germination, the scutellum epidermis changes and secretes enzymes and hormones into the endosperm. As a result, the hydrolysis products of the reserves and the different soluble nutrients are translocated to the scutellum through epithelial cells. Then, the reserves are directed to the embryo axis to sustain its growth. Therefore, the microenvironment surrounding the scutellum modulates its function. Zinc (Zn) is a micronutrient stored in the maize scutellum and endosperm; during imbibition, Zn from the endosperm is solubilized and mobilized towards the scutellum. During this process, Zn first becomes concentrated and interacts with cell wall charges, after which excess Zn is internalized in the vacuole. Currently, the effect of high Zn concentrations on the scutellum function and germinative processes are not known. In this paper, we show that, as a function of the concentration and time of exposure, Zn causes decreases in the radicle and plumule lengths and promotes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and flavonoids as well as changes in the activity of the cell wall Class III peroxidase (POD), which was quantified with guaiacol or catechin in the presence of H2O2. The relationship between the activity index or proportion of POD activity in the scutellum and the changes in the flavonoid concentration is proposed as a marker of stress and the state of vigor of the embryo."
33772993,male fertility,CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based discovery of maize transcription factors regulating male sterility and their functional conservation in plants,"Identifying genic male-sterility (GMS) genes and elucidating their roles are important to unveil plant male reproduction and promote their application in crop breeding. However, compared with Arabidopsis and rice, relatively fewer maize GMS genes have been discovered and little is known about their regulatory pathways underlying anther and pollen development. Here, by sequencing and analysing anther transcriptomes at 11 developmental stages in maize B73, Zheng58 and M6007 inbred lines, 1100 transcription factor (TF) genes were identified to be stably differentially expressed among different developmental stages. Among them, 14 maize TF genes (9 types belonging to five TF families) were selected and performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene mutagenesis, and then, 12 genes in eight types, including ZmbHLH51, ZmbHLH122, ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3, ZmTGA10, ZmMYB84, ZmMYB33-1/-2, ZmPHD11 and ZmLBD10/27, were identified as maize new GMS genes by using DNA sequencing, phenotypic and cytological analyses. Notably, ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3 triple-gene mutants and ZmMYB33-1/-2 double-gene mutants displayed complete male sterility, but their double- or single-gene mutants showed male fertility. Similarly, ZmLBD10/27 double-gene mutant displayed partial male sterility with 32.18% of aborted pollen grains. In addition, ZmbHLH51 was transcriptionally activated by ZmbHLH122 and their proteins were physically interacted. Molecular markers co-segregating with these GMS mutations were developed to facilitate their application in maize breeding. Finally, all 14-type maize GMS TF genes identified here and reported previously were compared on functional conservation and diversification among maize, rice and Arabidopsis. These findings enrich GMS gene and mutant resources for deeply understanding the regulatory network underlying male fertility and for creating male-sterility lines in maize."
34597584,disease response; response to Rhizoctonia solani,Ca2+ sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector.,"Plant immunity is activated upon pathogen perception and often affects growth and yield when it is constitutively active. How plants fine-tune immune homeostasis in their natural habitats remains elusive. Here, we discover a conserved immune suppression network in cereals that orchestrates immune homeostasis, centering on a Ca2+-sensor, RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 (ROD1). ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with agroecology-specific distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty. The fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence. We thus reveal a molecular framework adopted by both host and pathogen that integrates Ca2+ sensing and ROS homeostasis to suppress plant immunity, suggesting a principle for breeding disease-resistant, high-yield crops."
34837389,grain yield; ear length,Genetic variation in YIGE1 contributes to ear length and grain yield in maize,"Ear length (EL), controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL), is an important component of grain yield and as such a key target trait in maize breeding. However, very few EL QTL have been cloned and their molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, using genome wide association study (GWAS), we identified a QTL-YIGE1, which encodes an unknown protein that regulates EL by affecting pistillate floret number. Overexpression of YIGE1 enlarged female inflorescence meristem (IM) size, increased EL and kernel number per row (KNPR) thus enhanced grain yield. By contrast, CRISPR/Cas9 knock out or Mutator insertion mutant lines of YIGE1 displayed decreased IM size and EL. The SNP located in the regulatory region of YIGE1 had strong effect on its promoter strength which positively affected EL by increasing gene expression. Further analysis shows that YIGE1 may be involved in sugar and auxin signal pathways to regulate maize ear development, thus, affecting IM activity and floret production in maize inflorescence morphogenesis. These findings provide new insights of ear development and will ultimately facilitate maize molecular breeding."
35328010,response to maize rough dwarf virus,Genome-wide profiling of alternative splicing and gene fusion during rice black-streaked dwarf virus stress in maize (Zea mays L.),"Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) causes maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD), which is a viral disease that significantly affects maize yields worldwide. Plants tolerate stress through transcriptional reprogramming at the alternative splicing (AS), transcriptional, and fusion gene (FG) levels. However, it is unclear whether and how AS and FG interfere with transcriptional reprogramming in MRDD. In this study, we performed global profiling of AS and FG on maize response to RBSDV and compared it with transcriptional changes. There are approximately 1.43 to 2.25 AS events per gene in maize infected with RBSDV. GRMZM2G438622 was only detected in four AS modes (A3SS, A5SS, RI, and SE), whereas GRMZM2G059392 showed downregulated expression and four AS events. A total of 106 and 176 FGs were detected at two time points, respectively, including six differentially expressed genes and five differentially spliced genes. The gene GRMZM2G076798 was the only FG that occurred at two time points and was involved in two FG events. Among these, 104 GOs were enriched, indicating that nodulin-, disease resistance-, and chloroplastic-related genes respond to RBSDV stress in maize. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulation of maize response to RBSDV stress."
35543494,response to cold stress,The transcription factor bZIP68 negatively regulates cold tolerance in maize,"Maize (Zea mays) originated in tropical areas and is thus susceptible to low temperatures, which pose a major threat to maize production. Our understanding of the molecular basis of cold tolerance in maize is limited. Here, we identified bZIP68, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, as a negative regulator of cold tolerance in maize. Transcriptome analysis revealed that bZIP68 represses the cold-induced expression of DREB1 transcription factor genes. The stability and transcriptional activity of bZIP68 are controlled by its phosphorylation at the conserved Ser250 residue under cold stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bZIP68 locus was a target of selection during early domestication. A 358-bp insertion/deletion (Indel-972) polymorphism in the bZIP68 promoter has a significant effect on the differential expression of bZIP68 between maize and its wild ancestor teosinte. This study thus uncovers an evolutionary cis-regulatory variant that could be used to improve cold tolerance in maize."
35861696,response to salt,Transcription factor ZmWRKY20 interacts with ZmWRKY115 to repress expression of ZmbZIP111 for salt tolerance in maize,"Maize (Zea mays) is an important cereal crop worldwide. However, its yield and quality are adversely affected by salt stress resulting from soil hypersalinity. Exploring the regulatory mechanisms of stress response is vital to maize seed production. In the present study, we screened ethyl methanesulfonate-induced maize mutants and identified a salt-tolerant mutant. A single base was mutated in ZmWRKY20, leading to form a truncated protein variant. A detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that this mutant had significantly higher resistance to wilting and lower ROS levels than the inbred line B73. The ZmWRKY20 showed transcriptional activity in yeast and specifically bound W-boxes according to the results of yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays. Overexpression of ZmWRKY20 decreased salt tolerance in maize. Transcriptome profiling revealed that ZmWRKY20 overexpression extensively reprogrammed genes involved in regulating defense and oxidation-reduction responses. The results substantiated that ZmWRKY20 targeted to the basic region/leucine zipper motif directly in transcription factor ZmbZIP111. It was also verified that ZmWRKY20 interacts with ZmWRKY115 and both proteins act jointly to enhance ZmbZIP111 repression. The results indicated that the ZmWRKY20 and ZmWRKY115 transcriptional factors interact in the nucleus, leading to repress ZmbZIP111 by directly binding its promoter, and increase the sensitivity of maize seedlings to salt stress. The current presentation facilitates our comprehensive understanding of the complicated responses of maize to salt stress."
35867182,response to iron; response to Curvularia leaf spot,Iron redistribution induces oxidative burst and resistance in maize against Curvularia lunata,"Iron is an indispensable co-factor of various crucial enzymes that are involved in cellular metabolic processes and energy metabolism in eukaryotes. For this reason, plants and pathogens compete for iron to maintain their iron homeostasis, respectively. In our previous study, &#916;Clnps6, the extracellular siderophore biosynthesis deletion mutant of Curvularia lunata, was sensitive to exogenous hydrogen peroxide and virulence reduction. However, the mechanism was not studied. Here, we report that maize B73 displayed highly resistance to &#916;Clnps6. The plants recruited more iron at cell wall appositions (CWAs) to cause ROS bursts. Intracellular iron deficiency induced by iron redistribution originated form up-regulated expression of genes involved in intracellular iron consumption in leaves and absorption in roots. The RNA-sequencing data also showed that the expression of respiratory burst oxidase homologue (ZmRBOH4) and NADP-dependent malic enzyme 4 (ZmNADP-ME4) involved in ROS production was up-regulated in maize B73 after &#916;Clnps6 infection. Simultaneously, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis genes lipoxygenase (ZmLOX), allene oxide synthase (ZmAOS), GA degradation gene gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase (ZmGA2OX6) and ABA degradation genes abscisic acid hydroxylase (ZmABH1, ZmABH2) involved in iron homeostasis were up-regulated expression. Ferritin1 (ZmFER1) positive regulated maize resistance against C. lunata via ROS burst under Fe-limiting conditions. Overall, our results showed that iron played vital roles in activating maize resistance in B73-C. lunata interaction."
35890433,root development,Growing maize root: Lectins involved in consecutive stages of cell development,"Proteins that carry specific carbohydrate-binding lectin domains have a great variety and are ubiquitous across the plant kingdom. In turn, the plant cell wall has a complex carbohydrate composition, which is subjected to constant changes in the course of plant development. In this regard, proteins with lectin domains are of great interest in the context of studying their contribution to the tuning and monitoring of the cell wall during its modifications in the course of plant organ development. We performed a genome-wide screening of lectin motifs in the Zea mays genome and analyzed the transcriptomic data from five zones of primary maize root with cells at different development stages. This allowed us to obtain 306 gene sequences encoding putative lectins and to relate their expressions to the stages of root cell development and peculiarities of cell wall metabolism. Among the lectins whose expression was high and differentially regulated in growing maize root were the members of the EUL, dirigent��jacalin, malectin, malectin-like, GNA and Nictaba families, many of which are predicted as cell wall proteins or lectin receptor-like kinases that have direct access to the cell wall. Thus, a set of molecular players was identified with high potential to play important roles in the early stages of root morphogenesis."
35893627,response to heavy metals,Lead and zinc uptake and toxicity in maize and their management,"Soil contamination with heavy metals is a global problem, and these metals can reach the food chain through uptake by plants, endangering human health. Among the metal pollutants in soils, zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) are common co-pollutants from anthropogenic activities. Thus, we sought to define the accumulation of Zn and Pb in agricultural soils and maize. Concentrations of Pb in agricultural soil (in Namibia) could reach 3015 mg/Kg, whereas concentrations of Zn in soil (in China) could reach 1140 mg/Kg. In addition, the maximum concentrations of Zn and Pb were 27,870 and 2020 mg/Kg in maize roots and 4180 and 6320 mg/Kg in shoots, respectively. Recent studies have shown that soil properties (such as organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), texture, and clay content) can play important roles in the bioavailability of Zn and Pb. We also investigated some of the genes and proteins involved in the uptake and transport of Zn and Pb by maize. Among several amendment methods to reduce the bioavailability of Zn and Pb in soils, the use of biochar, bioremediation, and the application of gypsum and lime have been widely reported as effective methods for reducing the accumulation of metals in soils and plants."
36005383,response to Fusarium ear rot,Engineering null mutants in ZmFER1 confers resistance to ear rot caused by Fusarium verticillioides in maize.,"Fusarium ear rot (FER), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium spp., leads to great yield losses to maize worldwide and to mycotoxin contamination, which seriously threatens human and animal health (Yao et al., 2020). FER has become an especially serious problem in maize– wheat rotation systems because the major causal agent can also lead to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat (Li et al., 2019). Employing resistant cultivars is the most effective method for controlling FER but is currently limited to only a few resistance genes. Fhb1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FHB resistance, was cloned recently (Li et al., 2019; Su et al., 2019). Although the reported resistance mechanisms were controversial, TaHRC underlying Fhb1 was confirmed to be a susceptibility gene; a 752-bp deletion in this gene led to a loss of susceptibility (Li et al., 2019; Su et al., 2019). Knockout of the susceptible TaHRC allele improved FHB resistance (Chen et al., 2022; Su et al., 2019). Because FER and FHB could be caused by the same fungus (Li et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2020), we hypothesized that engineering TaHRC homologs in maize could represent a novel approach to FER resistance breeding."
36070002,stem development,A spatiotemporal transcriptomic network dynamically modulates stalk development in maize,"Maize (Zea mays) is an important cereal crop with suitable stalk formation which is beneficial for acquiring an ideal agronomic trait to resist lodging and higher planting density. The elongation pattern of stalks arises from the variable growth of individual internodes driven by cell division and cellexpansion comprising the maize stalk. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and regulatory network of the maize stalk development and differentiation process remain unclear. Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomes using all internodes of the whole stalks from developing maize at the elongation and maturation stages. We identified four distinct groups corresponding to four developmental zones and nine specific clusters with diverse spatiotemporal expression patterns among individual internodes of the stalk. Through weighted gene coexpression network (WGCN) analysis, we constructed transcriptional regulatory networks at a fine spatiotemporal resolution and uncovered key modules and candidate genes involved in internode maintenance, elongation and division that determine stalk length and thickness in maize. Further CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout validated the function of a cytochrome P450 gene, ZmD1, in the regulation of stalk length and thickness as predicted by the WGCN. Collectively, these results provide insights into the high genetic complexity of stalk development and the potential valuable resources with ideal stalk lengths and widths for genetic improvements in maize."
36072324,response to cold stress; germination index,Using a high density bin map to analyze quantitative trait locis of germination ability of maize at low temperatures,"Low temperatures in the spring often lead to a decline in the emergence rate and uniformity of maize, which can affect yield in northern regions. This study used 365 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which arose from crossing Qi319 and Ye478, to identify low-temperature resistance during the germination stage by measuring eight low-temperature-related traits. The quantitative trait locis (QTLs) were mapped using R/qtl software by combining phenotypic data, and the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method to produce a high-density genetic linkage map. Twenty QTLs were detected during QTL mapping, of which seven QTLs simultaneously detected a consistent 197.10-202.30 Mb segment on chromosome 1. The primary segment was named cQTL1-2, with a phenotypic variation of 5.18-25.96% and a physical distance of 5.2 Mb. This combines the phenotype and genotype with the identification of seven chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), which were derived from Ye478*Qi319 and related to cQTL1-2. The physical distance of cQTL1-2 was reduced to approximately 1.9 Mb. The consistent meta-QTL mQTL1 was located at 619.06 cM on chromosome 1, had a genetic distance of 7.27 cM, and overlapped with cQTL1-2. This was identified by combining the results of previous QTL studies assessing maize tolerance to low temperatures at the germination stage. An assessment of the results of the RIL population, CSSLs, and mQTL1 found the consistent QTL to be LtQTL1-1. It was identified in bin1.06-1.07 at a confidence interval of between 200,400,148 and 201,775,619 bp. In this interval, qRT-PCR found that relative expression of the candidate genes GRMZM2G082630 and GRMZM2G115730 were both up-regulated in low-temperature tolerant lines and down-regulated in sensitive lines (P < 0.01)."
36073937,response to Striga,Genome-wide association studies of <i>Striga</i> resistance in extra-early maturing quality protein maize inbred lines,"Identification of genes associated with Striga resistance is invaluable for accelerating genetic gains in breeding for Striga resistance in maize. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions associated with grain yield and other agronomic traits under artificial Striga field infestation. One hundred and forty-one extra-early quality protein maize (QPM) inbred lines were phenotyped for key agronomic traits. The inbred lines were also genotyped using 49,185 DArTseq markers from which 8,143 were retained for population structure analysis and Genome Wide-Association Study (GWAS). Cluster analysis and population structure revealed the presence three well defined genetic groups. Using the mixed linear model, twenty-two SNP markers were identified to be significantly associated with grain yield, Striga damage at 10 weeks after planting (WAP), number of emerged Striga plants at 8 and 10 WAP and ear aspect. The identified SNP markers would be useful for breeders for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to accelerate genetic enhancement of maize for Striga resistance in sub-Saharan Africa after validation."
36079583,response to armyworm,Production of the Green Leaf Volatile (Z)-3-Hexenal by a Zea mays Hydroperoxide Lyase,"Plant-produced volatile compounds play important roles in plant signaling and in the communication of plants with other organisms. Many plants emit green leaf volatiles (GLVs) in response to damage or attack, which serve to warn neighboring plants or attract predatory or parasitic insects to help defend against insect pests. GLVs include aldehydes, esters, and alcohols of 6-carbon compounds that are released rapidly following wounding. One GLV produced by maize (Zea mays) is the volatile (Z)-3-hexenal; this volatile is produced from the cleavage of (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid by hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) of the cytochrome P450 CYP74B family. The specific HPL in maize involved in (Z)-3-hexenal production had not been determined. In this study, we used phylogenetics with known HPLs from other species to identify a candidate HPL from maize (ZmHPL). To test the ability of the putative HPL to produce (Z)-3-hexenal, we constitutively expressed the gene in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 that contains a natural loss-of-function mutant in AtHPL and examined the transgenic plants for restored (Z)-3-hexenal production. Volatile analysis of leaves from these transgenic plants showed that they did produce (Z)-3-hexenal, confirming that ZmHPL can produce (Z)-3-hexenal in vivo. Furthermore, we used gene expression analysis to show that expression of ZmHPL is induced in maize in response to both wounding and the insect pests Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodoptera exigua. Our study demonstrates that ZmHPL can produce GLVs and highlights its likely role in (Z)-3-hexenal production in response to mechanical damage and herbivory in maize."
36098668,photosynthetic efficiency,Increased bundle sheath leakiness of CO2 during photosynthetic induction shows a lack of coordination between the C4 and C3 cycles.,"Use of a complete dynamic model of NADP-ME C4 photosynthesis indicated during dark or shade to high-light transitions induction of the C4 pathway was more rapid than that of the C3 , resulting in a predicted transient increase in bundle-sheath CO2 leakiness (ϕ) Previously, ϕ was measured at steady-state, here we developed a new method, coupling a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscope (TDL) with a gas exchange system, to track ϕ in sorghum and maize through the non-steady-state condition of photosynthetic induction. In both species, ϕ showed a transient increase to >0.35 before declining to a steady-state of 0.2 by 1500 s after illumination. Average ϕ was 60% higher than at steady-state over the first 600 s of induction and 30% higher over the first 1500 s. The transient increase in ϕ, which was consistent with the model prediction, indicated that capacity to assimilate CO2 into the C3 cycle in the bundle-sheath failed to keep pace with the rate of dicarboxylate delivery by the C4 cycle. Because non-steady-state light conditions are the norm in field canopies, the results suggest that ϕ in these major crops in the field is significantly higher and energy conversion efficiency lower than previous measured values under steady-state conditions."
36113675,leaf angle,ZmDWF1 regulates leaf angle in maize,"Leaf angle (LA) is a critical agronomic trait enhancing grain yield under high-density planting in maize. A number of researches have been conducted in recent years to investigate the quantitative trait loci/genes responsible for LA variation, while only a few genes were identified through map-based cloning. Here we cloned the ZmDWF1 gene, which was previously reported to encode Δ24-sterol reductase in the brassinosteroids (BRs) biosynthesis pathway. Overexpression of ZmDWF1 resulted in enlarged LA, indicating that ZmDWF1 is a positive regulator of LA in maize. To reveal the regulatory framework of ZmDWF1, we conducted RNA-Sequencing and yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screening analysis. RNA-Sequencing analyzing results indicate ZmDWF1 mainly affected expression level of genes involved in cell wall associated metabolism and hormone metabolism including BR, gibberellin, and auxin. Y2H screening with Bi-FC assay confirmed three proteins (ZmPP2C-1, ZmROF1, and ZmTWD1) interacting with ZmDWF1. We revealed a new regulatory network of ZmDWF1 gene in controlling plant architecture in maize."
36114820,response to salt,A teosinte-derived allele of an HKT1 family sodium transporter improves salt tolerance in maize,"The sodium cation (Na+ ) is the predominant cation with deleterious effects on crops in salt-affected agricultural areas. Salt tolerance of crop can be improved by increasing shoot Na+ exclusion. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and use genetic variants of various crops that promote shoot Na+ exclusion. Here, we show that a HKT1 family gene ZmNC3 (Zea mays L. Na+ Content 3; designated ZmHKT1;2) confers natural variability in shoot-Na+ accumulation and salt tolerance in maize. ZmHKT1;2 encodes a Na+ -preferential transporter localized in the plasma membrane, which mediates shoot Na+ exclusion, likely by withdrawing Na+ from the root xylem flow. A naturally occurring nonsynonymous SNP (SNP947-G) increases the Na+ transport activity of ZmHKT1;2, promoting shoot Na+ exclusion and salt tolerance in maize. SNP947-G first occurred in the wild grass teosinte (at a allele frequency of 43%) and has become a minor allele in the maize population (allele frequency 6.1%), suggesting that SNP947-G is derived from teosinte and that the genomic region flanking SNP947 likely has undergone selection during domestication or post-domestication dispersal of maize. Moreover, we demonstrate that introgression of the SNP947-G ZmHKT1;2 allele into elite maize germplasms reduces shoot Na+ content by up to 80% and promotes salt tolerance. Taken together, ZmNC3/ZmHKT1;2 was identified as an important QTL promoting shoot Na+ exclusion, and its favorable allele provides an effective tool for developing salt-tolerant maize varieties."
36127632,grain yield,Genome wide association analysis for yield related traits in maize,"Background: Understanding the genetic basis of yield related traits contributes to the improvement of grain yield in maize.

Results: Using 291 excellent maize inbred lines as materials, six yield related traits of maize, including grain yield per plant (GYP), grain length (GL), grain width (GW), kernel number per row (KNR), 100 kernel weight (HKW) and tassel branch number (TBN) were investigated in Jinan, in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The average values of three environments were taken as the phenotypic data of yield related traits, and they were statistically analyzed. Based on 38,683 high-quality SNP markers in the whole genome of the association panel, the MLM with PCA model was used for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to obtain 59 significantly associated SNP sites. Moreover, 59 significantly associated SNPs (P < 0.0001) referring to GYP, GL, GW, KNR, HKW and TBN, of which 14 SNPs located in yield related QTLs/QTNs previously reported. A total of 66 candidate genes were identified based on the 59 significantly associated SNPs, of which 58 had functional annotation.

Conclusions: Using genome-wide association analysis strategy to identify genetic loci related to maize yield, a total of 59 significantly associated SNP were detected. Those results aid in our understanding of the genetic architecture of maize yield and provide useful SNPs for genetic improvement of maize."
36131495,response to Gibberella ear rot,A combination of QTL mapping and GradedPool-Seq to dissect genetic complexity for Gibberella ear rot resistance in maize using an IBM Syn10 DH population,"Gibberella ear rot (GER) caused by Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is one of the most devastating maize diseases that reducing grain yield and quality worldwide. Utilization of host genetic resistance has become one of the most suitable strategy to control GER. In this study, a set of 246 diverse inbred lines derived from the intermated B73 × Mo17 doubled haploid population (IBM Syn10 DH) were used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to GER. Meanwhile, a GradedPool-Seq (GPS) appoach was performed to identify genomic variations involving in GER resistance. Using artificial inoculation across multiple environments, GER severity of the population was observed with wide phenotypic variation. Based on the linkage mapping, a total of 14 resistant QTLs were detected, accounting for 5.11-14.87% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. In GPS analysis, five significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated GER resistance were identified. Combining QTL mapping and GPS analysis, a peak-value SNP on chromosome 4 from GPS was overlapped with the QTL qGER4.2, suggesting that the co-localized region could be the most possible target location conferring resistance to GER. Subsequently, seven candidate genes were identified within the peak SNP, linking to GER resistance. These findings are useful for exploration the complicated genetic variations in maize GER resistance. The genomic regions and genes identified herein provide a list of candidate targets for further investigation, in addition to the combined strategy that can be used for quantitative traits in plant species."
36140800,nitrogen content,GWAS and Transcriptome Analysis Reveal Key Genes Affecting Root Growth under Low Nitrogen Supply in Maize,"Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important factors affecting crop production. Root morphology exhibits a high degree of plasticity to nitrogen deficiency. However, the mechanisms underlying the root foraging response under low-N conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed 213 maize inbred lines using hydroponic systems and regarding their natural variations in 22 root traits and 6 shoot traits under normal (2 mM nitrate) and low-N (0 mM nitrate) conditions. Substantial phenotypic variations were detected for all traits. N deficiency increased the root length and decreased the root diameter and shoot related traits. A total of 297 significant marker-trait associations were identified by a genome-wide association study involving different N levels and the N response value. A total of 51 candidate genes with amino acid variations in coding regions or differentially expressed under low nitrogen conditions were identified. Furthermore, a candidate gene ZmNAC36 was resequenced in all tested lines. A total of 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 12 insertions and deletions were significantly associated with lateral root length of primary root, primary root length between 0 and 0.5 mm in diameter, primary root surface area, and total length of primary root under a low-N condition. These findings help us to improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism of root plasticity to N deficiency, and the identified loci and candidate genes will be useful for the genetic improvement of maize tolerance cultivars to N deficiency."
36155239,kernel size,Evolutionary characterization of miR396s in Poaceae exemplified by their genetic effects in wheat and maize,"MiR396s play important roles in regulating plant growth and stress response, and great potential for crop yield promotion was anticipated. For more comprehensive and precise understanding of miR396s in Poaceae, we analyzed the phylogenetic linkage, gene expression, and chromosomal distribution of miR396s in this study. Although the mature miR396sNULL sequences were mostly conserved, differential expression patterns and chromosomal distribution were found among Poaceae species including the major cereal crops rice, wheat, and maize. Consistently, in comparison with rice, wheat and maize plants transformed with the target mimicry construct of miR396 (MIM396) exhibited differential effects on grain size and disease resistance. While the TaMIM396 plants showed increased grain size, panicle length and sensitivity to B. graminis, the ZmMIM396 plants didn't show obvious changes in grain size and disease resistance. In Addition, several GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) genes in wheat and maize were repressed by miR396s, which could be reversed by MIM396, confirming the conserved regulatory roles of miR396 on GRFs. While providing new solution to enhance grain yield in wheat and revealing potential regulatory variations of miR396s in controlling grain size and disease resistance in different crops, this study gives clues to further explore miR396sNULL functions in other Poaceae species."
36161933,gravitropism,Leveraging orthology within maize and Arabidopsis QTL to identify genes affecting natural variation in gravitropism,"Plants typically orient their organs with respect to the Earth's gravity field by a dynamic process called gravitropism. To discover conserved genetic elements affecting seedling root gravitropism, we measured the process in a set of Zea mays (maize) recombinant inbred lines with machine vision and compared the results with those obtained in a similar study of Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of the several quantitative trait loci that we mapped in both species spanned many hundreds of genes, too many to test individually for causality. We reasoned that orthologous genes may be responsible for natural variation in monocot and dicot root gravitropism. If so, pairs of orthologous genes affecting gravitropism may be present within the maize and Arabidopsis QTL intervals. A reciprocal comparison of sequences within the QTL intervals identified seven pairs of such one-to-one orthologs. Analysis of knockout mutants demonstrated a role in gravitropism for four of the seven: CCT2 functions in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, ATG5 functions in membrane remodeling during autophagy, UGP2 produces the substrate for cellulose and callose polymer extension, and FAMA is a transcription factor. Automated phenotyping enabled this discovery of four naturally varying components of a conserved process (gravitropism) by making it feasible to conduct the same large-scale experiment in two species.<p> Significance: Plants use the Earth’s gravitational field to orient their growth, but there are large gaps in our understanding of the mechanism. We measured thousands of corn seedling roots, changing their growth direction in response to gravity (gravitropism) with machine vision methods, and we used genetic information about the seedlings to coarsely map the genomic positions of influential genes. Because we had previously performed the same experiment with the distantly related Arabidopsis plant, we could use a gene-relatedness search to pinpoint only those genes residing within the relevant regions of the genome in both species. Follow-up tests verified the identity of four genes that modify root gravitropism. The new information could help us understand how gravity shapes root system architectures."
36173348,days to flowering,The evening complex promotes maize flowering and adaptation to temperate regions,"Maize (Zea mays) originated in southern Mexico and has spread over a wide latitudinal range. Maize expansion from tropical to temperate regions has necessitated a reduction of its photoperiod sensitivity. In this study, we cloned a quantitative trait locus (QTL) regulating flowering time in maize and show that the maize ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana EARLY FLOWERING3, ZmELF3.1, is the causal locus. We demonstrate that ZmELF3.1 and ZmELF3.2 proteins can physically interact with ZmELF4.1/4.2 and ZmLUX1/2, to form evening complex(es) (EC) in the maize circadian clock. Loss-of-function mutants for ZmELF3.1/3.2 and ZmLUX1/2 exhibited delayed flowering under long-day and short-day conditions. We show that EC directly represses the expression of several flowering suppressor genes, such as the CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1 (CCT) genes ZmCCT9 and ZmCCT10, ZmCONSTANS-LIKE 3, and the PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) genes ZmPRR37a and ZmPRR73, thus alleviating their inhibition, allowing florigen gene expression and promoting flowering. Further, we identify two closely linked retrotransposons located in the ZmELF3.1 promoter that regulate the expression levels of ZmELF3.1 and may have been positively selected during post-domestication spread of maize from tropical to temperate regions during the pre-Columbian era. These findings provide insights into circadian clock-mediated regulation of photoperiodic flowering in maize and new targets of genetic improvement for breeding."
36175574,kernel size,A NAC-EXPANSIN module enhances maize kernel size by controlling nucellus elimination,"Maize early endosperm development is initiated in coordination with elimination of maternal nucellar tissues. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we characterize a major quantitative trait locus for maize kernel size and weight that encodes an EXPANSIN gene, ZmEXPB15. The encoded β-expansin protein is expressed specifically in nucellus, and positively controls kernel size and weight by promoting nucellus elimination. We further show that two nucellus-enriched transcription factors (TFs), ZmNAC11 and ZmNAC29, activate ZmEXPB15 expression. Accordingly, these two TFs also promote kernel size and weight through nucellus elimination regulation, and genetic analyses support their interaction with ZmEXPB15. Importantly, hybrids derived from a ZmEXPB15 overexpression line have increased kernel weight, demonstrates its potential value in breeding. Together, we reveal a pathway modulating the cellular processes of maternal nucellus elimination and early endosperm development, and an approach to improve kernel weight."
36180833,cytoplasmic male sterility,Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes of maize CMS-S subtypes provides new insights into male sterility stability,"Background: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a trait of economic importance in the production of hybrid seeds. In CMS-S maize, exerted anthers appear frequently in florets of field-grown female populations where only complete male-sterile plants were expected. It has been reported that these reversions are associated with the loss of sterility-conferring regions or other rearrangements in the mitochondrial genome. However, the relationship between mitochondrial function and sterility stability is largely unknown. 
Results: In this study, we determined the ratio of plants carrying exerted anthers in the population of two CMS-S subtypes. The subtype with a high ratio of exerted anthers was designated as CMS-Sa, and the other with low ratio was designated as CMS-Sb. Through next-generation sequencing, we assembled and compared mitochondrial genomes of two CMS-S subtypes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed strong similarities between the two mitochondrial genomes. The sterility-associated regions, S plasmids, and terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) were intact in both genomes. The two subtypes maintained high transcript levels of the sterility gene orf355 in anther tissue. Most of the functional genes/proteins were identical at the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence levels in the two subtypes, except for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1). In the mitochondrial genome of CMS-Sb, a 3.3-kilobase sequence containing nad1-exon1 was absent from the second copy of the 17-kb repeat region. Consequently, we detected two copies of nad1-exon1 in CMS-Sa, but only one copy in CMS-Sb. During pollen development, nad1 transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis were induced in anthers of CMS-Sa, but not in those of CMS-Sb. We suggest that the impaired mitochondrial function in the anthers of CMS-Sb is associated with its more stable sterility. 
Conclusions: Comprehensive analyses revealed diversity in terms of the copy number of the mitochondrial gene nad1-exon1 between two subtypes of CMS-S maize. This difference in copy number affected the transcript levels of nad1 and mitochondrial biogenesis in anther tissue, and affected the reversion rate of CMS-S maize. The results of this study suggest the involvement of mitochondrial robustness in modulation of sterility stability in CMS-S maize."
36180934,response to Exserohilum turcicum,"The northern corn leaf blight resistance gene Ht1 encodes an nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptor.","Northern corn leaf blight, caused by the fungal pathogen Exserohilum turcicum, is a major disease of maize. The first major locus conferring resistance to E. turcicum race 0, Ht1, was identified over 50 years ago, but the underlying gene has remained unknown. We employed a map-based cloning strategy to identify the Ht1 causal gene, which was found to be a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene, which we named PH4GP-Ht1. Transgenic testing confirmed that introducing the native PH4GP-Ht1 sequence to a susceptible maize variety resulted in resistance to E. turcicum race 0. A survey of the maize nested association mapping genomes revealed that susceptible Ht1 alleles had very low to no expression of the gene. Overexpression of the susceptible B73 allele, however, did not result in resistant plants, indicating that sequence variations may underlie the difference between resistant and susceptible phenotypes. Modelling of the PH4GP-Ht1 protein indicated that it has structural homology to the Arabidopsis NLR resistance gene ZAR1, and probably forms a similar homopentamer structure following activation. RNA sequencing data from an infection time course revealed that 1 week after inoculation there was a threefold reduction in fungal biomass in the PH4GP-Ht1 transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants. Furthermore, PH4GP-Ht1 transgenics had significantly more inoculation-responsive differentially expressed genes than wild-type plants, with enrichment seen in genes associated with both defence and photosynthesis. These results demonstrate that the NLR PH4GP-Ht1 is the causal gene underlying Ht1, which represents a different mode of action compared to the previously reported wall-associated kinase northern corn leaf blight resistance gene Htn1/Ht2/Ht3."
36184182,"drought response; amylose content, kernel starch",The effects of drought treatments on biosynthesis and structure of maize starches with different amylose content.,"We investigated the effects of drought stress (DS) on maize varieties with different amylose content (AC). In starches with AC of 33 %, DS increased the contents of amylopectin (AP) chains with a degree of polymerization (DP) > 36 and decreased the AP chains with DP ≤ 36, while the AC was unchanged. DS decreased the crystallinity, the thickness of both amorphous and crystalline lamellae, and average granular size. In contrast, the digestibility increased. For starches with AC of 45 %, DS increased the content of AP chains with DP > 24 and AC, while the contents of AP chains with DP ≤ 24 decreased. DS produced starch with thinner crystalline lamellae, thicker amorphous lamellae, more elongated and larger granules. The digestibility of the starches decreased. In starches with AC of 53 %, moderate DS led to similar structural and functional changes as found for starches with AC of 45 %. Finally, severe DS resulted in the decrease of AC."
36194012,hormone response,Maize Seedling Growth and Hormone Response Assays Using the Rolled Towel Method,"Root system architecture is a critical factor in maize health and stress resilience. Determining the genetic and environmental factors that shape maize root system architecture is an active research area. However, the ability to phenotype juvenile root systems is hindered by the use of field-grown and soil-based systems. An alternative to soil- and field-based growing conditions for maize seedlings is a controlled environment with a soil-free medium, which can facilitate root system phenotyping. Here, we describe how to grow maize under soil-free conditions for up to 12 days to facilitate root phenotyping. Maize seeds are sterilized and planted on specialized seed germination paper to minimize fungal contamination and ensure synchronized seedling growth, followed by imaging at the desired time point. The root images are then analyzed to quantify traits of interest, such as primary root length, lateral root density, seminal root length, and seminal root number. In addition, juvenile shoot traits can be quantified using manual annotation methods. We also outline the steps for performing rigorous hormone response assays for four classical phytohormones: auxin, brassinosteroid, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid. This protocol can be rapidly scaled up and is compatible with genetic screens and sample collection for downstream molecular analyses such as transcriptomics and proteomics."
36217105,disease response,Functional analysis revealed the involvement of ZmABCB15 in resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf virus infection,"Background: Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD), caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) belonging to the Fijivirus genus, seriously threatens maize production worldwide. Three susceptible varieties (Ye478, Zheng 58, and Zhengdan 958) and two resistant varieties (P138 and Chang7-2) were used in our study. 

Results: A set of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB) transporter genes were screened to evaluate their possible involvements in RBSDV resistance. In the present study, ZmABCB15, an ABCB transporter family member, was cloned and functionally identified. Expression analysis showed that ZmABCB15 was significantly induced in the resistant varieties, not in the susceptible varieties, suggesting its involvement in resistance to the RBSDV infection. ZmABCB15 gene encodes a putative polar auxin transporter containing two trans-membrane domains and two P-loop nucleotide-binding domains. Transient expression analysis indicated that ZmABCB15 is a cell membrance localized protein. Over-expression of ZmABCB15 enhanced the resistance by repressing the RBSDV replication ratio. ZmABCB15 might participate in the RBSDV resistance by affecting the homeostasis of active and inactive auxins in RBSDV infected seedlings. 

Conclusions: Polar auxin transport might participate in the RBSDV resistance by affecting the distribution of endogenous auxin among tissues. Our data showed the involvement of polar auxin transport in RBSDV resistance and provided novel mechanism underlying the auxin-mediated disease control technology."
36223073,cytoplasmic male sterility; salinity tolerance,"<i>ORF355</i>
            confers enhanced salinity stress adaptability to CMS‐S maize by modulating the mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis","Moderate stimuli in mitochondria improve wide-ranging stress adaptability in animals, but whether mitochondria play similar roles in plants is largely unknown. Here, we report the enhanced stress adaptability of S-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-S) maize and its association with mild expression of sterilizing gene ORF355. A CMS-S maize line exhibited superior growth potential and higher yield than those of the near-isogenic N-type line in saline fields. Moderate expression of ORF355 induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activated the cellular antioxidative defense system. This adaptive response was mediated by elevation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration and associated metabolic homeostasis. Metabolome analysis revealed broad metabolic changes in CMS-S lines, even in the absence of salinity stress. Metabolic products associated with amino acid metabolism and galactose metabolism were substantially changed, which underpinned the alteration of the antioxidative defense system in CMS-S plants. The results reveal the ORF355-mediated superior stress adaptability in CMS-S maize and might provide an important route to developing salt-tolerant maize varieties."
36225880,phenolic content; carotenoid content,"Diversity of the Peruvian Andean maize (Zea mays L.) race Cabanita: Polyphenols, carotenoids, in vitro antioxidant capacity, and physical characteristics","The high diversity of the Peruvian Andean maize (Zea mays L.) represents a biological and genetic heritage relevant for food security, but few studies are targeted toward its characterization and consequent valorization and preservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of the Peruvian Andean maize race Cabanita with respect to its bioactive profiles (free and bound phenolic and carotenoid composition), physical characteristics, and in vitro antioxidant properties. Maize landraces with variable kernel pigmentation were collected from two provinces (Caylloma and Castilla) within the Arequipa region (among ten Andean sites) and the phytochemical profile was evaluated by Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with diode array detector (UHPLC-DAD). All maize samples were important sources of phenolic compounds mainly soluble p-coumaric and ferulic acid derivatives whereas anthocyanins were only detected in maize with partially red pigmented kernels. Major phenolic compounds in the bound phenolic fractions were ferulic acid and its derivatives along with p-coumaric acid. Carotenoid compounds including xanthophylls such as lutein, lutein isomers, and zeaxanthin were only detected in orange and white-yellow pigmented maize and are reported for the first time in Peruvian landraces. The multivariate analysis using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed low variability of all data which may indicate a level of similarity among maize samples based on evaluated variables. However, maize grown in Caylloma province showed more homogeneous physical characteristics and higher yield, whereas higher phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity were observed in maize from Castilla. Samples CAY (yellow-pigmented kernel, Castilla) and COM (orange-pigmented kernel, Caylloma) had the highest total phenolic (246.7 mg/100 g dried weight basis, DW) and carotenoid (1.95 μg/g DW) contents among all samples. The variable Andean environmental conditions along with differences in farming practices may play a role and should be confirmed with further studies. Current results provide the metabolomic basis for future research using integrated omics platforms targeted toward the complete characterization of the ethnic-relevant maize race Cabanita."
36226300,root morphology; response to heavy metals,Association mapping uncovers maize ZmbZIP107 regulating root system architecture and lead absorption under lead stress,"Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic contaminant to living organisms and the environment. Excessive Pb in soils affects crop yield and quality, thus threatening human health via the food chain. Herein, we investigated Pb tolerance among a maize association panel using root bushiness (BSH) under Pb treatment as an indicator. Through a genome-wide association study of relative BSH, we identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 30 candidate genes associated with Pb tolerance in maize seedlings. Transcriptome analysis showed that four of the 30 genes were differentially responsive to Pb treatment between two maize lines with contrasting Pb tolerance. Among these, the ZmbZIP107 transcription factor was confirmed as the key gene controlling maize tolerance to Pb by using gene-based association studies. Two 5' UTR_variants in ZmbZIP107 affected its expression level and Pb tolerance among different maize lines. ZmbZIP107 protein was specifically targeted to the nucleus and ZmbZIP107 mRNA showed the highest expression in maize seedling roots among different tissues. Heterologous expression of ZmbZIP107 enhanced rice tolerance to Pb stress and decreased Pb absorption in the roots. Our study provided the basis for revelation of the molecular mechanism underlying Pb tolerance and contributed to cultivation of Pb-tolerant varieties in maize."
36229611,drought response; grain yield,The role of transposon inverted repeats in balancing drought tolerance and yield-related traits in maize,"The genomic basis underlying the selection for environmental adaptation and yield-related traits in maize remains poorly understood. Here we carried out genome-wide profiling of the small RNA (sRNA) transcriptome (sRNAome) and transcriptome landscapes of a global maize diversity panel under dry and wet conditions and uncover dozens of environment-specific regulatory hotspots. Transgenic and molecular studies of Drought-Related Environment-specific Super eQTL Hotspot on chromosome 8 (DRESH8) and ZmMYBR38, a target of DRESH8-derived small interfering RNAs, revealed a transposable element-mediated inverted repeats (TE-IR)-derived sRNA- and gene-regulatory network that balances plant drought tolerance with yield-related traits. A genome-wide scan revealed that TE-IRs associate with drought response and yield-related traits that were positively selected and expanded during maize domestication. These results indicate that TE-IR-mediated posttranscriptional regulation is a key molecular mechanism underlying the tradeoff between crop environmental adaptation and yield-related traits, providing potential genomic targets for the breeding of crops with greater stress tolerance but uncompromised yield."
36247610,response to heat stress,"ZmNAC074, a maize stress-responsive NAC transcription factor, confers heat stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis","The harsh environment such as high temperature greatly limits the growth, development and production of crops worldwide. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) play key regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses of plants. However, the functional roles of NAC TFs in heat stress response of maize remain elusive. In our present study, we identified and isolated a stress-responsive NAC transcription factor gene in maize, designated as ZmNAC074 and orthologous with rice OsNTL3. Further studies revealed that ZmNAC074 may encode a membrane-bound transcription factor (MTF) of NAC family in maize, which is comprised of 517 amino acid residues with a transmembrane domain at the C-terminus. Moreover, ZmNAC074 was highly expressed and induced by various abiotic stresses in maize seedlings, especially in leaf tissues under heat stress. Through generating ZmNAC074 transgenic plants, phenotypic and physiological analyses further displayed that overexpression of ZmNAC074 in transgenic Arabidopsis confers enhanced heat stress tolerance significantly through modulating the accumulation of a variety of stress metabolites, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidants, malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, soluble protein, chlorophyll and carotenoid. Further, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of most ROS scavenging and HSR- and UPR-associated genes in transgenic Arabidopsis were significantly up-regulated under heat stress treatments, suggesting that ZmNAC074 may encode a positive regulator that activates the expression of ROS-scavenging genes and HSR- and UPR-associated genes to enhance plant thermotolerance under heat stress conditions. Overall, our present study suggests that ZmNAC074 may play a crucial role in conferring heat stress tolerance in plants, providing a key candidate regulatory gene for heat stress tolerance regulation and genetic improvement in maize as well as in other crops."
36271945,response to Fusarium stalk rot,Identification and validation of a key genomic region on chromosome 6 for resistance to Fusarium stalk rot in tropical maize.,"A key genomic region was identified for resistance to FSR at 168 Mb on chromosome 6 in GWAS and haplotype regression analysis, which was validated by QTL mapping in two populations. Fusarium stalk rot (FSR) of maize is an economically important post-flowering stalk rot (PFSR) disease caused by Fusarium verticillioides. The pathogen invades the plant individually, or in combination with other stalk rot pathogens or secondary colonizers, thereby making it difficult to make accurate selection for resistance. For identification and validation of genomic regions associated with FSR resistance, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted with 342 maize lines. The panel was screened for FSR in three environments using standard artificial inoculation methodology. GWAS using the mixed linear model corrected for population structure and kinship was done, in which 290,626 SNPs from genotyping-by-sequencing were used. A total of 7 SNPs, five on chromosome 6 showing strong LD at 168 Mb, were identified to be associated with FSR. Haplotype regression analysis identified 32 haplotypes with a significant effect on the trait. In a QTL mapping experiment in two populations for validating the identified variants, QTLs were identified with confidence intervals having overlapped physical coordinates in both the populations on chromosome 6, which was closely located to the GWAS-identified variants on chromosome 6. It makes this genomic region a crucial one to further investigate the possibility of developing trait markers for deployment in breeding pipelines. It was noted that previously reported QTLs for other stalk rots in maize mapped within the same physical intervals of several haplotypes identified for FSR resistance in this study. The possibility of QTLs controlling broad-spectrum resistance for PFSR in general requires further investigation. 
Key message: A key genomic region was identified for resistance to FSR at 168 Mb on chromosome 6 in GWAS and haplotype regression analysis, which was validated by QTL mapping in two populations."
36273546,response to heavy metals,ZmbZIP54 and ZmFDX5 cooperatively regulate maize seedling tolerance to lead by mediating ZmPRP1 transcription,"Extensive lead (Pb) accumulation in plants exerts toxic effects on plant growth and development and enters the human food chain. Combining linkage mapping, transcriptome analysis, and association studies, we cloned the ZmbZIP54 transcription factor, which confers maize tolerance to Pb. Combined overexpression and knockdown confirmed that ZmbZIP54 mitigates Pb toxicity in maize by alleviating Pb absorption into the roots. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays revealed that ZmbZIP54 binds to the ZmPRP1 promoter and promotes its transcription. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated that ZmFdx5 interacts with ZmbZIP54 in the nucleus. ZmFdx5 acts as a switch that controls the regulation of ZmPRP1 expression by ZmbZIP54 when maize encounters Pb stress. Furthermore, we revealed that variation in the 5'-UTR of ZmbZIP54 affects its expression level under Pb stress and contributes to the difference in Pb tolerance among maize lines. Finally, we proposed a model to summarize the role of ZmbZIP54 in Pb tolerance, which involves the cooperative effect of ZmbZIP54 and ZmFdx5 on the ZmPRP1 transcription in maize response to Pb. This study provides novel insights into the development of Pb-tolerant maize varieties and bioremediation of Pb-contaminated soils."
36275532,leaf angle,Morphological characterization and transcriptome analysis of leaf angle mutant bhlh112 in maize [Zea mays L.],"Leaf angle is an important agronomic trait in maize [Zea mays L.]. The compact plant phenotype, with a smaller leaf angle, is suited for high-density planting and thus for increasing crop yields. Here, we studied the ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced mutant bhlh112. Leaf angle and plant height were significantly decreased in bhlh112 compared to the wild-type plants. After treatment of seedlings with exogenous IAA and ABA respectively, under the optimal concentration of exogenous hormones, the variation of leaf angle of the mutant was more obvious than that of the wild-type, which indicated that the mutant was more sensitive to exogenous hormones. Transcriptome analysis showed that the ZmbHLH112 gene was related to the biosynthesis of auxin and brassinosteroids, and involved in the activation of genes related to the auxin and brassinosteroid signal pathways as well as cell elongation. Among the GO enrichment terms, we found many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in the cell membrane and ribosomal biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, and flavonoid biosynthesis, which could influence cell growth and the level of endogenous hormones affecting leaf angle. Therefore, ZmbHLH112 might regulate leaf angle development through the auxin signaling and the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathways. 12 genes related to the development of leaf were screened by WGCNA; In GO enrichment and KEGG pathways, the genes were mainly enriched in rRNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, Structural constituent of ribosome; Arabidopsis ribosome RNA methyltransferase CMAL is involved in plant development, likely by modulating auxin derived signaling pathways; The free 60s ribosomes and polysomes in the functional defective mutant rice minute-like1 (rml1) were significantly reduced, resulting in plant phenotypic diminution, narrow leaves, and growth retardation; Hence, ribosomal subunits may play an important role in leaf development. These results provide a foundation for further elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the regulation of leaf angle in maize."
36305873,drought response,"ZmLBD5, a class-II LBD gene, negatively regulates drought tolerance by impairing abscisic acid synthesis","Lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors. Class-I LBD members have been widely demonstrated to play pivotal roles in organ development; however, knowledge on class-II members remains limited. Here, we report that ZmLBD5, a class-II LBD member, is involved in the regulation of maize growth and drought response by affecting gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis. ZmLBD5 is mainly involved in regulation of the TPS-KS-GA2ox gene module, which comprises key enzymatic genes upstream of GA and ABA biosynthesis. The insufficiency of ABA increases stomatal density and aperture in overexpressed plants, and causes the drought sensitive phenotype by promoting water transpiration. The increase of GA1 promoted seedling growth in overexpressed plants. Accordingly, the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lbd5 seedlings were dwarf but drought tolerant. Moreover, lbd5 has larger grain yield under drought stress and no penalty in well watered conditions than the wild type. On the whole, ZmLBD5 is a negative regulator in maize drought tolerance, and it is a potentially useful target for drought resistance breeding."
36316635,cytoplasmic male sterility,Developmentally regulated mitochondrial biogenesis and cell death competence in maize pollen,"Background: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited failure to produce functional pollen that most commonly results from expression of novel, chimeric mitochondrial genes. In Zea mays, cytoplasmic male sterility type S (CMS-S) is characterized by the collapse of immature, bi-cellular pollen. Molecular and cellular features of developing CMS-S and normal (N) cytoplasm pollen were compared to determine the role of mitochondria in these differing developmental fates. 
Results: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling revealed both chromatin and nuclear fragmentation in the collapsed CMS-S pollen, demonstrating a programmed cell death (PCD) event sharing morphological features with mitochondria-signaled apoptosis in animals. Maize plants expressing mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) demonstrated dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology and association with actin filaments through the course of N-cytoplasm pollen development, whereas mitochondrial targeting of GFP was lost and actin filaments were disorganized in developing CMS-S pollen. Immunoblotting revealed significant developmental regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in both CMS-S and N mito-types. Nuclear and mitochondrial genome encoded components of the cytochrome respiratory pathway and ATP synthase were of low abundance at the microspore stage, but microspores accumulated abundant nuclear-encoded alternative oxidase (AOX). Cytochrome pathway and ATP synthase components accumulated whereas AOX levels declined during the maturation of N bi-cellular pollen. Increased abundance of cytochrome pathway components and declining AOX also characterized collapsed CMS-S pollen. The accumulation and robust RNA editing of mitochondrial transcripts implicated translational or post-translational control for the developmentally regulated accumulation of mitochondria-encoded proteins in both mito-types. 
Conclusions: CMS-S pollen collapse is a PCD event coincident with developmentally programmed mitochondrial events including the accumulation of mitochondrial respiratory proteins and declining protection against mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species."
36319608,response to Gibberella stalk rot,ZmEREB92 interacts with ZmMYC2 to activate maize terpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis upon Fusarium graminearum infection through Jasmonic acid/Ethylene signaling,"Maize (Zea mays) terpenoid phytoalexins (MTPs) induced by multiple fungus display extensive antimicrobial activities, yet how maize precisely regulates MTP accumulation upon pathogen infection remains elusive. In this study, pretreatment with Jasmonic acid (JA)/Ethylene (ET)-related inhibitors significantly reduces Fusarium graminearum-induced MTP accumulation and results in enhance susceptibility to F. graminearum, indicating the involvement of JA/ET in MTP regulatory network. ZmEREB92 is identified to positively regulate MTP biosynthetic gene (MBG) expression by correlation analysis. Knockout of ZmEREB92 significantly compromises maize resistance to F. graminearum with delayed induction of MBGs and attenuated MTP accumulation. The activation of ZmEREB92 on MBGs is dependent on the interaction with ZmMYC2, which directly binds to MBG promoters. ZmJAZ14 interacts with both ZmEREB92 and ZmMYC2 in a competitive manner to negatively regulate MBG expression. Altogether, our findings illustrate the regulatory mechanism for JA/ET-mediated MTP accumulation upon F. graminearum infection with involvement of ZmEREB92, ZmMYC2 and ZmJAZ14, which provides new insights into maize disease responses."
36319954,stalk lodging,Identification of quantitative trait loci for related traits of stalk lodging resistance using genome-wide association studies in maize (Zea mays L.),"Background: Stalk lodging is one of the main factors affecting maize (Zea mays L.) yield and limiting mechanized harvesting. Developing maize varieties with high stalk lodging resistance requires exploring the genetic basis of lodging resistance-associated agronomic traits. Stalk strength is an important indicator to evaluate maize lodging and can be evaluated by measuring stalk rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) and stalk buckling strength (SBS). Along with morphological traits of the stalk for the third internodes length (TIL), fourth internode length (FIL), third internode diameter (TID), and the fourth internode diameter (FID) traits are associated with stalk lodging resistance. 
Results: In this study, a natural population containing 248 diverse maize inbred lines genotyped with 83,057 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) for six stalk lodging resistance-related traits. The heritability of all traits ranged from 0.59 to 0.72 in the association mapping panel. A total of 85 significant SNPs were identified for the association mapping panel using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values of all traits. Additionally, five candidate genes were associated with stalk strength traits, which were either directly or indirectly associated with cell wall components. 
Conclusions: These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of maize stalk lodging and provide valuable theoretical guidance for lodging resistance in maize breeding in the future."
36321716,tocochromanol content,Leveraging prior biological knowledge improves prediction of tocochromanols in maize grain,"With an essential role in human health, tocochromanols are mostly obtained by consuming seed oils; however, the vitamin E content of the most abundant tocochromanols in maize (Zea mays L.) grain is low. Several large-effect genes with cis-acting variants affecting messenger RNA (mRNA) expression are mostly responsible for tocochromanol variation in maize grain, with other relevant associated quantitative trait loci (QTL) yet to be fully resolved. Leveraging existing genomic and transcriptomic information for maize inbreds could improve prediction when selecting for higher vitamin E content. Here, we first evaluated a multikernel genomic best linear unbiased prediction (MK-GBLUP) approach for modeling known QTL in the prediction of nine tocochromanol grain phenotypes (12-21 QTL per trait) within and between two panels of 1,462 and 242 maize inbred lines. On average, MK-GBLUP models improved predictive abilities by 7.0-13.6% when compared with GBLUP. In a second approach with a subset of 545 lines from the larger panel, the highest average improvement in predictive ability relative to GBLUP was achieved with a multi-trait GBLUP model (15.4%) that had a tocochromanol phenotype and transcript abundances in developing grain for a few large-effect candidate causal genes (1-3 genes per trait) as multiple response variables. Taken together, our study illustrates the enhancement of prediction models when informed by existing biological knowledge pertaining to QTL and candidate causal genes."
36345007,response to heat stress,Mapping responsive genomic elements to heat stress in a maize diversity panel,"Background: Many plant species exhibit genetic variation for coping with environmental stress. However, there are still limited approaches to effectively uncover the genomic region that regulates distinct responsive patterns of the gene across multiple varieties within the same species under abiotic stress. 
Results: By analyzing the transcriptomes of more than 100 maize inbreds, we reveal many cis- and trans-acting eQTLs that influence the expression response to heat stress. The cis-acting eQTLs in response to heat stress are identified in genes with differential responses to heat stress between genotypes as well as genes that are only expressed under heat stress. The cis-acting variants for heat stress-responsive expression likely result from distinct promoter activities, and the differential heat responses of the alleles are confirmed for selected genes using transient expression assays. Global footprinting of transcription factor binding is performed in control and heat stress conditions to document regions with heat-enriched transcription factor binding occupancies. 
Conclusions: Footprints enriched near proximal regions of characterized heat-responsive genes in a large association panel can be utilized for prioritizing functional genomic regions that regulate genotype-specific responses under heat stress."
36345780,drought response,Comparative Transcriptomic Reveals the Molecular Mechanism of Maize Hybrid Zhengdan538 in Response to Water Deficit,"Heterosis, known as one of the most successful strategies for increasing grain yield and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance, has been widely exploited in maize breeding. However, the underlying molecular processes are still to be elucidated. The maize hybrid 'Zhengdan538NULL shows high tolerance to drought stress. The transcriptomes of the seedling leaves of its parents, 'ZhengA88NULL and 'ZhengT22NULL and their reciprocal F1 hybrid under well-watered and water deficit conditions, were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Transcriptome profiling of the reciprocal hybrid revealed 2994 - 4692 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under well-watered and water deficit conditions, which were identified by comparing with their parents. The reciprocal hybrid was more closely related to the parental line 'ZhengT22NULL than to the parental line 'ZhengA88NULL in terms of gene expression patterns under water deficit condition. Furthermore, genes showed expression level dominance (ELD), especially the high-parental ELD (Class 3 and 5), accounted for the largest proportion of DEGs between the reciprocal F1 hybrid and their parental lines under water deficit. These ELD genes mainly participated in photosynthesis, energy biosynthesis and metabolism processes. The results indicated that ELD genes played important roles in hybrid tolerance to water deficit. Moreover, a set of important drought-responsive transcription factors were found to be encoded by the identified ELD genes and are thought to function in improving drought tolerance in maize hybrid plants. Our results provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in hybrid maize."
36349965,insect response,ZmMYC2s play important roles in maize responses to simulated herbivory and jasmonate,"Both herbivory and jasmonic acid (JA) activate the biosynthesis of defensive metabolites in maize, but the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. We generated maize mutants in which ZmMYC2a and ZmMYC2b, two transcription factor genes important in JA signaling, were individually or both knocked out. Genetic and biochemical analyses were used to elucidate the functions of ZmMYC2 proteins in the maize response to simulated herbivory and JA. Compared with the wild-type (WT) maize, the double mutant myc2ab was highly susceptible to insects, and the levels of benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenes, and the levels of their biosynthesis gene transcripts, were much lower in the mutants than in the WT maize after simulated insect feeding or JA treatment. Moreover, ZmMYC2a and ZmMYC2b played a redundant role in maize resistance to insects and JA signaling. Transcriptome and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation-Sequencing (CUT&Tag-Seq) analysis indicated that ZmMYC2s physically targeted 60% of the JA-responsive genes, even though only 33% of these genes were transcriptionally ZmMYC2-dependent. Importantly, CUT&Tag-Seq and dual luciferase assays revealed that ZmMYC2s transactivate the benzoxazinoid and volatile terpene biosynthesis genes IGPS1/3, BX10/11/12/14, and TPS10/2/3/4/5/8 by directly binding to their promoters. Furthermore, several transcription factors physically targeted by ZmMYC2s were identified, and these are likely to function in the regulation of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. This work reveals the transcriptional regulatory landscapes of both JA signaling and ZmMYC2s in maize and provides comprehensive mechanistic insight into how JA signaling modulates defenses in maize responses to herbivory through ZmMYC2s."
36350935,phosphorus use efficiency,Expression analysis of phosphate induced genes in contrasting maize genotypes for phosphorus use efficiency,"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. The ability of plants to acquire phosphate (Pi) from the rhizosphere soil is critical in the Brazilian Cerrado characterized by acidic soil. The induction of Pi transporters is one of the earliest molecular responses to Pi deficiency in plants. In this study, we characterize the transcriptional regulation of six (ZmPT1 to ZmPT6) high-affinity Pi transporters genes in four Pi-efficient and four Pi-inefficient maize (Zea mays) genotypes. The expression analysis indicated that Pi-starvation induced the transcription of all ZmPT genes tested. The abundance of transcripts was inversely related to Pi concentration in nutrient solution and was observed as early as five days following the Pi deprivation. The Pi-starved plants replenished with 250 µM Pi for four to five days resulted in ZmPT suppression, indicating the Pi role in gene expression. The tissue-specific expression analysis revealed the abundance of ZmPT transcripts in roots and shoots. The six maize Pi transporters were primarily detected in the upper and middle root portions and barely expressed in root tips. The expression profiles of the six ZmPTs phosphate transporters between and among Pi-efficient and Pi-inefficient genotypes showed an absence of significant differences in the expression pattern of the ZmPTs among Pi-efficient and Pi-inefficient genotypes. The results suggested that Pi acquisition efficiency is a complex trait determined by quantitative loci in maize."
36354146,drought response,Positional cloning and characterization reveal the role of a miRNA precursor gene ZmLRT in the regulation of lateral root number and drought tolerance in maize,"Lateral roots play essential roles in drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays L.). However, the genetic basis for the variation in the number of lateral roots in maize remains elusive. Here, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), qLRT5-1, controlling lateral root number using a recombinant inbred population from a cross between the maize lines Zong3 (with many lateral roots) and 87-1 (with few lateral roots). Fine-mapping and functional analysis determined that the candidate gene for qLRT5-1, ZmLRT, expresses the primary transcript for the microRNA miR166a. ZmLRT was highly expressed in root tips and lateral root primordia, and knockout and overexpression of ZmLRT increased and decreased lateral root number, respectively. Compared to 87-1, the ZmLRT gene model of Zong3 lacked the second and third exons and contained a 14 bp deletion at the junction between the first exon and intron, which altered the splicing site. In addition, ZmLRT expression was significantly lower in Zong3 than in 87-1, which might be attributed to the insertions of a transposon and over large DNA fragments in the Zong3 ZmLRT promoter region. These mutations decreased the abundance of mature miR166a in Zong3, resulting in increased lateral roots at the seedling stage. Furthermore, miR166a post-transcriptionally repressed five development-related class-III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes. Moreover, knockout of ZmLRT enhanced drought tolerance of maize seedlings. Our study furthers our understanding of the genetic basis of lateral root number variation in maize and highlights ZmLRT as a target for improving drought tolerance in maize."
36355988,response to Aspergillus flavus,Comparative Analysis of Multiple GWAS Results Identifies Metabolic Pathways Associated with Resistance to A. flavus Infection and Aflatoxin Accumulation in Maize,"Aflatoxins are carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by several species of Aspergillus, including Aspergillus flavus, an important ear rot pathogen in maize. Most commercial corn hybrids are susceptible to infection by A. flavus, and aflatoxin contaminated grain causes economic damage to farmers. The creation of inbred lines resistant to Aspergillus fungal infection or the accumulation of aflatoxins would be aided by knowing the pertinent alleles and metabolites associated with resistance in corn lines. Multiple Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and association mapping studies have uncovered several dozen potential genes, but each with a small effect on resistance. Metabolic pathway analysis, using the Pathway Association Study Tool (PAST), was performed on aflatoxin accumulation resistance using data from four Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). The present research compares the outputs of these pathway analyses and seeks common metabolic mechanisms underlying each. Genes, pathways, metabolites, and mechanisms highlighted here can contribute to improving phenotypic selection of resistant lines via measurement of more specific and highly heritable resistance-related traits and genetic gain via marker assisted or genomic selection with multiple SNPs linked to resistance-related pathways."
36383026,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,Genetic basis of resistance to southern corn leaf blight in the maize multi-parent population and diversity panel,"Southern corn leaf blight (SLB), caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, is one of maize foliar diseases and poses a great threat to corn production around the world. Identification of genetic variations underlying resistance to SLB is of paramount importance to maize yield and quality. Here, we used a Random-Open-parent Association Mapping (ROAM) population containing eight recombinant inbred line populations and one Association Mapping Panel (AMP) consisting of 513 diversity maize inbred lines with high-density genetic markers to dissect the genetic basis of SLB resistance. Overall, 109 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with predominantly small or moderate additive effects, and little epistatic effects were identified. We found 35 (32.1%) novel loci in comparison with the reported QTLs. We revealed that resistant alleles were significantly enriched in tropical accessions and the frequency of about half of resistant alleles decreased during the adaptation process owing to the selection of agronomic traits. A large number of annotated genes located in the SLB resistant QTLs were shown to be involved in plant defense pathways. Integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS), transcriptomic profiling, resequencing and gene editing, we identified ZmFUT1 and MYBR92 as the putative genes responsible for the major QTLs for resistance to C. heterostrophus. Our results present a comprehensive insight on the genetic basis of SLB resistance and provide resistant loci or genes as direct targets for crop genetic improvement."
36385527,"protein content, kernel; nitrogen use efficiency",THP9 enhances seed protein content and nitrogen-use efficiency in maize,"Teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize (Zea mays subsp. mays), has three times the seed protein content of most modern inbreds and hybrids, but the mechanisms that are responsible for this trait are unknown1,2. Here we use trio binning to create a contiguous haplotype DNA sequence of a teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) and, through map-based cloning, identify a major high-protein quantitative trait locus, TEOSINTE HIGH PROTEIN 9 (THP9), on chromosome 9. THP9 encodes an asparagine synthetase 4 enzyme that is highly expressed in teosinte, but not in the B73 inbred, in which a deletion in the tenth intron of THP9-B73 causes incorrect splicing of THP9-B73 transcripts. Transgenic expression of THP9-teosinte in B73 significantly increased the seed protein content. Introgression of THP9-teosinte into modern maize inbreds and hybrids greatly enhanced the accumulation of free amino acids, especially asparagine, throughout the plant, and increased seed protein content without affecting yield. THP9-teosinte seems to increase nitrogen-use efficiency, which is important for promoting a high yield under low-nitrogen conditions."
36388478,response to salt; primary lateral root length ,Natural variation and domestication selection of ZmSULTR3;4 is associated with maize lateral root length in response to salt stress,"Soil salinity is a major constraint that restricts crop productivity worldwide. Lateral roots (LRs) are important for water and nutrient acquisition, therefore understanding the genetic basis of natural variation in lateral root length (LRL) is of great agronomic relevance to improve salt tolerance in cultivated germplasms. Here, using a genome-wide association study, we showed that the genetic variation in ZmSULTR3;4, which encodes a plasma membrane-localized sulfate transporter, is associated with natural variation in maize LRL under salt stress. The transcript of ZmSULTR3;4 was found preferentially in the epidermal and vascular tissues of root and increased by salt stress, supporting its essential role in the LR formation under salt stress. Further candidate gene association analysis showed that DNA polymorphisms in the promoter region differentiate the expression of ZmSULTR3;4 among maize inbred lines that may contribute to the natural variation of LRL under salt stress. Nucleotide diversity and neutrality tests revealed that ZmSULTR3;4 has undergone selection during maize domestication and improvement. Overall, our results revealed a regulatory role of ZmSULTR3;4 in salt regulated LR growth and uncovered favorable alleles of ZmSULTR3;4, providing an important selection target for breeding salt-tolerant maize cultivar."
36388551,response to Fusarium ear rot; response to Gibberella ear rot,Meta-analysis and co-expression analysis revealed stable QTL and candidate genes conferring resistances to Fusarium and Gibberella ear rots while reducing mycotoxin contamination in maize,"Fusarium (FER) and Gibberella ear rots (GER) are the two most devastating diseases of maize (Zea mays L.) which reduce yield and affect grain quality worldwide, especially by contamination with mycotoxins. Genetic improvement of host resistance to effectively tackle FER and GER diseases requires the identification of stable quantitative trait loci (QTL) to facilitate the application of genomics-assisted breeding for improving selection efficiency in breeding programs. We applied improved meta-analysis algorithms to re-analyze 224 QTL identified in 15 studies based on dense genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in order to identify meta-QTL (MQTL) and colocalized genomic loci for fumonisin (FUM) and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation, silk (SR) and kernel (KR) resistances of both FER and GER, kernel dry-down rate (KDD) and husk coverage (HC). A high-resolution genetic consensus map with 36,243 loci was constructed and enabled the projection of 164 of the 224 collected QTL. Candidate genes (CG) mining was performed within the most refined MQTL, and identified CG were cross-validated using publicly available transcriptomic data of maize under Fusarium graminearum infection. The meta-analysis revealed 40 MQTL, of which 29 were associated each with 2-5 FER- and/or GER-related traits. Twenty-eight of the 40 MQTL were common to both FER and GER resistances and 19 MQTL were common to silk and kernel resistances. Fourteen most refined MQTL on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 harbored a total of 2,272 CG. Cross-validation identified 59 of these CG as responsive to FER and/or GER diseases. MQTL ZmMQTL2.2, ZmMQTL9.2 and ZmMQTL9.4 harbored promising resistance genes, of which GRMZM2G011151 and GRMZM2G093092 were specific to the resistant line for both diseases and encoded ""terpene synthase21 (tps21)"" and ""flavonoid O-methyltransferase2 (fomt2)"", respectively. Our findings revealed stable refined MQTL harboring promising candidate genes for use in breeding programs for improving FER and GER resistances with reduced mycotoxin accumulation. These candidate genes can be transferred into elite cultivars by integrating refined MQTL into genomics-assisted backcross breeding strategies."
36396706,root morphology,Genome-wide dissection of changes in maize root system architecture during modern breeding,"Appropriate root system architecture (RSA) can improve maize yields in densely planted fields, but little is known about its genetic basis in maize. Here we performed root phenotyping of 14,301 field-grown plants from an association mapping panel to study the genetic architecture of maize RSA. A genome-wide association study identified 81 high-confidence RSA-associated candidate genes and revealed that 28 (24.3%) of known root-related genes were selected during maize domestication and improvement. We found that modern maize breeding has selected for a steeply angled root system. Favourable alleles related to steep root system angle have continuously accumulated over the course of modern breeding, and our data pinpoint the root-related genes that have been selected in different breeding eras. We confirm that two auxin-related genes, ZmRSA3.1 and ZmRSA3.2, contribute to the regulation of root angle and depth in maize. Our genome-wide identification of RSA-associated genes provides new strategies and genetic resources for breeding maize suitable for high-density planting."
36397013,ear morphology,Genome-wide association studies revealed complex genetic architecture and breeding perspective of maize ear traits,"Background: Maize (Zea Mays) is one of the world's most important crops. Hybrid maize lines resulted a major improvement in corn production in the previous and current centuries. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of the corn production associated traits greatly facilitate the development of superior hybrid varieties. 

Result: In this study, four ear traits associated with corn production of Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population were analyzed using a full genetic model, and further, optimal genotype combinations and total genetic effects of current best lines, superior lines, and superior hybrids were predicted for each of the traits at four different locations. The analysis identified 21-34 highly significant SNPs (-log10P > 5), with an estimated total heritability of 37.31-62.34%, while large contributions to variations was due to dominance, dominance-related epistasis, and environmental interaction effects ([Formula: see text] 14.06% ~ 49.28%), indicating these factors contributed significantly to phenotypic variations of the ear traits. Environment-specific genetic effects were also discovered to be crucial for maize ear traits. There were four SNPs found for three ear traits: two for ear length and weight, and two for ear row number and length. Using the Enumeration method and the stepwise tuning technique, optimum multi-locus genotype combinations for superior lines were identified based on the information obtained from GWAS. 

Conclusions: Predictions of genetic breeding values showed that different genotype combinations in different geographical regions may be better, and hybrid-line variety breeding with homozygote and heterozygote genotype combinations may have a greater potential to improve ear traits."
36404129,leaf development,Hormonal control of medial‐lateral growth and vein formation in the maize leaf,"Parallel veins are characteristic of monocots, including grasses (Poaceae). Therefore, how parallel veins develop as the leaf grows in the medial-lateral (ML) dimension is a key question in grass leaf development. Using fluorescent protein reporters, we mapped auxin, cytokinin (CK), and gibberellic acid (GA) response patterns in maize (Zea mays) leaf primordia. We further defined the roles of these hormones in ML growth and vein formation through combinatorial genetic analyses and measurement of hormone concentrations. We discovered a novel pattern of auxin response in the adaxial protoderm that we hypothesize has important implications for the orderly formation of 3° veins early in leaf development. In addition, we found an auxin transport and response pattern in the margins that correlates with the transition from ML to PD growth. We present evidence that auxin efflux precedes CK response in procambial strand development. We also determined that GA plays an early role in the shoot apical meristem as well as a later role in the primordium to restrict ML growth. We propose an integrative model whereby auxin regulates ML growth and vein formation in the maize leaf through control of GA and CK."
36404928,cadmium content,Integration of Transcriptome and Metabolome Analyses Reveals the Mechanistic Basis for Cadmium Accumulation in Maize,"Cadmium (Cd) pollution in soil has become a major environmental issue worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of low grain-Cd accumulation (GCA) in maize is still largely unknown. Herein, we report the mechanistic basis for low GCA in maize by a multiomics approach. The low GCA genotype L63 showed normal vacuolar formation and a lower capacity of xylem loading of Cd than the high-accumulator L42 under Cd stress. Transcriptomic sequencing identified 84 low-GCA-associated genes which are mainly involved in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, metal transport, and vacuolar sequestration. A metabolome analysis revealed that L63 plants had a more active SAM cycle and a greater capacity for terpenoid synthesis and phenylalanine metabolism than L42. Combining the analysis of transcriptome and metabolome characterized several genes as key genes involved in the determination of Cd accumulation. Our study identifies a mechanistic basis for low Cd accumulation in maize grains and provides candidate genes for genetic improvement of crops."
36420031,response to heat stress,Key role of reactive oxygen species-scavenging system in nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide crosstalk-evoked thermotolerance in maize seedlings.,"Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are novel signaling molecules, which participate in plant growth, development, and response to stress. In this study root-irrigation with 0.15 mM sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor) up-regulated gene expression of L-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE1 (LCD1), activities of L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) and D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD), as well as an endogenous H2S level, compared to control seedlings. The SNP-up-regulated effects were enhanced by 0.5 mM sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, H2S donor), but weakened by NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) and H2S scavenger hypotaurine (HT) alone. NaHS had no significant effect on gene expression and activity of nitrate reductase (NR, a NO candidate producing enzyme). These data indicate that NO could trigger the LCD/H2S signaling pathway in maize seedlings. To further investigate the effect of NO and H2S crosstalk on thermotolerance in maize seedlings, thermotolerance parameters and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system were estimated. The results show that SNP increased survival rate and tissue viability, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation, and electrolyte leakage in maize seedlings under heat stress (HS), implying NO could improve thermotolerance in maize seedlings. The NO-improved thermotolerance was impaired by H2S inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PAG) and scavenger HT alone. Similarly, SNP up-regulated the gene expression of DEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (DHAR) and GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE1 (GR1); activities of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase; as well as levels of ascorbic acid, glutathione, flavonoids, carotenoids, and total phenols. SNP also reduced hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical accumulation in maize seedlings under HS compared to the control. The effects of SNP on ROS and their scavenger system were weakened by PAG and HT alone. These data hint that NO could evoke thermotolerance in maize seedlings by triggering the LCD/H2S signaling pathway, and the ROS-scavenging system played a key role in the NO and H2S crosstalk-evoked thermotolerance."
36430424,phosphorus use efficiency,Genetic Dissection of Phosphorus Use Efficiency and Genotype-by-Environment Interaction in Maize.,"Genotype-by-environment interaction (G-by-E) is a common but potentially problematic phenomenon in plant breeding. In this study, we investigated the genotypic performance and two measures of plasticity on a phenotypic and genetic level by assessing 234 maize doubled haploid lines from six populations for 15 traits in seven macro-environments with a focus on varying soil phosphorus levels. It was found intergenic regions contributed the most to the variation of phenotypic linear plasticity. For 15 traits, 124 and 31 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for genotypic performance and phenotypic plasticity, respectively. Further, some genes associated with phosphorus use efficiency, such as Zm00001eb117170, Zm00001eb258520, and Zm00001eb265410, encode small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase were identified. By significantly testing the main effect and G-by-E effect, 38 main QTL and 17 interaction QTL were identified, respectively, in which MQTL38 contained the gene Zm00001eb374120, and its effect was related to phosphorus concentration in the soil, the lower the concentration, the greater the effect. Differences in the size and sign of the QTL effect in multiple environments could account for G-by-E. At last, the superiority of G-by-E in genomic selection was observed. In summary, our findings will provide theoretical guidance for breeding P-efficient and broadly adaptable varieties."
36437932,leaf angle,Candidate loci for leaf angle in maize revealed by a combination of genome-wide association study and meta-analysis.,"Leaf angle (LA) is a key component of maize plant architecture that can simultaneously govern planting density and improve final yield. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying LA have not been fully addressed. To broaden our understanding of its genetic basis, we scored three LA-related traits on upper, middle, and low leaves of 492 maize inbred lines in five environments. Phenotypic data revealed that the three LA-related traits were normally distributed, and significant variation was observed among environments and genotypes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then performed to dissect the genetic factors that control natural variation in maize LA. In total, 85 significant SNPs (involving 32 non-redundant QTLs) were detected (p ≤ 2.04 × 10-6), and individual QTL explained 4.80%-24.09% of the phenotypic variation. Five co-located QTL were detected in at least two environments, and two QTLs were co-located with multiple LA-related traits. Forty-seven meta-QTLs were identified based on meta-analysis combing 294 LA-related QTLs extracted from 18 previously published studies, 816 genes were identified within these meta-QTLs, and seven co-located QTLs were jointly identified by both GWAS and meta-analysis. ZmULA1 was located in one of the co-located QTLs, qLA7, and its haplotypes, hap1 and hap2, differed significantly in LA-related traits. Interestingly, the temperate materials with hap2 had smallest LA. Finally, we also performed haplotype analysis using the reported genes that regulate LA, and identified a lot of maize germplasms that aggregated favorable haplotypes. These results will be helpful for elucidating the genetic basis of LA and breeding new maize varieties with ideal plant architecture."
36447436,plant height,"Integrating high-throughput phenotyping, GWAS and prediction models reveals the genetic architecture of plant height in maize.","Plant height (PH) is an essential trait in maize (Zea mays L.) which is tightly associated with planting density, biomass, lodging resistance and grain yield in the field. Dissecting the dynamics of maize plant architecture will be beneficial for ideotype-based maize breeding and prediction, as the genetic basis controlling PH in maize remains largely unknown. Here, we developed an automated high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTP) to systematically and noninvasively quantify 77 image-based traits (i-traits) and 20 field traits (f-traits) for 228 maize inbred lines across all developmental stages. Time-resolved i-traits with novel digital phenotypes and complex correlations with agronomic traits were characterized to reveal the dynamics of maize growth. An i-trait-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 4945 trait-associated SNPs, 2603 genetic loci, and 1974 corresponding candidate genes. Interestingly, we found that rapid growth of maize plants mainly occurs at two developmental stages, Stage 2 (S2) to S3 and S5 to S6, accounting for the final PH indicators. By integrating the plant height-association network with the transcriptome profiles of specific internodes, we revealed 13 hub genes that might play vital roles during the rapid growth. The candidate genes and novel i-traits identified at multiple growth stages might be used as potential indicators for final PH in maize. The function of one candidate gene, ZmVATE, was validated to regulate plant height-related traits in maize by using genetic mutation. Furthermore, we used machine learning to build prediction models for final plant height based on i-traits, and predictive performance was assessed in validation across developmental stages. Moderate, strong, and very strong correlations between prediction and experimental datasets were achieved from early S4 (tenth-leaf) stage. Overall, our study provided a valuable tool for dissecting the spatiotemporal formation of specific internodes and the genetic architecture of PH, as well as resources and prediction models that are useful for molecular design breeding and predicting maize varieties with ideal plant architectures."
36448658,disease response,Quantitative disease resistance: Multifaceted players in plant defense.,"In contrast to large-effect qualitative disease resistance, quantitative disease resistance (QDR) exhibits partial and generally durable resistance and has been extensively utilized in crop breeding. The molecular mechanisms underlying QDR remain largely unknown but considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years. In this review, we summarize the genes that have been associated with plant QDR and their biological functions. Many QDR genes belong to the canonical resistance gene categories with predicted functions in pathogen perception, signal transduction, phytohormone homeostasis, primary and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and epigenetic regulation. However, other ""atypical"" QDR genes are predicted to be involved in processes that are not commonly associated with disease resistance, such as vesicle trafficking, molecular chaperones, and others. This diversity of function for QDR genes contrasts with qualitative resistance which is often based on the actions of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) resistance proteins. An understanding of the diversity of QDR mechanisms and of which mechanisms are effective against which classes of pathogens will enable the more effective deployment of QDR to produce more durably resistant, resilient crops."
36461635,"protein content, kernel",Improving maize seed protein content and nitrogen-use efficiency by a teosinte asparagine synthetase.,"In summary, the work by Huang et al. not only makes a breakthrough in dissecting genetic basis toward seed protein content between teosinte and maize, but also uncovers an unexpected solution for NUE improvement that brought by an ancient allele. The speculation that THP9-T allele is neglected during maize domestication reminds us of a similar pattern that the ancient allele of OsTCP19 undergone in rice, which was largely lost in modern rice cultivars due to the overloading of nitrogen fertilizer (Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, retracing more beneficial alleles from wild relatives would be inspiring strategy for improving future crop breeding regarding to both food and feed in a more sustainable manner."
36472157,inflorescence development,UB2/UB3/TSH4-anchored transcriptional networks regulate early maize inflorescence development in response to simulated shade.,"Increasing planting density has been adopted as an effective means to increase maize (Zea mays) yield. Competition for light from neighbors can trigger plant shade avoidance syndrome, which includes accelerated flowering. However, the regulatory networks of maize inflorescence development in response to high-density planting remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that shade-mimicking treatments cause precocious development of the tassels and ears. Comparative transcriptome profiling analyses revealed enrichment of phytohormone-related genes and transcriptional regulators among the genes co-regulated by developmental progression and simulated shade. Network analysis showed that three homologous Squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP)-like (SPL) transcription factors, Unbranched2 (UB2), Unbranched3 (UB3) and Tasselsheath4 (TSH4), individually exhibited connectivity to over 2,400 genes across the V3-to-V9 stages of tassel development. In addition, we showed that the ub2 ub3 double mutant and tsh4 single mutant were almost insensitive to simulated shade treatments. Moreover, we demonstrated that UB2/UB3/TSH4 could directly regulate the expression of Barren inflorescence2 (BIF2) and Zea mays teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor30 (ZmTCP30). Further, we functionally verified a role of ZmTCP30 in regulating tassel branching and ear development. Our results reveal a UB2/UB3/TSH4-anchored transcriptional regulatory network of maize inflorescence development and provide valuable targets for breeding shade-tolerant maize cultivars."
36501283,response to cold stress,Genomic Characteristics of Elite Maize Inbred Line 18-599 and Its Transcriptional Response to Drought and Low-Temperature Stresses.,"Elite inbred line 18-599 was developed via triple test cross from introduced hybrid P78599 and used as parents of dozens of maize hybrids adapting to the diverse ecological conditions of the maize ecological region in Southwest China. In this study, its genomic DNA was resequenced and aligned with the B73 genome sequence to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and insertion (In) and deletion (Del) loci. These loci were aligned with those between B73 and 1020 inbred lines in the HapMap database to identify specific variation loci of 18-599. The results showed that there were 930,439 specific SNPs and 358,750 InDels between 18-599 and the 1020 lines. In total, 21,961 of them showed significant impacts on the functions of 12,297 genes, such as frameshift, change of splicing site, stop gain, change of start site, and stop loss. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 18-599 was closely related to inbred lines ZEAxujRAUDIAAPE and 2005-4, but far from some inbred lines directly isolated from P78599. This result indicated that 18-599 not only pyramided the elite genes of P78599, but also acquired genetic divergence during the repetitive backcrosses of triple test cross to confer its elite agronomic characteristics. Subsequently, the RNA of 18-599 was sequenced. The aligned 9713 and 37,528 of the 165,098 unigenes were screened and aligned with annotated transcripts of the B73 genome differentially expressed under drought and low-temperature stress, respectively, and their functions were involved in the responses to these stresses. The quantitative PCR results of fourteen random genes verified the RNA sequencing results. These findings suggest that the transcriptional responses of many resistance-related genes were an important mechanism for 18-599 to adapt to diverse ecological conditions."
36506330,response to Exserohilum turcicum,SNP-based bulk segregant analysis revealed disease resistance QTLs associated with northern corn leaf blight in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important food security crop worldwide. Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), caused by Exserohilum turcicum, severely reduces production causing millions of dollars in losses worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to identify significant QTLs associated with NCLB by utilizing next-generation sequencing-based bulked-segregant analysis (BSA). Parental lines GML71 (resistant) and Gui A10341 (susceptible) were used to develop segregating population F2. Two bulks with 30 plants each were further selected from the segregating population for sequencing along with the parental lines. High throughput sequencing data was used for BSA. We identified 10 QTLs on Chr 1, Chr 2, Chr 3, and Chr 5 with 265 non-synonymous SNPs. Moreover, based on annotation information, we identified 27 candidate genes in the QTL regions. The candidate genes associated with disease resistance include AATP1, At4g24790, STICHEL-like 2, BI O 3-BIO1, ZAR1, SECA2, ABCG25, LECRK54, MKK7, MKK9, RLK902, and DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The annotation information suggested their involvement in disease resistance-related pathways, including protein phosphorylation, cytoplasmic vesicle, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and ATP binding pathways. Our study provides a substantial addition to the available information regarding QTLs associated with NCLB, and further functional verification of identified candidate genes can broaden the scope of understanding the NCLB resistance mechanism in maize."
36508348,inflorescence development,Interspecies transfer of RAMOSA1 orthologs and promoter cis sequences impacts maize inflorescence architecture.,"Grass inflorescences support floral structures that each bear a single grain, where variation in branch architecture directly impacts yield. The maize (Zea mays) RAMOSA1 (ZmRA1) transcription factor acts as a key regulator of inflorescence development by imposing branch meristem determinacy. Here, we show RA1 transcripts accumulate in boundary domains adjacent to spikelet meristems in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, Sb) and green millet (Setaria viridis, Sv) inflorescences similar as in the developing maize tassel and ear. To evaluate functional conservation of syntenic RA1 orthologs and promoter cis sequences in maize, sorghum and setaria, we utilized interspecies gene transfer and assayed genetic complementation in a common inbred background by quantifying recovery of normal branching in highly ramified ra1-R mutants. A ZmRA1 transgene that includes endogenous upstream and downstream flanking sequences recovered normal tassel and ear branching in ra1-R. Interspecies expression of two transgene variants of the SbRA1 locus, modeled as the entire endogenous tandem duplication or just the non-frameshifted downstream copy, complemented ra1-R branching defects and induced unusual fasciation and branch patterns. The SvRA1 locus lacks conserved, upstream noncoding cis sequences found in maize and sorghum; interspecies expression of an SvRA1 transgene did not or only partially recovered normal inflorescence forms. Driving expression of the SvRA1 coding region by the ZmRA1 upstream region, however, recovered normal inflorescence morphology in ra1-R. These data leveraging interspecies gene transfer suggest that cis-encoded temporal regulation of RA1 expression is a key factor in modulating branch meristem determinacy that ultimately impacts grass inflorescence architecture."
36523626,agrobacterium mediated transformation,Commercial scale genetic transformation of mature seed embryo explants in maize.,"A novel, efficient maize genetic transformation system was developed using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of embryo explants from mature seeds. Seeds from field grown plants were sterilized and crushed to isolate embryo explants consisting of the coleoptile, leaf primordia, and shoot apical meristem which were then purified from the ground seed bulk preparation. The infection of relevant tissues of seed embryo explants (SEEs) by Agrobacterium was improved by the centrifugation of the explants. Transgenic plants were obtained by multiple bud induction on high cytokinin media, followed by plant regeneration on hormone-free medium. Three different selectable markers (cp4 epsps, aadA, and nptII) were successfully used for producing transgenic plants. Stable integration of transgenes in the maize genome was demonstrated by molecular analyses and germline transmission of the inserted transgenes to the next generation was confirmed by pollen segregation and progeny analysis. Phenotypic evidence for chimeric transgenic tissue was frequently observed in initial experiments but was significantly reduced by including a second bud induction step with optimized cytokinin concentration. Additional improvements, including culturing explants at an elevated temperature during bud induction led to the development of a revolutionary system for efficient transgenic plant production and genome editing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful transgenic plant regeneration through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize mature SEEs. This system starts with mature seed that can be produced in large volumes and the SEEs explants are storable. It has significant advantages in terms of scalability and flexibility over methods that rely on immature explants."
36529716,"starch content, kernel; tassel branch number",Co-expression pan-network reveals genes involved in complex traits within maize pan-genome.,"With the advances in the high throughput next generation sequencing technologies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large set of variants associated with complex phenotypic traits at a very fine scale. Despite the progress in GWAS, identification of genotype-phenotype relationship remains challenging in maize due to its nature with dozens of variants controlling the same trait. As the causal variations results in the change in expression, gene expression analyses carry a pivotal role in unraveling the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms behind the phenotypes. To address these challenges, we incorporated the gene expression and GWAS-driven traits to extend the knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms behind the phenotypes. We constructed a large collection of gene co-expression networks and identified more than 2 million co-expressing gene pairs in the GWAS-driven pan-network which contains all the gene-pairs in individual genomes of the nested association mapping (NAM) population. We defined four sub-categories for the pan-network: (1) core-network contains the highest represented ~ 1% of the gene-pairs, (2) near-core network contains the next highest represented 1-5% of the gene-pairs, (3) private-network contains ~ 50% of the gene pairs that are unique to individual genomes, and (4) the dispensable-network contains the remaining 50-95% of the gene-pairs in the maize pan-genome. Strikingly, the private-network contained almost all the genes in the pan-network but lacked half of the interactions. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the pan-, core-, and private- networks and compared the contributions of variants overlapping with genes and promoters to the GWAS-driven pan-network. Gene co-expression networks revealed meaningful information about groups of co-regulated genes that play a central role in regulatory processes. Pan-network approach enabled us to visualize the global view of the gene regulatory network for the studied system that could not be well inferred by the core-network alone."
36533711,disease response,Brown midrib mutant and genome-wide association analysis uncover lignin genes for disease resistance in maize.,"Brown midrib (BMR) maize (Zea mays L.) harbors mutations that result in lower lignin levels and higher feed digestibility, making it a desirable silage market class for ruminant nutrition. Northern leaf blight (NLB) epidemics in upstate New York highlighted the disease susceptibility of commercially grown BMR maize hybrids. We found the bm1, bm2, bm3, and bm4 mutants in a W64A genetic background to be more susceptible to foliar fungal (NLB, gray leaf spot [GLS], and anthracnose leaf blight [ALB]) and bacterial (Stewart's wilt) diseases. The bm1, bm2, and bm3 mutants showed enhanced susceptibility to anthracnose stalk rot (ASR), and the bm1 and bm3 mutants were more susceptible to Gibberella ear rot (GER). Colocalization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and correlations between stalk strength and disease traits in recombinant inbred line families suggest possible pleiotropies. The role of lignin in plant defense was explored using high-resolution, genome-wide association analysis for resistance to NLB in the Goodman diversity panel. Association analysis identified 100 single and clustered single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations for resistance to NLB but did not implicate natural functional variation at bm1-bm5. Strong associations implicated a suite of diverse candidate genes including lignin-related genes such as a β-glucosidase gene cluster, hct11, knox1, knox2, zim36, lbd35, CASP-like protein 8, and xat3. The candidate genes are targets for breeding quantitative resistance to NLB in maize for use in silage and nonsilage purposes."
36539632,Abiotic stress response,Auxin homeostasis in maize (Zea mays) is regulated via 1-O-indole-3-acetyl-myo-inositol synthesis at early stages of seedling development and under abiotic stress.,"Indole-3-acetyl-myo-inositol biosynthesis is regulated during maize seedling development and in response to drought and cold stress. The main purpose of this pathway is maintenance of auxin homeostasis. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conjugation to myo-inositol is a part of a mechanism controlling free auxin level in maize. In this work, we investigated changes in the indole-3-acetyl-myo-inositol (IAInos) biosynthesis pathway in 3-d- and 6-d-old maize seedlings and germinating seeds as well as in seedlings subjected to drought and cold stress to evaluate a role of this pathway in maize development and stress response. In germinating seeds, activity of the enzymes involved in IAInos biosynthesis remains unchanged between 3-d- and 6-d-old material but increases in coleoptiles and radicles of the seedlings. Under cold stress, in germinating seeds and in coleoptiles, activity of the enzymes decreases and increases, respectively; however, it does not entail changes in auxin level. In drought-exposed germinating maize seeds, totally diminished activities of IAInos synthesis pathway enzymes resulted in almost twofold increase of free IAA content. Similar increase of auxin level was observed in radicles of drought-subjected seedlings together with lack of catalytic activity of the first enzyme of the pathway. Exogenous IAInos has no effect on the level of non-enzymatic antioxidant, ascorbate. It has also either no effect on the protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation, or it affects it in a similar way as exogenously applied IAA and myo-inositol, which are products of IAInos hydrolysis. Thus, IAInos biosynthesis pathway acts in maize development and stress responses by regulation of free IAA concentration, as IAInos itself does not appear to have a distinct role in these processes."
36542628,Morphological,Morphological and genetic diversity of maize landraces along an altitudinal gradient in the Southern Andes.,"Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is a major cereal crop worldwide and is traditionally or commercially cultivated almost all over the Americas. The North-Western Argentina (NWA) region constitutes one of the main diversity hotspots of the Southern Andes, with contrasting landscapes and a large number of landraces. Despite the extensive collections performed by the ""Banco Activo de Germoplasma INTA Pergamino, Argentina"" (BAP), most of them have not been characterized yet. Here we report the morphological and molecular evaluation of 30 accessions collected from NWA, along an altitudinal gradient between 1120 and 2950 meters above sea level (masl). Assessment of morphological variation in a common garden allowed the discrimination of two groups, which differed mainly in endosperm type and overall plant size. Although the groups retrieved by the molecular analyses were not consistent with morphological clusters, they showed a clear pattern of altitudinal structuring. Affinities among accessions were not in accordance with racial assignments. Overall, our results revealed that there are two maize gene pools co-existing in NWA, probably resulting from various waves of maize introduction in pre-Columbian times as well as from the adoption of modern varieties by local farmers. In conclusion, the NWA maize landraces preserved at the BAP possess high morphological and molecular variability. Our results highlight their potential as a source of diversity for increasing the genetic basis of breeding programs and provide useful information to guide future sampling and conservation efforts."
36555363,response to salt,Genome-Wide Characterization and Function Analysis of ZmERD15 GenesNULL Response to Saline Stress in Zea mays L.,"Early responsive dehydration (ERD) genes can be rapidly induced by dehydration. ERD15 genes have been confirmed to regulate various stress responses in plants. However, the maize ERD15 members have not been characterized. In the present study, a total of five ZmERD15 genes were identified from the maize genome and named ZmERD15a, ZmERD15b, ZmERD15c, ZmERD15d, and ZmERD15e. Subsequently, their protein properties, gene structure and duplication, chromosomal location, cis-acting elements, subcellular localization, expression pattern, and over-expression in yeast were analyzed. The results showed that the ZmERD15 proteins were characterized by a similar size (113-159 aa) and contained a common domain structure, with PAM2 and adjacent PAE1 motifs followed by an acidic region. The ZmERD15 proteins exhibited a close phylogenetic relationship with OsERD15s from rice. Five ZmERD15 genes were distributed on maize chromosomes 2, 6, 7, and 9 and showed a different exon-intron organization and were expanded by duplication. Besides, the promoter region of the ZmERD15s contained abundant cis-acting elements that are known to be responsive to stress and hormones. Subcellular localization showed that ZmERD15b and ZmERD15c were localized in the nucleus. ZmERD15a and ZmERD15e were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. ZmERD15d was localized in the nucleus and cell membrane. The results of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of the ZmERD15 genes was regulated by PEG, salinity, and ABA. The heterologous expression of ZmERD15a, ZmERD15b, ZmERD15c, and ZmERD15d significantly enhanced salt tolerance in yeast. In summary, a comprehensive analysis of ZmERD15s was conducted in the study. The results will provide insights into further dissecting the biological function and molecular mechanism of ZmERD15s regulating of the stress response in maize."
36562877,response to western corn rootworm,"Root volatile profiles and herbivore preference are mediated by maize domestication, geographic spread, and modern breeding.","Domestication affected the abundances and diversity of maize root volatiles more than northward spread and modern breeding, and herbivore preference for roots was correlated with volatile diversity and herbivore resistance. Studies show that herbivore defenses in crops are mediated by domestication, spread, and breeding, among other human-driven processes. They also show that those processes affected chemical communication between crop plants and herbivores. We hypothesized that (i) preference of the herbivore (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) larvae for embryonic roots of maize (Zea mays mays) would increase and (ii) root volatile diversity would decrease with the crop's domestication, northward spread to present-day USA, and modern breeding. We used Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), Mexican and USA landrace maizes, and US inbred maize lines to test these hypotheses. We found that herbivore preference and volatile diversity increased with maize domestication and northward spread but decreased with modern breeding. Additionally, we found that the abundances of single volatiles did not consistently increase or decrease with maize domestication, spread, and breeding; rather, volatiles grouped per their abundances were differentially affected by those processes, and domestication had the greatest effects. Altogether, our results suggested that: the herbivore's preference for maize roots is correlated with volatile diversity and herbivore resistance; changes in abundances of individual volatiles are evident at the level of volatile groups; and maize domestication, but not spread and breeding, affected the abundances of some green leaf volatiles and sesquiterpenes/sesquiterpenoids. In part, we discussed our results in the context of herbivore defense evolution when resources for plant growth and defense vary across environments. We suggested that variability in relative abundance of volatiles may be associated with their local, functional relevance across wild and agricultural environments."
36564657,haploid production,"Variation in anthocyanin pigmentation by R1-navajo gene, development and validation of breeder-friendly markers specific to C1-Inhibitor locus for in-vivo haploid production in maize.","Background: In-vivo maternal haploids serve as the basis of doubled haploid (DH) breeding in maize. R1-navajo (R1-nj) gene governing anthocyanin colouration in the endosperm and embryo is widely used to identify haploid seeds. However, the expression of R1-nj depends on genetic-background of source-germplasm used for deriving DH-lines. Further, presence of C1-Inhibitor (C1-I) gene suppresses the expression of R1-nj, thus makes the selection of haploids difficult. Methods: In the present study, 178 subtropically-adapted maize inbreds were crossed with two R1-nj donors 'that do not have haploid induction genes'. Of these, 76.4% inbreds developed purple colour in endosperm, while 23.6% did not show any colouration. In case of scutellum, 62.9% inbreds possessed colour and 37.1% were colourless. The anthocyanin intensity varied greatly, with 19.66% and 42.98% inbreds displayed the least intensity, while 16.85% and 0.84% inbreds showed the highest intensity in endosperm and scutellum, respectively. Two C1-I specific breeder-friendly markers (MGU-CI-InDel8 and MGU-C1-SNP1) covering (i) 8 bp InDel and (ii) A to G SNP, respectively, were developed. MGU-CI-InDel8 and MGU-C1-SNP1 markers predicted presence of C1-I allele with 92.9% and 84.7% effectiveness, respectively. However, when both markers were considered together, they provided 100% effectiveness. Conclusions: These markers of C1-I gene would help in saving valuable resources and time during haploid induction in maize. The information generated here assume great significance in DH breeding of maize."
36573016,kernel size,Maize domestication phenotypes reveal strigolactone networks coordinating grain size evolution with kernel-bearing cupule architecture.,"The maize (Zea mays) ear represents one of the most striking domestication phenotypes in any crop species, with the cob conferring an exceptional yield advantage over the ancestral form of teosinte. Remodeling of the grain-bearing surface required profound developmental changes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and can only be partly attributed to the known domestication gene Teosinte glume architecture 1 (Tga1). Here we show that a more complete conversion involves strigolactones (SLs), and that these are prominent players not only in the Tga1 phenotype, but also other domestication features of the ear and kernel. Genetic combinations of a teosinte tga1 allele with three SL-related mutants progressively enhanced ancestral morphologies. The SL mutants, in addition to modulating the tga1 phenotype, also reshaped kernel-bearing pedicels and cupules in a teosinte-like manner. Genetic and molecular evidence are consistent with SL regulation of TGA1, including direct interaction of TGA1 with components of the SL-signaling system shown here to mediate TGA1 availability by sequestration. Roles of the SL network extend to enhancing maize seed size and, importantly, coordinating increased kernel growth with remodeling of protective maternal tissues. Collectively, our data show that SLs have central roles in releasing kernels from restrictive maternal encasement and coordinating other factors that increase kernel size, physical support, and their exposure on the grain-bearing surface."
36575905,response to Colletotrichum graminicola; response to Trichoderma spp.,Trichoderma root colonization triggers epigenetic changes in jasmonic and salicylic acid pathway-related genes.,"Beneficial interactions between plant-roots and Trichoderma spp. lead to a local and systemic enhancement of the plant immune system through a mechanism known as priming of defenses. In recent reports, we outlined a repertoire of genes and proteins differentially regulated in distant tissues of maize plants previously inoculated with Trichoderma atroviride. To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the systemic activation of plant responses, we continued evaluating the regulatory aspects of a selected group of genes when priming is triggered in maize plants. We conducted a time-course expression experiment from the beginning of the interaction between T. atroviride and maize roots, along plant vegetative growth and during Colletotrichum graminicola leaf infection. In addition to gene expression studies, the levels of jasmonic and salicylic acid were determined in the same samples for a comprehensive understanding of the gene expression results. Lastly, chromatin structure and modification assays were designed to evaluate the role of epigenetic marks during the long-lasting activation of the primed state of maize plants. The overall analysis of the results allowed us to shed some light on the interplay between the phytohormones and epigenetic regulatory events in the systemic and long-lasting regulation of maize plant defenses after Trichoderma inoculation."
36577386,response to Gibberella stalk rot,Fungal CFEM effectors negatively regulate a maize wall-associated kinase by interacting with its alternatively spliced variant to dampen resistance,"The fungus Fusarium graminearum causes a devastating disease Gibberella stalk rot of maize. Our knowledge of molecular interactions between F. graminearum effectors and maize immunity factors is lacking. Here, we show that a group of cysteine-rich common in fungal extracellular membrane (CFEM) domain proteins of F. graminearum are required for full virulence in maize stalk infection and that they interact with two secreted maize proteins, ZmLRR5 and ZmWAK17ET. ZmWAK17ET is an alternative splicing isoform of a wall-associated kinase ZmWAK17. Both ZmLRR5 and ZmWAK17ET interact with the extracellular domain of ZmWAK17. Transgenic maize overexpressing ZmWAK17 shows increased resistance to F. graminearum, while ZmWAK17 mutants exhibit enhanced susceptibility to F. graminearum. Transient expression of ZmWAK17 in Nicotiana benthamiana triggers hypersensitive cell death, whereas co-expression of CFEMs with ZmWAK17ET or ZmLRR5 suppresses the ZmWAK17-triggered cell death. Our results show that ZmWAK17 mediates stalk rot resistance and that F. graminearum delivers apoplastic CFEMs to compromise ZmWAK17-mediated resistance."
36585973,drought response,Overexpression of the maize genes ZmSKL1 and ZmSKL2 positively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Overexpression in Arabidopsis of the maize shikimate kinase-like genes SKL1 and SKL2 enhances tolerance to drought stress. The shikimate pathway has been reported to play an important role in plant signaling, reproduction, and development. However, its role in abiotic stress has not yet been reported. Here, two shikimate kinase-like genes, SKL1 and SKL2, were cloned from maize and their functions in mediating drought tolerance were investigated. Transcript levels of ZmSKL1 and ZmSKL2 in roots and leaves were strongly induced by drought stress. Both proteins were localized in the chloroplast. Furthermore, compared to the wild-type, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmSKL1 or ZmSKL2 exhibited improved drought stress tolerance through increases in relative water content and stomatal closure. Additionally, the transgenic lines showed reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species as a results of increased antioxidant enzyme activity. Interestingly, overexpression of ZmSKL1 or ZmSKL2 also increased sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid. In addition, the ROS-related and stress-responsive genes were activated in transgenic lines under drought stress. Moreover, ZmSKL1 and ZmSKL2 were found to separately interact with ZmASR3, which is an important regulatory protein in mediating drought tolerance, suggesting that ZmSKL1 and ZmSKL2, together with ZmASR3, are proteins that may confer drought tolerance as candidates in plant genetic breeding manipulations."
36588161,response to heat stress,Maize cytolines as models to study the impact of different cytoplasms on gene expression under heat stress conditions.,"Background: Crops are under constant pressure due to global warming, which unfolds at a much faster pace than their ability to adapt through evolution. Agronomic traits are linked to cytoplasmic-nuclear genome interactions. It thus becomes important to understand the influence exerted by the organelles on gene expression under heat stress conditions and profit from the available genetic diversity. Maize (Zea mays) cytolines allow us to investigate how the gene expression changes under heat stress conditions in three different cytoplasmic environments, but each having the same nucleus. Analyzing retrograde signaling in such an experimental set-up has never been done before. Here, we quantified the response of three cytolines to heat stress as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and studied gene expression patterns in the context of existing polymorphism in their organellar genomes. Results: Our study unveils a plethora of new genes and GO terms that are differentially expressed or enriched, respectively, in response to heat stress. We report 19,600 DEGs as responding to heat stress (out of 30,331 analyzed), which significantly enrich 164 GO biological processes, 30 GO molecular functions, and 83 GO cell components. Our approach allowed for the discovery of a significant number of DEGs and GO terms that are not common in the three cytolines and could therefore be linked to retrograde signaling. Filtering for DEGs with a fold regulation > 2 (absolute values) that are exclusive to just one of the cytolines, we find a total of 391 up- and down-DEGs. Similarly, there are 19 GO terms with a fold enrichment > 2 that are cytoline-specific. Using GBS data we report contrasting differences in the number of DEGs and GO terms in each cytoline, which correlate with the genetic distances between the mitochondrial genomes (but not chloroplast) and the original nuclei of the cytolines, respectively. Conclusions: The experimental design used here adds a new facet to the paradigm used to explain how gene expression changes in response to heat stress, capturing the influence exerted by different organelles upon one nucleus rather than investigating the response of several nuclei in their innate cytoplasmic environments."
36589048,nitrogen uptake,Aboveground herbivory does not affect mycorrhiza-dependent nitrogen acquisition from soil but inhibits mycorrhizal network-mediated nitrogen interplant transfer in maize.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture due to their ability to facilitate plant uptake of important mineral elements, such as nitrogen (N). However, plant mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake and interplant transfer may be highly context-dependent, and whether it is affected by aboveground herbivory remains largely unknown. Here, we used 15N labeling and tracking to examine the effect of aboveground insect herbivory by Spodoptera frugiperda on mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake in maize (Zea mays L.). To minimize consumption differences and 15N loss due to insect chewing, insect herbivory was simulated by mechanical wounding and oral secretion of S. frugiperda larvae. Inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis (Rir) significantly improved maize growth, and N/P uptake. The 15N labeling experiment showed that maize plants absorbed N from soils via the extraradical mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi and from neighboring plants transferred by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Simulated aboveground leaf herbivory did not affect mycorrhiza-mediated N acquisition from soil. However, CMN-mediated N transfer from neighboring plants was blocked by leaf simulated herbivory. Our findings suggest that aboveground herbivory inhibits CMN-mediated N transfer between plants but does not affect N acquisition from soil solutions via extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium."
36589078,drought response; response to Rhizophagus irregularis,Expression patterns of maize PIP aquaporins in middle or upper leaves correlate with their different physiological responses to drought and mycorrhiza.,"Here we report the effect of Rhizophagus irregularis on maize leaf expression of six plasma membrane aquaporin isoforms from PIP1 and PIP2 subfamilies under severe drought development and recovery. The novelty of our study is the finding that leaf-specific mycorrhizal regulation of aquaporins is dependent on the position of the leaf on the shoot and changes in parallel with the rate of photosynthesis and the stomatal response to drought. The transcripts were isolated from the upper third (L3) or ear (L5) leaf, which differed greatly in physiological response to stress within each symbiotic variant. Aquaporins expression in upper L3 leaves appeared to be largely not sensitive to drought, regardless of symbiotic status. In contrast, L5 leaf of non-mycorrhizal plants, showed strong down-regulation of all PIPs. Mycorrhiza, however, protected L5 leaf from such limitation, which under maximal stress was manifested by 6-fold and circa 4-fold higher transcripts level for PIP1s and PIP2s, respectively. Distinct expression patterns of L3 and L5 leaves corresponded to differences in key parameters of leaf homeostasis - stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rates, and accumulation of ABA and SA as phytohormonal indicators of drought stress. In result symbiotic plants showed faster restoration of photosynthetic capability, regardless of leaf position, which we recognize as the hallmark of better stress tolerance. In summary, arbuscular mycorrhiza alleviates short-term drought effects on maize by preventing the down-regulation of plasma membrane aquaporins within middle leaves, thereby affecting stomatal conductance."
36589123,"protein content, kernel",Genetic basis of maize kernel protein content revealed by high-density bin mapping using recombinant inbred lines.,"Maize with a high kernel protein content (PC) is desirable for human food and livestock fodder. However, improvements in its PC have been hampered by a lack of desirable molecular markers. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes for kernel PC, we employed a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy to construct a high-resolution linkage map with 6,433 bin markers for 275 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a high-PC female Ji846 and low-PC male Ye3189. The total genetic distance covered by the linkage map was 2180.93 cM, and the average distance between adjacent markers was 0.32 cM, with a physical distance of approximately 0.37 Mb. Using this linkage map, 11 QTLs affecting kernel PC were identified, including qPC7 and qPC2-2, which were identified in at least two environments. For the qPC2-2 locus, a marker named IndelPC2-2 was developed with closely linked polymorphisms in both parents, and when tested in 30 high and 30 low PC inbred lines, it showed significant differences (P = 1.9E-03). To identify the candidate genes for this locus, transcriptome sequencing data and PC best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) for 348 inbred lines were combined, and the expression levels of the four genes were correlated with PC. Among the four genes, Zm00001d002625, which encodes an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily protein, showed significantly different expression levels between two RIL parents in the endosperm and is speculated to be a potential candidate gene for qPC2-2. This study will contribute to further research on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of maize PC, while also providing a genetic basis for marker-assisted selection in the future."
36603079,response to Striga,Maize resistance to witchweed through changes in strigolactone biosynthesis,"Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple crop in Africa, where its yield and the livelihood of millions are compromised by the parasitic witchweed Striga. Germination of Striga is induced by strigolactones exuded from maize roots into the rhizosphere. In a maize germplasm collection, we identified two strigolactones, zealactol and zealactonoic acid, which stimulate less Striga germination than the major maize strigolactone, zealactone. We then showed that a single cytochrome P450, ZmCYP706C37, catalyzes a series of oxidative steps in the maize-strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Reduction in activity of this enzyme and two others involved in the pathway, ZmMAX1b and ZmCLAMT1, can change strigolactone composition and reduce Striga germination and infection. These results offer prospects for breeding Striga-resistant maize."
36613450,Abiotic stress response,QTL and Candidate Genes: Techniques and Advancement in Abiotic Stress Resistance Breeding of Major Cereals.,"At least 75% of the world's grain production comes from the three most important cereal crops: rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays). However, abiotic stressors such as heavy metal toxicity, salinity, low temperatures, and drought are all significant hazards to the growth and development of these grains. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) discovery and mapping have enhanced agricultural production and output by enabling plant breeders to better comprehend abiotic stress tolerance processes in cereals. Molecular markers and stable QTL are important for molecular breeding and candidate gene discovery, which may be utilized in transgenic or molecular introgression. Researchers can now study synteny between rice, maize, and wheat to gain a better understanding of the relationships between the QTL or genes that are important for a particular stress adaptation and phenotypic improvement in these cereals from analyzing reports on QTL and candidate genes. An overview of constitutive QTL, adaptive QTL, and significant stable multi-environment and multi-trait QTL is provided in this article as a solid framework for use and knowledge in genetic enhancement. Several QTL, such as DRO1 and Saltol, and other significant success cases are discussed in this review. We have highlighted techniques and advancements for abiotic stress tolerance breeding programs in cereals, the challenges encountered in introgressing beneficial QTL using traditional breeding techniques such as mutation breeding and marker-assisted selection (MAS), and the in roads made by new breeding methods such as genome-wide association studies (GWASs), the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis. A combination of these conventional and modern breeding approaches can be used to apply the QTL and candidate gene information in genetic improvement of cereals against abiotic stresses."
36614175,seed viability,Study of Seed Ageing in lpa1-1 Maize Mutant and Two Possible Approaches to Restore Seed Germination.,"Phytic acid (PA) is a strong anti-nutritional factor with a key antioxidant role in countering reactive oxygen species. Despite the potential benefits of low phytic acid (lpa) mutants, the reduction of PA causes pleiotropic effects, e.g., reduced seed germination and viability loss related to seed ageing. The current study evaluated a historical series of naturally aged seeds and showed that lpa1-1 seeds aged faster as compared to wildtype. To mimic natural ageing, the present study set up accelerated ageing treatments at different temperatures. It was found that incubating the seeds at 57 °C for 24 h, the wildtype germinated at 82.4% and lpa1-1 at 40%. The current study also hypothesized two possible solutions to overcome these problems: (1) Classical breeding was used to constitute synthetic populations carrying the lpa1-1 mutation, with genes pushing anthocyanin accumulation in the embryo (R-navajo allele). The outcome showed that the presence of R-navajo in the lpa1-1 genotype was not able to improve the germinability (-20%), but this approach could be useful to improve the germinability in non-mutant genotypes (+17%). (2) In addition, hydropriming was tested on lpa1-1 and wildtype seeds, and germination was improved by 20% in lpa1-1, suggesting a positive role of seed priming in restoring germination. Moreover, the data highlighted metabolic differences in the metabolome before and after hydropriming treatment, suggesting that the differences in germination could also be mediated by differences in the metabolic composition induced by the mutation."
36616197,response to salt,"Effect of Salt Stress on the Activity, Expression, and Promoter Methylation of Succinate Dehydrogenase and Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase in Maize (Zea mays L.) Leaves.","The effect of salt stress on the expression of genes, the methylation of their promoters, and the enzymatic activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) was investigated in maize (Zea mays L.). The incubation of maize seedlings in a 150 mM NaCl solution for 24 h led to a several-fold increase in the activity of SSADH that peaked at 6 h of NaCl treatment, which was preceded by an increase in the Ssadh1 gene expression and a decrease in its promoter methylation observed at 3 h of salt stress. The increase in SDH activity and succinate oxidation by mitochondria was slower, developing by 24 h of NaCl treatment, which corresponded to the increase in expression of the genes Sdh1-2 and Sdh2-3 encoding SDH catalytic subunits and of the gene Sdh3-1 encoding the anchoring SDH subunit. The increase in the Sdh2-3 expression was accompanied by the decrease in promoter methylation. It is concluded that salt stress results in the rapid increase in succinate production via SSADH operating in the GABA shunt, which leads to the activation of SDH, the process partially regulated via epigenetic mechanisms. The role of succinate metabolism under the conditions of salt stress is discussed."
36616288,response to cold stress,Transcriptome Analysis Identifies Novel Genes Associated with Low-Temperature Seed Germination in Sweet Corn.,"Typically, sweet corn, particularly sh2 sweet corn, has low seed vigor owing to its high sugar and low starch content, which is a major problem in sweet corn production, particularly at low temperatures. There is considerable variation in the germination rates among sweet corn varieties under low-temperature conditions, and the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. In this study, we screened two inbred sweet corn lines (tolerant line L282 and sensitive line L693) differing in their low-temperature germination rates; while no difference was observed in their germination rates at normal temperatures. To identify the specifically induced genes influencing the germination capacity of sweet corn at low temperatures, a transcriptome analysis of the two lines was conducted at both normal and low temperatures. Compared to the lines at a normal temperature, 3926 and 1404 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from L282 and L693, respectively, under low-temperature conditions. Of them, 830 DEGs were common DEGs (cDEGs) that were identified from both L282 and L693, which were majorly enriched in terms of microtubule-based processes, histone H3-K9 modification, single-organism cellular processes, and carbohydrate metabolic processes. In addition, 3096 special DEGs (sDEGs), with 2199 upregulated and 897 downregulated, were detected in the tolerant line L282, but not in the sensitive line L693. These sDEGs were primarily related to plasma membranes and oxygen-containing compounds. Furthermore, electric conductivity measurements demonstrated that the membrane of L282 experienced less damage, which is consistent with its strong tolerance at low temperatures. These results expand our understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in the cold germination of sweet corn and provide a set of candidate genes for further genetic analysis."
36618673,response to climate change,Genome-wide identification of sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase genes in maize and their responses to abiotic stresses.,"Protein kinases play an important role in plants in response to environmental changes through signal transduction. As a large family of protein kinases, sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related kinases (SnRKs) were found and functionally verified in many plants. Nevertheless, little is known about the SnRK family of Zea mays.Evolutionary relationships, chromosome locations, gene structures, conserved motifs, and cis-elements in promoter regions were systematically analyzed. Besides, tissue-specific and stress-induced expression patterns of ZmSnRKs were determined. Finally, functional regulatory networks between ZmSnRKs and other proteins or miRNAs were constructed.In total, 60 SnRK genes located on 10 chromosomes were discovered in maize. ZmSnRKs were classified into three subfamilies (ZmSnRK1, ZmSnRK2, and ZmSnRK3), consisting of 4, 14, and 42 genes, respectively. Gene structure analysis showed that 33 of the 42 ZmSnRK3 genes contained only one exon. Most ZmSnRK genes contained at least one ABRE, MBS, and LTR cis-element and a few ZmSnRK genes had AuxRR-core, P-box, MBSI, and SARE ciselements in their promoter regions. The Ka:Ks ratio of 22 paralogous ZmSnRK gene pairs revealed that the ZmSnRK gene family had experienced a purifying selection. Meanwhile, we analyzed the expression profiles of ZmSnRKs, and they exhibited significant differences in various tissues and abiotic stresses. In addition, A total of eight ZmPP2Cs, which can interact with ZmSnRK proteins, and 46 miRNAs, which can target 24 ZmSnRKs, were identified. Generally, these results provide valuable information for further function verification of ZmSnRKs, and improve our understanding of the role of ZmSnRKs in the climate resilience of maize."
36619433,zinc content; iron uptake,Quantitative trait loci and candidate genes for iron and zinc bio-fortification in genetically diverse germplasm of maize (Zea mays L): A systematic review.,"Genetically and economically, Maize plays a pivotal role in tackling Iron-Zinc mineral deficiency through the crop's biofortification approach to high-yielding cultivars. The objective of this study is to summarize quantitative trait loci (QTL) is useful for identifying novel genes of interest in diverse germplasm for understanding the exact genetic mechanism for Iron and zinc uptake, deposition, and biosynthesis in Zea mays L endosperm. various techniques like Germplasm Genetic Wide Association, QTL meta-analysis, and biparental linkage analysis are used by researchers in diverse germplasm of Maize for the gene of interest marking and are extracted as secondary information through a systematic review of scientific published sources in peer-reviewed sites. A literature review was focused on quantitative trait loci with candidate genes from different families like YS, NRAMP, ferritin, Cation efflux, etc., and cloned four phytase soluble genes which influence the concentration as well as bioavailability of Fe & Zn in the endosperm. More than 30 QTLs with 15-Fe, 17-Zn; 10 Meta QTLS are common and linked with micronutrient concentration as well 17 candidate genes from different families are responsible for the zinc-iron deposition on the endosperm. More than 46 Fe-Zn (20 + 26) SNPs and 22 SNPs (10 + 12) on nine different chromosomes play a significant role in the variation of the mineral value of inbreeds and Double haploid Bi-parental population of Zea mays L. In Rice and Maize, five different chromosomes are collinear for the uptake to deposition of these minerals in the endosperm. The success of marker-based biofortification depends upon the nature of germplasm, the gap between flanking marker and targeted genes, the selection of genotypes in each generation, and genotype-environment interaction which are the future area of study. This study can assist the breeders in fast-tracking Fe and Zn biofortification through frequency multiplication of these desired loci of Maize."
36627574,response to phosphorus; zinc content,The auxin signaling pathway contributes to phosphorus-mediated zinc homeostasis in maize.,"Although the interaction between P and Zn has long been recognized in plants, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying P and Zn interactions are poorly understood. We show here that P supply decreases the Zn concentration in maize shoots and roots. Compared to +P + Zn (addition of both P and Zn), +P-Zn reduced and -P-Zn increased the total length of 1° lateral roots (LRs). Under +P + Zn, both P and Zn concentrations were lower in the sl1 mutant roots than in wild-type (WT) maize roots, and P accumulation did not reduce the Zn concentration in ll1 mutant roots. Transcriptome profiling showed that the auxin signaling pathway contributed to P-mediated Zn homeostasis in maize. Auxin production and distribution were altered by changes in P and Zn supply. Cytosolic Zn co-localized with auxin accumulation under +P + Zn. Exogenous application of 1-NAA and L-Kyn altered the P-mediated root system architecture (RSA) under Zn deficiency. -P-Zn repressed the expression of miR167. Overexpression of ZmMIR167b increased the lengths of 1° LRs and the concentrations of P and Zn in maize. These results indicate that auxin-dependent RSA is important for P-mediated Zn homeostasis in maize.HighlightAuxin-dependent RSA is important for P-mediated Zn homeostasis in maize."
36636793,root lodging; root angle; gravitropism,Local Auxin Biosynthesis Regulates Brace Root Angle and Lodging Resistance in Maize.,"Root lodging poses a major threat to maize production, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality, and increased harvest costs. Here, we combined expressional, genetic and cytological studies to demonstrate a role of ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 in regulating gravitropic response of the brace root and lodging resistance in maize. We show that both ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 are preferentially expressed in root tips with partially overlapping expression patterns, and the protein products of ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 are localized in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively. The Zmyuc4 single mutant and Zmyuc2/4 double mutant exhibit enlarged brace root angle compared to the wild type plants, with larger brace root angle being observed in the Zmyuc2/4 double mutant. Consistently, the brace root tips of the Zmyuc4 single mutant and Zmyuc2/4 double mutant accumulate less auxin and are defective in proper reallocation of auxin in response to gravi-stimuli. Further, we show that the Zmyuc4 single mutant and the Zmyuc2/4 double mutant display obviously enhanced root lodging resistance. Our combined results demonstrate that ZmYUC2- and ZmYUC4-mediated local auxin biosynthesis is required for normal gravity response of the brace roots and provide effective targets for breeding root lodging resistant maize cultivars."
36648157,grain filling rate; grain filling duration,Understanding the regulation of cereal grain filling: The way forward.,"During grain filling, starch and other nutrients accumulate in endosperm; this directly determines grain yield and grain quality in crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Grain filling is a complex trait affected by both intrinsic and environmental factors, making it difficult to explore the underlying genetics, molecular regulation, and the application of these genes for breeding. With the development of powerful genetic and molecular techniques, much has been learned about the genes and molecular networks related to grain filling over the past decades. In this review, we highlight the key factors affecting grain filling, including both biological and abiotic factors. We then summarize the key genes controlling grain filling and their roles in this event, including regulators of sugar translocation and starch biosynthesis, phytohormone-related regulators, and other factors. Finally, we discuss how the current knowledge of valuable grain filling genes could be integrated with strategies for breeding cereal varieties with improved grain yield and quality."
36658178,aleurone color; pericarp color,Breaking the tight genetic linkage between the a1 and sh2 genes led to the development of anthocyanin-rich purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn.,"The existence of purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn based on the supersweet mutation, shrunken2 (sh2), has not been previously reported, due to its extremely tight genetic linkage to a non-functional anthocyanin biosynthesis gene, anthocyaninless1 (a1). Generally, pericarp-pigmented starchy purple corn contains significantly higher anthocyanin. The development of purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn is dependent on breaking the a1-sh2 tight genetic linkage, which occurs at a very low frequency of < 1 in 1000 meiotic crossovers. Here, to develop purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn, an initial cross between a male purple-pericarp maize, ""Costa Rica"" (A1Sh2.A1Sh2) and a female white shrunken2 super-sweetcorn, ""Tims-white"" (a1sh2.a1sh2), was conducted. Subsequent self-pollination based on purple-pericarp-shrunken kernels identified a small frequency (0.08%) of initial heterozygous F3 segregants (A1a1.sh2sh2) producing a fully sh2 cob with a purple-pericarp phenotype, enabled by breaking the close genetic linkage between the a1 and sh2 genes. Resulting rounds of self-pollination generated a F6 homozygous purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn (A1A1.sh2sh2) line, 'Tim1'. Genome sequencing revealed a recombination break between the a1 and yz1 genes of the a1-yz1-x1-sh2  multigenic interval. The novel purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn produced a similar concentration of anthocyanin and sugar as in its purple-pericarp maize and white super-sweetcorn parents, respectively, potentially adding a broader range of health benefits than currently exists with standard yellow/white sweetcorn."
36672935,Stress response,Wide-Range Portrayal of AP2/ERF Transcription Factor Family in Maize (Zea mays L.) Development and Stress Responses.,"The APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive Transcriptional Factors containing conservative AP2/ERF domains constituted a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) superfamily, called AP2/ERF. The configuration of the AP2/ERF superfamily in maize has remained unresolved. In this study, we identified the 229 AP2/ERF genes in the latest (B73 RefGen_v5) maize reference genome. Phylogenetic classification of the ZmAP2/ERF family members categorized it into five clades, including 27 AP2 (APETALA2), 5 RAV (Related to ABI3/VP), 89 DREB (dehydration responsive element binding), 105 ERF (ethylene responsive factors), and a soloist. The duplication events of the paralogous genes occurred from 1.724-25.855 MYA, a key route to maize evolution. Structural analysis reveals that they have more introns and few exons. The results showed that 32 ZmAP2/ERFs regulate biotic stresses, and 24 ZmAP2/ERFs are involved in responses towards abiotic stresses. Additionally, the expression analysis showed that DREB family members are involved in plant sex determination. The real-time quantitative expression profiling of ZmAP2/ERFs in the leaves of the maize inbred line B73 under ABA, JA, salt, drought, heat, and wounding stress revealed their specific expression patterns. Conclusively, this study unveiled the evolutionary pathway of ZmAP2/ERFs and its essential role in stress and developmental processes. The generated information will be useful for stress resilience maize breeding programs."
36679015,tassel branch number; ear height; plant height,Genome-Wide Association Study and Genomic Prediction on Plant Architecture Traits in Sweet Corn and Waxy Corn.,"Sweet corn and waxy corn has a better taste and higher accumulated nutritional value than regular maize, and is widely planted and popularly consumed throughout the world. Plant height (PH), ear height (EH), and tassel branch number (TBN) are key plant architecture traits, which play an important role in improving grain yield in maize. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction analysis were conducted on plant architecture traits of PH, EH, and TBN in a fresh edible maize population consisting of 190 sweet corn inbred lines and 287 waxy corn inbred lines. Phenotypic data from two locations showed high heritability for all three traits, with significant differences observed between sweet corn and waxy corn for both PH and EH. The differences between the three subgroups of sweet corn were not obvious for all three traits. Population structure and PCA analysis results divided the whole population into three subgroups, i.e., sweet corn, waxy corn, and the subgroup mixed with sweet and waxy corn. Analysis of GWAS was conducted with 278,592 SNPs obtained from resequencing data; 184, 45, and 68 significantly associated SNPs were detected for PH, EH, and TBN, respectively. The phenotypic variance explained (PVE) values of these significant SNPs ranged from 3.50% to 7.0%. The results of this study lay the foundation for further understanding the genetic basis of plant architecture traits in sweet corn and waxy corn. Genomic selection (GS) is a new approach for improving quantitative traits in large plant breeding populations that uses whole-genome molecular markers. The marker number and marker quality are essential for the application of GS in maize breeding. GWAS can choose the most related markers with the traits, so it can be used to improve the predictive accuracy of GS."
36683443,days to flowering; photoperiod response,Environment-specific selection alters flowering-time plasticity and results in pervasive pleiotropic responses in maize.,"Crop genetic diversity for climate adaptations is globally partitioned. We performed experimental evolution in maize to understand how plant germplasm can be moved across geographical zones. Initialized with a common population of tropical origin, artificial selection on flowering time was performed for two generations at eight field sites spanning 25 degrees latitude, a 2,800 km transect. We then jointly tested all selection lineages across the original sites of selection, for the target trait and 23 other traits. Modeling intergenerational shifts in a physiological reaction norm revealed separate components for flowering-time plasticity underlying generalized and local modes of selection. In turn, selection altered the plasticity of each lineage, leading to a latitudinal pattern in the responses to selection that were strongly driven by photoperiod. This transformation led to widespread changes in developmental, architectural, and yield traits, expressed collectively in an environment-dependent manner. Furthermore, selection for flowering time alone alleviated a maladaptive syndrome and improved yields for tropical maize in the temperate zone. Our findings show how phenotypic selection can rapidly shift the flowering phenology and plasticity of maize. They also demonstrate that selecting crops to local conditions can accelerate adaptation to climate change."
36683566,response to Fusarium ear rot,ZmSIZ1a and ZmSIZ1b play an indispensable role in resistance against Fusarium ear rot in maize.,"Fusarium ear rot (FER) is a destructive fungal disease of maize caused by Fusarium verticillioides. FER resistance is a typical complex quantitative trait controlled by micro-effect genes, leading to difficulty in identifying the host resistance genes. SIZ1 encodes a SUMO E3 ligase regulating a wide range of plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, the function of ZmSIZ1 remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ZmSIZ1a and ZmSIZ1b possess SUMO E3 ligase activity, and that the Zmsiz1a/1b double mutant, but not the Zmsiz1a or Zmsiz1b single mutants, exhibits severely impaired resistance to FER. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in plant disease resistance-related pathways, especially in plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signalling, and plant hormone signal transduction. Thirty-five candidate genes were identified in these pathways. Furthermore, the integration of the transcriptome and metabolome data revealed that the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was induced by F. verticillioides infection, and that accumulation of flavone and flavonol was significantly reduced in the Zmsiz1a/1b double mutant. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that ZmSIZ1a and ZmSIZ1b play a redundant, but indispensable role against FER, and provide potential new gene resources for molecular breeding of FER-resistant maize cultivars."
36684736,water use efficiency,Root pruning improves maize water-use efficiency by root water absorption.,"Root systems are an important component of plants that impact crop water-use efficiency (WUE) and yield. This study examined the effects of root pruning on maize yield, WUE, and water uptake under pot and hydroponic conditions. The pot experiment showed that root pruning significantly decreased root/shoot ratio. Both small root pruning (cut off about 1/5 of the root system, RP1) and large root pruning (cut off about 1/3 of the root system, RP2) improved WUE and root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) in the residual root system. Compared with that in the un-cut control, at the jointing stage, RP1 and RP2 increased Lpr by 43.9% and 31.5% under well-watered conditions and 27.4% and 19.8% under drought stress, respectively. RP1 increased grain yield by 12.9% compared with that in the control under well-watered conditions, whereas both pruning treatments did not exhibit a significant effect on yield under drought stress. The hydroponic experiment demonstrated that root pruning did not reduce leaf water potential but increased residual root hydraulic conductivity by 26.2% at 48 h after root pruning under well-watered conditions. The foregoing responses may be explained by the upregulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein gene and increases in abscisic acid and jasmonic acid in roots. Increased auxin and salicylic acid contributed to the compensated lateral root growth. In conclusion, root pruning improved WUE in maize by root water uptake."
36691663,carotenoid content,l-Tryptophan synergistically increased carotenoid accumulation with blue light in maize (Zea mays L.) sprouts,"In the present study, l-tryptophan was applied in combination with blue light to modulate carotenoid biosynthesis in maize sprouts. The profiles of carotenoids, chlorophylls, and relative genes in carotenoid biosynthesis and light signaling pathways were studied. l-tryptophan and blue light both promoted the accumulation of carotenoids, and their combination further increased carotenoid content by 120%. l-tryptophan exerted auxin-like effects and stimulated PSY expression in blue light exposure maize sprouts, resulting in increased α- and β- carotenes. l-tryptophan could also play a photoprotective role through the xanthophyll cycle under blue light. In addition, CRY in the light signaling pathway was critical for carotenoid biosynthesis. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and l-tryptophan could be used in conjunction with blue light to fortify carotenoids in maize sprouts."
36708192,root morphology,RootSlice - a novel functional-structural model for root anatomical phenotypes.,"Root anatomy is an important determinant of root metabolic costs, soil exploration, and soil resource capture. Root anatomy varies substantially within and among plant species. RootSlice is a multicellular functional-structural model of root anatomy developed to facilitate the analysis and understanding of root anatomical phenotypes. RootSlice can capture phenotypically accurate root anatomy in three dimensions of different root classes and developmental zones, of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Several case studies are presented illustrating the capabilities of the model. For maize nodal roots, the model illustrated the role of vacuole expansion in cell elongation; and confirmed the individual and synergistic role of increasing root cortical aerenchyma and reducing the number of cortical cell files in reducing root metabolic costs. Integration of RootSlice for different root zones as the temporal properties of the nodal roots in the whole-plant and soil model OpenSimRoot/maize enabled the multiscale evaluation of root anatomical phenotypes, highlighting the role of aerenchyma formation in enhancing the utility of cortical cell files for improving plant performance over varying soil nitrogen supply. Such integrative in silico approaches present avenues for exploring the fitness landscape of root anatomical phenotypes."
36713079,response to Striga,Mapping quantitative trait loci and predicting candidate genes for Striga resistance in maize using resistance donor line derived from Zea diploperennis.,"The parasitic weed, Striga is a major biological constraint to cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and threatens food and nutrition security. Two hundred and twenty-three (223) F2:3 mapping population involving individuals derived from TZdEI 352 x TZEI 916 were phenotyped for four Striga-adaptive traits and genotyped using the Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) to determine the genomic regions responsible for Striga resistance in maize. After removing distorted SNP markers, a genetic linkage map was constructed using 1,918 DArTseq markers which covered 2092.1 cM. Using the inclusive composite interval mapping method in IciMapping, twenty-three QTLs influencing Striga resistance traits were identified across four Striga-infested environments with five stable QTLs (qGY4, qSC2.1, qSC2.2, qSC5, and qSC6) detected in more than one environment. The variations explained by the QTLs ranged from 4.1% (qSD2.3) to 14.4% (qSC7.1). Six QTLs each with significant additive × environment interactions were also identified for grain yield and Striga damage. Gene annotation revealed candidate genes underlying the QTLs, including the gene models GRMZM2G077002 and GRMZM2G404973 which encode the GATA transcription factors, GRMZM2G178998 and GRMZM2G134073 encoding the NAC transcription factors, GRMZM2G053868 and GRMZM2G157068 which encode the nitrate transporter protein and GRMZM2G371033 encoding the SBP-transcription factor. These candidate genes play crucial roles in plant growth and developmental processes and defense functions. This study provides further insights into the genetic mechanisms of resistance to Striga parasitism in maize. The QTL detected in more than one environment would be useful for further fine-mapping and marker-assisted selection for the development of Striga resistant and high-yielding maize cultivars."
36715587,response to Colletotrichum graminicola; response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; response to Ustilago maydis,A non-JA producing oxophytodienoate reductase functions in salicylic acid-mediated antagonism with jasmonic acid during pathogen attack.,"Peroxisome-localized oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductases (OPR) are enzymes converting 12-OPDA into jasmonic acid (JA). However, the biochemical and physiological functions of the cytoplasmic non-JA producing OPRs remain largely unknown. Here, we generated Mutator-insertional mutants of the maize OPR2 gene and tested its role in resistance to pathogens with distinct lifestyles. Functional analyses showed that the opr2 mutants were more susceptible to the (hemi)biotrophic pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola and Ustilago maydis, but were more resistant to the necrotrophic fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Hormone profiling revealed that increased susceptibility to C. graminicola was associated with decreased salicylic acid (SA) but increased JA levels. Mutation of the JA-producing lipoxygenase 10 (LOX10) reversed this phenotype in the opr2 mutant background, corroborating the notion that JA promotes susceptibility to this pathogen. Exogenous SA did not rescue normal resistance levels in opr2 mutants, suggesting that this SA-inducible gene is the key downstream component of the SA-mediated defences against C. graminicola. Disease assays of the single and double opr2 and lox10 mutants and the JA-deficient opr7opr8 mutants showed that OPR2 negatively regulates JA biosynthesis, and that JA is required for resistance against C. heterostrophus. Overall, this study uncovers a novel function of a non-JA producing OPR as a major negative regulator of JA biosynthesis during pathogen infection, a function that leads to its contrasting contribution to either resistance or susceptibility depending on pathogen lifestyle."
36717785,response to salt,Integrated single-molecule real-time sequencing and RNA sequencing reveal the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in a novel synthesized polyploid genetic bridge between maize and its wild relatives.,"Background: Tripsacum dactyloides (2n = 4x = 72) and Zea perennis (2n = 4x = 40) are tertiary gene pools of Zea mays L. and exhibit many abiotic adaptations absent in modern maize, especially salt tolerance. A previously reported allopolyploid (hereafter referred to as MTP, 2n = 74) synthesized using Zea mays, Tripsacum dactyloides, and Zea perennis has even stronger salt tolerance than Z. perennis and T. dactyloides. This allopolyploid will be a powerful genetic bridge for the genetic improvement of maize. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its salt tolerance, as well as the key genes involved in regulating its salt tolerance, remain unclear. Results: Single-molecule real-time sequencing and RNA sequencing were used to identify the genes involved in salt tolerance and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Based on the SMRT-seq results, we obtained 227,375 reference unigenes with an average length of 2300 bp; most of the unigenes were annotated to Z. mays sequences (76.5%) in the NR database. Moreover, a total of 484 and 1053 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that multiple pathways responded to salt stress, including ""Flavonoid biosynthesis,"" ""Oxidoreductase activity,"" and ""Plant hormone signal transduction"" in the leaves and roots, and ""Iron ion binding,"" ""Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity,"" and ""Serine-type carboxypeptidase activity"" in the roots. Transcription factors, such as those in the WRKY, B3-ARF, and bHLH families, and cytokinin negatively regulators negatively regulated the salt stress response. According to the results of the short time series-expression miner analysis, proteins involved in ""Spliceosome"" and ""MAPK signal pathway"" dynamically responded to salt stress as salinity changed. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that heat shock proteins play a role in the large interaction network regulating salt tolerance. Conclusions: Our results reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of MTP in the response to salt stress and abundant salt-tolerance-related unigenes. These findings will aid the retrieval of lost alleles in modern maize and provide a new approach for using T. dactyloides and Z. perennis to improve maize."
36721267,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,A Leucine Rich Repeat Receptor Kinase Gene Confers Quantitative Susceptibility to Maize Southern Leaf Blight.,"Southern leaf blight (SLB), caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus (anamorph Bipolaris maydis), is a major foliar disease which causes significant yield losses in maize worldwide. A major quantitative trait locus, qSLB3.04 , conferring recessive resistance to SLB was previously mapped on maize chromosome 3. Using a combination of map-based cloning, association analysis, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and transposon mutagenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 editing, we demonstrate that a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene which we have called ChSK1 (Cochliobolus heterostrophus Susceptibility Kinase 1) at qSLB3.04 causes increased susceptibility to SLB. Genes of this type have generally been associated with the defense response. We present evidence that ChSK1 may be associated with suppression of the basal immune response. These findings contribute to our understanding of plant disease susceptibility genes and the potential to use them for engineering durable disease resistance."
36721376,response to Gibberella ear rot,Genome-wide association study discovers novel germplasm resources and genetic loci with resistance to Gibberella ear rot caused by Fusarium graminearum.,"Gibberella ear rot (GER) in maize caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most devastating maize diseases reducing grain yield and quality worldwide. The genetic bases of maize GER resistance remain largely unknown. Using artificial inoculation across multiple environments, GER severity of an association panel consisting of 316 diverse inbred lines was observed with wide phenotypic variation. In the association panel, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a general linear model (GLM) identified 69 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with GER resistance at the threshold of 2.04 x 10-5, and the average phenotypic variation explained (PVE) of these SNPs was 5.09%. We also conducted a GWAS analysis using a mixed linear model (MLM) at a threshold of 1.0 x 10-4, and 16 significant association SNPs with an average PVE of 4.73% were detected. A combined GLM and MLM method obtained 10 co-localized significant association SNPs linked to GER resistance including the most significant SNP (PZE-105079915) with the greatest PVE value, 9.07%, at bin 5.05 following ten candidate genes. These findings are significant for the exploration of the complicated genetic variations in maize GER resistance. The regions and genes identified herein provide a list of candidate targets for further investigation, in addition to the elite germplasm resources that can be used for breeding GER resistance in maize."
36722259,kernel development,Tetratricopeptide-containing SMK11 is essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in maize mitochondria.,"Assembly of the functional complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires sophisticated and efficient regulatory mechanisms. In plants, the subunit composition and assembly factors involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) are substantially less defined than in mammals and yeast. In this study, we cloned maize (Zea mays) Small kernel 11 (Smk11) via map-based cloning. Smk11 encodes a mitochondria-localized tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein. Disruption of Smk11 severely affected the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex IV, leading to delayed plant growth and seed development. Protein interactions studies revealed that SMK11 might interact with four putative complex IV assembly factors, Inner membrane peptidase 1A (ZmIMP1A), MYB domain protein 3R3 (ZmMYB3R-3), Cytochrome c oxidase 23 (ZmCOX23), and Mitochondrial ferredoxin 1 (ZmMFDX1), among which ZmMFDX1 might interact with subunits ZmCOX6a and ZmCOX-X1; ZmMYB3R-3 might also interact with ZmCOX6a. The mutation of SMK11 perturbed the normal assembly of these subunits, leading to the inactivation of complex IV. The results of this study revealed that SMK11 serves as an accessory assembly factor required for the normal assembly of subunits into complex IV, which will accelerate the elucidation of the assembly of complex IV in plant mitochondria."
36723989,response to nitrogen,Estimating the genetic parameters of yield-related traits under different nitrogen conditions in maize.,"Understanding the genetic basis responding to nitrogen (N) fertilization in crop production is a long-standing research topic in plant breeding and genetics. Albeit years of continuous efforts, the genetic architecture parameters, such as heritability, polygenicity, and mode of selection, underlying the N responses in maize remain largely unclear. In this study, about n = 230 maize inbred lines were phenotyped under high N (HN) and low N (LN) conditions for two consecutive years to obtain six yield-related traits. Heritability analyses suggested that traits highly responsive to N treatments were less heritable. Using publicly available SNP genotypes, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify n = 237 and n = 130 trait-associated loci (TALs) under HN and LN conditions, n = 164 for N-responsive (NR) traits, and n = 31 for genotype by N interaction (G × N). Furthermore, genome-wide complex trait Bayesian (GCTB) analysis, a method complementary to GWAS, was performed to estimate genetic parameters, including genetic polygenicity and the mode of selection (S). GCTB results suggested that the NR value of a yield component trait was highly polygenic and that four NR traits exhibited negative correlations between SNP effects and their minor allele frequencies (or the S value < 0)-a pattern consistent with negative selection to purge deleterious alleles. This study reveals the complex genetic architecture underlying N responses for yield-related traits and provides candidate genetic loci for N resilient maize improvement."
36737696,root development,Auxin efflux carrier ZmPIN1a modulates auxin reallocation involved in nitrate-mediated root formation.,"Background: Auxin plays a crucial role in nitrate (NO3-)-mediated root architecture, and it is still unclear that if NO3- supply modulates auxin reallocation for regulating root formation in maize (Zea mays L.). This study was conducted to investigate the role of auxin efflux carrier ZmPIN1a in the root formation in response to NO3- supply. Results: Low NO3- (LN) promoted primary root (PR) elongation, while repressed the development of lateral root primordia (LRP) and total root length. LN modulated auxin levels and polar transport and regulated the expression of auxin-responsive and -signaling genes in roots. Moreover, LN up-regulated the expression level of ZmPIN1a, and overexpression of ZmPIN1a enhanced IAA efflux and accumulation in PR tip, while repressed IAA accumulation in LRP initiation zone, which consequently induced LN-mediated PR elongation and LR inhibition. The inhibition rate of PR length, LRP density and number of ZmPIN1a-OE plants was higher than that of wild-type plants after auxin transport inhibitor NPA treatment under NN and LN conditions, and the degree of inhibition of root growth in ZmPIN1a-OE plants was more obvious under LN condition. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ZmPIN1a was involved in modulating auxin levels and transport to alter NO3--mediated root formation in maize."
36743547,drought response,Transcriptome analysis in contrasting maize inbred lines and functional analysis of five maize NAC genes under drought stress treatment.,"Drought substantially influences crop growth and development. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) have received much attention for their critical roles in drought stress responses. To explore the maize NAC genes in response to drought stress, the transcriptome sequencing data of NAC TFs in two maize inbred lines, the drought tolerance line H082183 and the sensitive line Lv28, were used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). There were 129 maize NAC protein-coding genes identified, of which 15 and 20 NAC genes were differentially expressed between the two genotypes under MD and SD treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, the phylogenetic relationship of 152 non-redundant NAC family TFs in maize was generated. The maize NAC family proteins were grouped into 13 distinct subfamilies. Five drought stress-responsive NAC family members, which were designed as ZmNAP, ZmNAC19, ZmNAC4, ZmJUB1(JUBGBRUNNEN1), and ZmNAC87, were selected for further study. The expression of ZmNAP, ZmNAC19, ZmNAC4, ZmJUB1, and ZmNAC87 were significantly induced by drought, dehydration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. The overexpressing Arabidopsis of these five NAC genes was generated for functional characterization, respectively. Under different concentrations of NaCl, D-mannitol stress, and ABA treatments, the sensitivity of ZmNAP-, ZmNAC19-, ZmNAC4-, ZmJUB1-, and ZmNAC87-overexpressing lines was significantly increased at the germination stage compared to the wild-type lines. The overexpression of these five NAC members significantly improved the drought stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid screening analysis revealed that ZmNAP may cooperatively interact with 11 proteins including ZmNAC19 to activate the drought stress response. The above results inferred that ZmNAP, ZmNAC19, ZmNAC4, ZmJUB1, and ZmNAC87 may play important roles in the plant response to drought stress and may be useful in bioengineering breeding and drought tolerance improvement."
36745624,response to Chilo partellus,Host-induced silencing of the CpCHI gene resulted in developmental abnormalities and mortality in maize stem borer (Chilo partellus).,"RNAi-based insecticides for crop protection have witnessed rapid improvement over the years. However, their potential to efficiently control maize stem borer (Chilo partellus) pests has remained underexplored. In this study, double-stranded C. partellus chitinase (dsCHI) toxicity was investigated in C. partellus larvae. Furthermore, we developed transgenic maize lines expressing dsRNA targeted against C. partellus chitinase transcripts and performed detached leaf insect feeding bioassays. Our results revealed that C. partellus chitinase transcript expression was significantly downregulated by 57% and 82% in the larvae. Larvae exhibited various phenotypic distortion levels across developmental stages, and 53% mortality occurred in transgenic fed larvae compared to those fed on nontransgenic leaves. In conclusion, we have identified the C. partellus chitinase gene as a potential target for RNAi-mediated control and demonstrated that oral delivery via bacteria and plant-mediated delivery are viable means of achieving C. partellus RNAi-mediated control."
36773263,response to nicosulfuron,Nicosulfuron stress on the glyoxalase system and endogenous hormone content in sweet maize seedlings.,"To reduce the harmful effects of nicosulfuron on sweet corn, the physiological regulation mechanism of sweet corn detoxification was studied. This study analyzed the effects of nicosulfuron stress on the glyoxalase system, hormone content, and key gene expression of nicosulfuron-tolerant ""HK301"" and nicosulfuron-sensitive ""HK320"" sweet corn seedling sister lines. After spraying nicosulfuron, the methylglyoxal (MG) content in HK301 increased first and then decreased. Glyoxalase I (GlyI) and glyoxalase II (GlyII) activities, non-enzymatic glutathione (GSH), and the glutathione redox state glutathione/(glutathione + glutathione disulfide) (GSH/(GSH + GSSG)) showed a similar trend as the MG content. Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and zeatin nucleoside (ZR) also increased first and then decreased, whereas the auxin (IAA) increased continuously. In HK301, all indices after spraying nicosulfuron were significantly greater than those of the control. In HK320, MG accumulation continued to increase after nicosulfuron spraying and GlyI and GlyII activities, and GSH first increased and then decreased after 1 day of stress. The indicators above were significantly greater than the control. The GSH/(GSH + GSSG) ratio showed a decreasing trend and was significantly smaller than the control. Furthermore, ABA and IAA continued to increase, and the GA and ZR first increased and then decreased. Compared with HK320, HK301 significantly upregulated the transcription levels of GlyI and GlyII genes in roots, stems, and leaves. Comprehensive analysis showed that sweet maize seedlings improved their herbicide resistance by changing the glyoxalase system and regulating endogenous hormones. The results provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the response mechanism of the glyoxalase system and the regulation characteristics of endogenous hormones in maize under nicosulfuron stress."
36775906,drought response,Transcriptome analysis of drought-responsive and drought-tolerant mechanisms in maize leaves under drought stress.,"Maize is a major crop essential for food and feed, but its production is threatened by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses, causing severe crop yield reduction. Although several studies have been devoted to selecting drought-tolerant maize lines and detecting the drought-responsive mechanism of maize, the transcriptomic differences between drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible maize lines are still largely unknown. In our study, RNA-seq was performed on leaves of the drought-tolerant line W9706 and the drought-susceptible line B73 after drought treatment. We identified 3147 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two lines. The up-regulated DEGs in W9706 were enriched in specific processes, including ABA signaling, wax biosynthesis, CHO metabolism, signal transduction and brassinosteroid biosynthesis-related processes, while the downregulated DEGs were enriched in specific processes, such as stomatal movement. Altogether, transcriptomic analysis suggests that the different drought resistances were correlated with the differential expression of genes, while the drought tolerance of W9706 is due to the more rapid response to stimulus, higher water retention capacity and stable cellular environment under water deficit conditions."
36843261,kernel development,Maize tubulin folding cofactor B is required for cell division and cell growth through modulating microtubule homeostasis.,"Tubulin folding cofactors (TFCs) are required for tubulin folding, α/β tubulin heterodimer formation, and microtubule (MT) dynamics in yeast and mammals. However, the functions of their plant counterparts remain to be characterized. We identified a natural maize crumpled kernel mutant, crk2, which exhibits reductions in endosperm cell number and size, as well as embryo/seedling lethality. Map-based cloning and functional complementation confirmed that ZmTFCB is causal for the mutation. ZmTFCB is targeted mainly to the cytosol. It facilitates α-tubulin folding and heterodimer formation through sequential interactions with the cytosolic chaperonin-containing TCP-1 ε subunit ZmCCT5 and ZmTFCE, thus affecting the organization of both the spindle and phragmoplast MT array and the cortical MT polymerization and array formation, which consequently mediated cell division and cell growth. We detected a physical association between ZmTFCB and the maize MT plus-end binding protein END-BINDING1 (ZmEB1), indicating that ZmTFCB1 may modulate MT dynamics by sequestering ZmEB1. Our data demonstrate that ZmTFCB is required for cell division and cell growth through modulating MT homeostasis, an evolutionarily conserved machinery with some species-specific divergence."
36844097,response to fall armyworm,Different responses of two maize cultivars to Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae infestation provide insights into their differences in resistance.,"Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a pest with an amazing appetite, damages many crops and causes great losses, especially maize. Understanding the differences in different maize cultivars' responses to S. frugiperda infestation is very important for revealing the mechanisms involved in the resistance of maize plants to S. frugiperda. In this study, a comparative analysis of two maize cultivars, the common cultivar 'ZD958' and the sweet cultivar 'JG218', was used to investigate their physico-biochemical responses to S. frugiperda infestation by a pot experiment. The results showed that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense responses of maize seedlings were rapidly induced by S. frugiperda. Frist, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of infested maize leaves were significantly increased and then decreased to the level of the control. Furthermore, compared with the control leaves, the puncture force values and the total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one contents of infested leaves were significantly increased within a certain time. The superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities of infested leaves were significantly increased in a certain period of time, while the catalase activities decreased significantly and then increased to the control level. The jasmonic acid (JA) levels of infested leaves were significantly improved, whereas the salicylic acid and abscisic acid levels changed less. Signaling genes associated with phytohormones and defensive substances including PAL4, CHS6, BX12, LOX1, and NCED9 were significantly induced at certain time points, especially LOX1. Most of these parameters changed greater in JG218 than in ZD958. Moreover, the larvae bioassay showed that S. frugiperda larvae weighed more on JG218 leaves than those on ZD958 leaves. These results suggested that JG218 was more susceptible to S. frugiperda than ZD958. Our findings will make it easier to develop strategies for controlling S. frugiperda for sustainable maize production and breeding of new maize cultivars with increased resistance to herbivores."
36853191,response to bacterial leaf streak,Exploring the relationship between pattern-triggered immunity and quantitative resistance to Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum in maize,"Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of maize is an emerging foliar disease of maize in the Americas. It is caused by the gram-negative non-vascular bacterium Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum (Xvv). There are no chemical controls available for BLS, and thus, host resistance is crucial for managing Xvv. The objective of this study was to examine the genetic determinants of resistance to Xvv in maize, as well as the relationship between other defense-related traits and BLS resistance. Specifically, we examined the correlations among BLS severity, severity for three fungal diseases, flg-22 response, hypersensitive response and auricle color. We conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for Xvv resistance using the maize recombinant inbred line population Z003 (B73 × CML228). We detected three QTL for BLS resistance. In addition to the disease resistance QTL, we detected a single QTL for auricle color. We observed significant, yet weak, correlations among BLS severity, levels of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) response and leaf flecking. These results will be useful for understanding resistance to Xvv and mitigating the impact of BLS on maize yields."
36864608,response to salt,MicroRNA408 negatively regulates salt tolerance by affecting secondary cell wall development in maize,"Although microRNA408 (miR408) is a highly conserved miRNA, the miR408 response to salt stress differs among plant species. Here, we show that miR408 transcripts are strongly repressed by salt stress and methyl viologen treatment in maize (Zea mays). Application of N, N1-dimethylthiourea partly relieved the NaCl-induced down-regulation of miR408. Transgenic maize overexpressing MIR408b is hypersensitive to salt stress. Overexpression of MIR408b enhanced the rate of net Na+ efflux, caused Na+ to locate in the inter-cellular space, reduced lignin accumulation, and reduced the number of cells in vascular bundles under salt stress. We further demonstrated that miR408 targets ZmLACCASE9 (ZmLAC9). Knockout of MIR408a or MIR408b or overexpression of ZmLAC9 increased the accumulation of lignin, thickened the walls of pavement cells, and improved salt tolerance of maize. Transcriptome profiles of the wild-type and MIR408b-overexpressing transgenic maize with or without salt stress indicated that miR408 negatively regulates the expression of cell wall biogenesis genes under salt conditions. These results indicate that miR408 negatively regulates salt tolerance by regulating secondary cell wall development in maize."
36866429,response to fall armyworm,Genes and genetic mechanisms contributing to fall armyworm resistance in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a crop of major economic and food security importance globally. The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, can devastate entire maize crops, especially in countries or markets that do not allow the use of transgenic crops. Host-plant insect resistance is an economical and environmentally benign way to control FAW, and this study sought to identify maize lines, genes, and pathways that contribute to resistance to FAW. Of the 289 maize lines phenotyped for FAW damage in artificially infested, replicated field trials over 3 years, 31 were identified with good levels of resistance that could donate FAW resistance into elite but susceptible hybrid parents. The 289 lines were genotyped by sequencing to provide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a metabolic pathway analysis using the Pathway Association Study Tool (PAST). GWAS identified 15 SNPs linked to 7 genes, and PAST identified multiple pathways, associated with FAW damage. Top pathways, and thus useful resistance mechanisms for further study, include hormone signaling pathways and the biosynthesis of carotenoids (particularly zeaxanthin), chlorophyll compounds, cuticular wax, known antibiosis agents, and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate. Targeted metabolite analysis confirmed that maize genotypes with lower levels of FAW damage tend to have higher levels of chlorophyll a than genotypes with high FAW damage, which tend to have lower levels of pheophytin, lutein, chlorophyll b and β-carotene. The list of resistant genotypes, and the results from the genetic, pathway, and metabolic study, can all contribute to efficient creation of FAW resistant cultivars."
36866706,kernel size,An ARF24-ZmArf2 Module Influences Kernel Size in Different Maize Haplotypes.,"Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor family, which are GTP-binding proteins, are involved in metabolite transport, cell division, and expansion. Although there has been a significant amount of research on small GTP-binding proteins, their roles and functions in regulating maize kernel size remain elusive. Here, we identified ZmArf2 as a maize ADP-ribosylation factor-like family member that is highly conserved during evolution. Maize zmarf2 mutants showed a characteristic smaller kernel size. Conversely, ZmArf2 overexpression increased maize kernel size. Furthermore, heterologous expression of ZmArf2 dramatically elevated Arabidopsis and yeast growth by promoting cell division. Using eQTL analysis, we determined that ZmArf2 expression levels in various lines were mainly associated with variation at the gene locus. The promoters of ZmArf2 genes could be divided into two types, pS and pL, that were significantly associated with both ZmArf2 expression levels and kernel size. In yeast one-hybrid screening, maize Auxin Response Factor 24 (ARF24) directly bound to the ZmArf2 promoter region and negatively regulated ZmArf2 expression. Notably, the pS and pL promoter types each contained an ARF24 binding element: an auxin response element (AuxRE) in pS and an auxin response region (AuxRR) in pL, respectively. ARF24 binding affinity to AuxRR was much higher compared to AuxRE. Overall, our results establish that the small G-protein ZmArf2 positively regulates maize kernel size and reveal the mechanism of its expression regulation."
36875585,Abiotic stress response,Identification of QTN-by-environment interactions for yield related traits in maize under multiple abiotic stresses.,"Quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN)-by-environment interactions (QEIs) play an increasingly essential role in the genetic dissection of complex traits in crops as global climate change accelerates. The abiotic stresses, such as drought and heat, are the major constraints on maize yields. Multi-environment joint analysis can improve statistical power in QTN and QEI detection, and further help us to understand the genetic basis and provide implications for maize improvement.In this study, 3VmrMLM was applied to identify QTNs and QEIs for three yield-related traits (grain yield, anthesis date, and anthesis-silking interval) of 300 tropical and subtropical maize inbred lines with 332,641 SNPs under well-watered and drought and heat stresses.Among the total 321 genes around 76 QTNs and 73 QEIs identified in this study, 34 known genes were reported in previous maize studies to be truly associated with these traits, such as ereb53 (GRMZM2G141638) and thx12 (GRMZM2G016649) associated with drought stress tolerance, and hsftf27 (GRMZM2G025685) and myb60 (GRMZM2G312419) associated with heat stress. In addition, among 127 homologs in Arabidopsis out of 287 unreported genes, 46 and 47 were found to be significantly and differentially expressed under drought vs well-watered treatments, and high vs. normal temperature treatments, respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis, 37 of these differentially expressed genes were involved in various biological processes. Tissue-specific expression and haplotype difference analysis further revealed 24 candidate genes with significantly phenotypic differences across gene haplotypes under different environments, of which the candidate genes GRMZM2G064159, GRMZM2G146192, and GRMZM2G114789 around QEIs may have gene-by-environment interactions for maize yield.All these findings may provide new insights for breeding in maize for yield-related traits adapted to abiotic stresses."
36875610,response to gibberellin,Effect of gibberellic acid on photosynthesis and oxidative stress response in maize under weak light conditions.,"Gibberellin (GA) is an important endogenous hormone involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Experiments were conducted at the Research and Education Center of Agronomy, Shenyang Agricultural University (Shenyang, China) in 2021.We used a pair of near-isogenic inbred maize lines comprising, SN98A (light-sensitive inbred line) and SN98B (light-insensitive inbred line) to study the effects of exogenous gibberellin A3 (GA3) application on different light-sensitive inbred lines under weak light conditions. The concentration of GA3 was selected as 20, 40 and 60 mg L-1. After shade treatment, the photosynthetic physiological indexes of SN98A were always lower than SN98B, and the net photosynthetic rate of SN98A was 10.12% lower than SN98B on the 20th day after shade treatment. GA3 treatments significantly reduced the barren stalk ratios in SN98A and improved its seed setting rates by increasing the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), photosynthetic pigment contents, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PS II) (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII), and antioxidant enzyme activities, where the most effective treatment was 60 mg L-1GA3. Compared with CK group, the seed setting rate increased by 33.87%. GA3 treatment also regulated the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced the superoxide anion ( O 2 -  ) production rate, H2O2 content, and malondialdehyde content. The superoxide anion ( O 2 -  ) production rate, H2O2 content and malondialdehyde content of SN98A sprayed with 60 mg L-1 GA3 decreased by 17.32%,10.44% and 50.33% compared with CK group, respectively. Compared with the control, GA3 treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased the expression levels of APX and GR in SN98A, and APX, Fe-SOD, and GR in SN98B. Weak light stress decreased the expression of GA20ox2, which was related to gibberellin synthesis, and the endogenous gibberellin synthesis of SN98A. Weak light stress accelerated leaf senescence, and exogenous GA3 application inhibited the ROS levels in the leaves and maintained normal physiological functions in the leaves. These results indicate that exogenous GA3 enhances the adaptability of plants to low light stress by regulating photosynthesis, ROS metabolism and protection mechanisms, as well as the expression of key genes, which may be an economical and environmentally friendly method to solve the low light stress problem in maize production."
36875617,mycorrhizal infection,Genome-wide analysis of 14-3-3 gene family in four gramineae and its response to mycorrhizal symbiosis in maize.,"14-3-3 proteins (regulatory protein family) are phosphate serine-binding proteins. A number of transcription factors and signaling proteins have been shown to bind to the 14-3-3 protein in plants, which plays a role in regulating their growth (seed dormancy, cell elongation and division, vegetative and reproduction growth and stress response (salt stress, drought stress, cold stress). Therefore, the 14-3-3 genes are crucial in controlling how plants respond to stress and develop. However, little is known about the function of 14-3-3 gene families in gramineae. In this study, 49 14-3-3 genes were identified from four gramineae, including maize, rice, sorghum and brachypodium, and their phylogeny, structure, collinearity and expression patterns of these genes were systematically analyzed. Genome synchronization analysis showed large-scale replication events of 14-3-3 genes in these gramineae plants. Moreover, gene expression revealed that the 14-3-3 genes respond to biotic and abiotic stresses differently in different tissues. Upon arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, the expression level of 14-3-3 genes in maize significantly increased, suggesting the important role of 14-3-3 genes in maize-AM symbiosis. Our results provide a better understanding on the occurrence of 14-3-3 genes in Gramineae plants, and several important candidate genes were found for futher study on AMF symbiotic regulation in maize."
36884355,plant height; response to plant population,Maize WRKY28 interacts with DELLA protein to affect skotomorphogenesis and participates in the regulation of shade avoidance and plant architecture.,"Competition for light from neighboring vegetation can trigger the shade avoidance response (SAR) in plants, which is detrimental to their yield. The molecular mechanisms regulating SAR are well established in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and some skotomorphogenesis regulators have been found to be involved in the regulation of the SAR and plant architecture. However, the role of WRKY transcription factors in this process is rarely reported, especially in maize (Zea mays L.). Here, we report that maize zmwrky28 mutants exhibited shorter mesocotyls in etiolated seedlings. Molecular and biochemical analyses demonstrated that ZmWRKY28 directly binds to the promoter region of a SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) gene ZmSAUR54 and a PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORPIF gene ZmPIF4.1 to activate their expression. In addition, the maize DELLA protein DWARF PLANT8 (D8) interacts with ZmWRKY28 in the nucleus to inhibit its transcriptional activation activity. Our results also showed that ZmWRKY28 participates in the regulation of the SAR, plant height, leaf rolling and erectness in maize. Taken together, these results reveal that ZmWRKY28 is involved in GA-mediated skotomorphogenic development and can be used as a potential target to regulate SAR for breeding of high-density-tolerant cultivars."
36891878,response to salt,Salt Tolerant Gene 1 contributes to salt tolerance by maintaining photosystem II activity in maize.,"Salt stress is a major environmental factor limiting crop growth and productivity. Here, we show that Salt-Tolerant Gene 1 (ZmSTG1) contributes to salt tolerance by maintaining photosystem activity in maize. ZmSTG1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum localized protein and retrotransposon insertion in the promoter region causes differential expression levels in maize inbred lines. Overexpression of ZmSTG1 improved plant growth vigor, and knockout of ZmSTG1 weakened plant growth under normal and salt stress conditions. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicated that ZmSTG1 might regulate the expression of lipid trafficking-related genes dependent on the ABA signalling pathway, thereby increasing the galactolipids and phospholipid concentrations in the photosynthetic membrane under salt stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters showed that the knockout of ZmSTG1 led to significant impairment of plant photosystem II (PSII) activity under normal and salt stress conditions, whereas overexpression of ZmSTG1 dramatically improved plant PSII activity under salt stress conditions. We also demonstrated that the application of the salt-tolerant locus could enhance salt tolerance in hybrid maize plants. Taken together, we propose that ZmSTG1 may modulate the lipid composition in the photosynthetic membrane by affecting the expression of lipid trafficking-related genes to maintain the photosynthetic activity of plants under salt stress."
36894953,kernel type,Corn360: a method for quantification of corn kernels,"Background: The rapidly advancing corn breeding field calls for high-throughput methods to phenotype corn kernel traits to estimate yield and to study their genetic inheritance. Most of the existing methods are reliant on sophisticated setup, expertise in statistical models and programming skills for image capturing and analysis. Results: We demonstrated a portable, easily accessible, affordable, panoramic imaging capturing system called Corn360, followed by image analysis using freely available software, to characterize total kernel count and different patterned kernel counts of a corn ear. The software we used did not require programming skills and utilized Artificial Intelligence to train a model and to segment the images of mixed patterned corn ears. For homogeneously patterned corn ears, our results showed accuracies of 93.7% of total kernel count compared to manual counting. Our method allowed to save an average of 3 min 40 s per image. For mixed patterned corn ears, our results showed accuracies of 84.8% or 61.8% of segmented kernel counts. Our method has the potential to greatly decrease counting time per image as the number of images increases. We also demonstrated a case of using Corn360 to count different categories of kernels on a mixed patterned corn ear resulting from a cross of sweet corn and sticky corn and showed that starch:sweet:sticky segregated in a 9:4:3 ratio in its F2 population. Conclusions: The panoramic Corn360 approach enables for a portable low-cost high-throughput kernel quantification. This includes total kernel quantification and quantification of different patterned kernels. This can allow for quick estimate of yield component and for categorization of different patterned kernels to study the inheritance of genes controlling color and texture. We demonstrated that using the samples resulting from a sweet × sticky cross, the starchiness, sweetness and stickiness in this case were controlled by two genes with epistatic effects. Our achieved results indicate Corn360 can be used to effectively quantify corn kernels in a portable and cost-efficient way that is easily accessible with or without programming skills."
36905845,response to sulfur dioxide exposure; response to heat stress,Sulfur dioxide improves the thermotolerance of maize seedlings by regulating salicylic acid biosynthesis.,"Heat stress (HS) has become a serious threat to crop growth and yield. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is being verified as a signal molecule in regulating the plant stress response. However, it is unknown whether SO2 plays a significant role in the plant heat stress response (HSR). Herein, maize seedlings were pretreated with various concentrations of SO2 and then kept at 45 °C for heat stress treatment, aiming to study the effect of SO2 pretreatment on HSR in maize by phenotypic, physiological, and biochemical analyses. It was found that SO2 pretreatment greatly improved the thermotolerance of maize seedlings. The SO2-pretreated seedlings showed 30-40% lower ROS accumulation and membrane peroxidation, but 55-110% higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than the distilled water-pretreated seedlings under heat stress. Interestingly, endogenous salicylic acid (SA) levels were increased by ∼85% in SO2-pretreated seedlings, as revealed by phytohormone analyses. Furthermore, the SA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol markedly reduced SA levels and attenuated SO2-triggered thermotolerance of maize seedlings. Meanwhile, transcripts of several SA biosynthesis and signaling, and heat stress-responsive genes in SO2-pretreated seedlings were significantly elevated under HS. These data have demonstrated that SO2 pretreatment increased endogenous SA levels, which activated the antioxidant machinery and strengthened the stress defense system, thereby improving the thermotolerance of maize seedlings under HS. Our current study provides a new strategy for mitigating heat stress damage for safe crop production."
36925963,Anthocyanin content,"Integrated metabolite analysis and health-relevant in vitro functionality of white, red, and orange maize (Zea mays L.) from the Peruvian Andean race Cabanita at different maturity stages.","The high maize (Zea mays L.) diversity in Peru has been recognized worldwide, but the investigation focused on its integral health-relevant and bioactive characterization is limited. Therefore, this research aimed at studying the variability of the primary and the secondary (free and dietary fiber-bound phenolic, and carotenoid compounds) metabolites of three maize types (white, red, and orange) from the Peruvian Andean race Cabanita at different maturity stages (milk-S1, dough-S2, and mature-S3) using targeted and untargeted methods. In addition, their antioxidant potential, and α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities relevant for hyperglycemia management were investigated using in vitro models. Results revealed a high effect of the maize type and the maturity stage. All maize types had hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids in their free phenolic fractions, whereas major bound phenolic compounds were ferulic acid, ferulic acid derivatives, and p-coumaric acid. Flavonoids such as luteolin derivatives and anthocyanins were specific in the orange and red maize, respectively. The orange and red groups showed higher phenolic ranges (free + bound) (223.9-274.4 mg/100 g DW, 193.4- 229.8 mg/100 g DW for the orange and red maize, respectively) than the white maize (162.2-225.0 mg/100 g DW). Xanthophylls (lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, and a lutein isomer) were detected in all maize types. However, the orange maize showed the highest total carotenoid contents (3.19-5.87 μg/g DW). Most phenolic and carotenoid compounds decreased with kernel maturity in all cases. In relation to the primary metabolites, all maize types had similar fatty acid contents (linoleic acid > oleic acid > palmitic acid > α-linolenic acid > stearic acid) which increased with kernel development. Simple sugars, alcohols, amino acids, free fatty acids, organic acids, amines, and phytosterols declined along with grain maturity and were overall more abundant in white maize at S1. The in vitro functionality was similar among Cabanita maize types, but it decreased with the grain development, and showed a high correlation with the hydrophilic free phenolic fraction. Current results suggest that the nutraceutical characteristics of orange and white Cabanita maize are better at S1 and S2 stages while the red maize would be more beneficial at S3."
36931522,cadmium content,Nitrate_dependent suberization regulates cadmium uptake and accumulation in maize.,"In this study, effect of nitrate-dependent suberization in maize root on cadmium (Cd) uptake and accumulation was investigated. Suberization in maize roots was significantly lower in plants grown with a high nitrate supply compared with low nitrate. This decrease was seen in the total amount of suberin, in which the aliphatic suberin amount was significantly decreased, whereas no difference in aromatic suberin content between different N-treatments. RNA-sequencing showed that suberin biosynthesis genes were upregulated in low nitrate treatment, which correlated well with the increased suberin content. Bioimaging and xylem sap analysis showed that reduced exodermal and endodermal suberization in roots of plants grown under high nitrate promoted radial Cd transport along the crown root. The enhanced suberization in crown roots of plants grown in low nitrate restricted the radial transport of Cd from epidermis to cortex via decreased accessibility to Cd related transporters at the plasmalemma. Also, under low nitrate supply, the Cd transport gene ZmNramp5 was upregulated in the crown root, which may enhance Cd uptake by root tip where exodermis and endodermis were not fully suberized. These results suggest that high nitrate supply enhances Cd uptake and radial transport in maize roots by reducing exodermal and endodermal suberization."
36935928,drought response,Cloning and comparative modeling identifies a highly stress tolerant Cu/Zn cytosolic super oxide dismutase 2 from a drought tolerant maize inbred line.,"Plants have a complex system of stress response that deals with different types of stresses. Maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most important crops grown throughout the world, across a range of agro-ecological environments, employs complex mechanisms of gene regulation in response to drought stress. HKI 335 is a tropical maize inbred line showing remarkable adaptation to drought stress. Abiotic stresses, like drought, trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the incomplete reduction or excitation of molecular oxygen, eventually leading to cell damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is a metalloenzyme that acts as the first line of defense against ROS. We cloned the Sod2 gene from HKI 335 inbred line and analyzed its protein through detailed in silico characterization. Our comparative modeling revealed that at the level of tertiary structure, the HKI 335 SOD2 protein is highly similar to Potentilla atrosanguinea SOD2, which had been previously identified as highly thermostable SOD that can tolerate autoclaving as well as sub-zero temperatures. We performed phylogenetic analysis, estimated physicochemical properties, post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and domain composition of this SOD2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that orthologous sequences of SOD from different species were clustered into two clusters. Secondary structure prediction indicates that SOD2 is a soluble protein and no transmembrane domains have been found. Most of the beta sheets have RSA value greater than 2. The Ramachandran plot from PDBsum revealed that most of the residues fall in the highly favored region. It was estimated that the value of the instability index was less than 40, the value of the aliphatic index was extremely high and the GRAVY value lies between -2 and +2. We could identify only one phosphorylation site, located at position 20 with a score of 0.692. Overall, the unique stress-tolerant properties of the HKI 335 SOD2, may be one of the reasons contributing to the high drought tolerance trait exhibited by HKI 335 maize inbred line. Further research may reveal more insights into the drought adaptation mechanism in maize and the eventual deployment of the trait in maize hybrids."
36938972,response to Fusarium stalk rot,Integrative transcriptome and proteome analysis reveals maize responses to Fusarium verticillioides infection inside the stalks.,"Fusarium stalk rot caused by Fusarium verticillioides is one of the most devastating diseases of maize that causes significant yield losses and poses potential security concerns for foods worldwide. The underlying mechanisms of maize plants regulating defence against the disease remain poorly understood. Here, integrative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were employed to identify pathogenesis-related protein genes by comparing differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in maize stalks after inoculation with F. verticillioides. Functional enrichment analysis showed that DEGs and DEPs were mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Fourteen DEGs and DEGs that were highly elevated after inoculation with F. verticillioides were confirmed with parallel reaction monitoring and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, demonstrating the accountability and reliability of proteomic and transcriptomic data. We also assessed the potential roles of defence-related genes ZmCTA1, ZmWIP1, and ZmLOX2, identified from the multi-omics analysis, during the process of F. verticillioides infection through virus-induced gene silencing. The elevation of stalk rot symptomatic characteristics in the silenced plants revealed their contribution to resistance. We further functionally characterized the roles of ZmLOX2 expression in the defence response of maize plants conditioning fungal invasion via the salicylic acid-dependent pathway. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome and proteome of maize stalks following F. verticillioides inoculation, and defence-related genes that could inform selection of new genes as targets in breeding strategies."
36964601,temperate adaptation,A role for heritable transcriptomic variation in maize adaptation to temperate environments.,"Background: Transcription bridges genetic information and phenotypes. Here, we evaluated how changes in transcriptional regulation enable maize (Zea mays), a crop originally domesticated in the tropics, to adapt to temperate environments. Result: We generated 572 unique RNA-seq datasets from the roots of 340 maize genotypes. Genes involved in core processes such as cell division, chromosome organization and cytoskeleton organization showed lower heritability of gene expression, while genes involved in anti-oxidation activity exhibited higher expression heritability. An expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS) identified 19,602 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of 11,444 genes. A GWAS for alternative splicing identified 49,897 splicing QTLs (sQTLs) for 7614 genes. Genes harboring both cis-eQTLs and cis-sQTLs in linkage disequilibrium were disproportionately likely to encode transcription factors or were annotated as responding to one or more stresses. Independent component analysis of gene expression data identified loci regulating co-expression modules involved in oxidation reduction, response to water deprivation, plastid biogenesis, protein biogenesis, and plant-pathogen interaction. Several genes involved in cell proliferation, flower development, DNA replication, and gene silencing showed lower gene expression variation explained by genetic factors between temperate and tropical maize lines. A GWAS of 27 previously published phenotypes identified several candidate genes overlapping with genomic intervals showing signatures of selection during adaptation to temperate environments. Conclusion: Our results illustrate how maize transcriptional regulatory networks enable changes in transcriptional regulation to adapt to temperate regions."
36964900,response to corn leaf aphid,Combining QTL mapping with multiomics profiling reveals genetic control of corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) resistance in maize.,"Corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) is a major maize pest, frequently causing substantial yield losses. Exploring the genetic basis of aphid resistance is important for improving maize yield and quality. Here, we used a maize recombinant inbred line population derived from two parents with different susceptibility to aphids, B73 (susceptible) and Abe2 (resistant), and performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using aphid resistance scores as an indicator. We mapped a stable QTL, qRTA6, to chromosome 6 using data from two years' field trials, which explained 40.12%-55.17% of the phenotypic variation. To further investigate the mechanism of aphid resistance in Abe2, we constructed transcriptome and metabolome libraries from Abe2 and B73 leaves with or without aphid infestation at different time points (0, 6 and 24h). Integrating QTL mapping and transcriptome data revealed three aphid resistance candidate genes (Zm00001d035736, Zm00001d035751, and Zm00001d035767) associated with the hypersensitive response, the jasmonic acid pathway and protein ubiquitination. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes and metabolites were enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling aphid resistance, and the QTL and candidate genes are valuable resources for increasing aphid resistance in maize. Highlight:
Multiomics analysis revealed that the upregulation of phytohormones, transcription factors,
benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenoid biosynthetic genes, and the induced accumulation of
flavonoid metabolites, correlate with aphid resistance in maize variety Abe2."
36968417,response to cold stress,ZmG6PDH1 in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase family enhances cold stress tolerance in maize.,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway responsible for the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), thereby playing a central role in facilitating cellular responses to stress and maintaining redox homeostasis. This study aimed to characterize five G6PDH gene family members in maize. The classification of these ZmG6PDHs into plastidic and cytosolic isoforms was enabled by phylogenetic and transit peptide predictive analyses and confirmed by subcellular localization imaging analyses using maize mesophyll protoplasts. These ZmG6PDH genes exhibited distinctive expression patterns across tissues and developmental stages. Exposure to stressors, including cold, osmotic stress, salinity, and alkaline conditions, also significantly affected the expression and activity of the ZmG6PDHs, with particularly high expression of a cytosolic isoform (ZmG6PDH1) in response to cold stress and closely correlated with G6PDH enzymatic activity, suggesting that it may play a central role in shaping responses to cold conditions. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ZmG6PDH1 on the B73 background led to enhanced cold stress sensitivity. Significant changes in the redox status of the NADPH, ascorbic acid (ASA), and glutathione (GSH) pools were observed after exposure of the zmg6pdh1 mutants to cold stress, with this disrupted redox balance contributing to increased production of reactive oxygen species and resultant cellular damage and death. Overall, these results highlight the importance of cytosolic ZmG6PDH1 in supporting maize resistance to cold stress, at least in part by producing NADPH that can be used by the ASA-GSH cycle to mitigate cold-induced oxidative damage."
36974884,root lodging,The 2020 derecho revealed limited overlap between maize genes associated with root lodging and root system architecture.,"Roots anchor plants in soil, and the failure of anchorage (i.e., root lodging) is a major cause of crop yield loss. Anchorage is often assumed to be driven by root system architecture. We made use of a natural experiment to measure the overlap between the genetic regulation of root system architecture and anchorage. After one of the most devastating derechos ever recorded in August 2020, we phenotyped root lodging in a maize (Zea mays) diversity panel consisting of 369 genotypes grown in six environments affected by the derecho. Genome-wide association studies and transcriptome-wide association studies identified 118 candidate genes associated with root lodging. Thirty-four percent (40/118) of these were homologs of genes from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that affect traits such as root morphology and lignin content, expected to affect root lodging. Finally, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the candidate genes and their predicted interaction partners at the transcriptional and translational levels revealed the complex regulatory networks of physiological and biochemical pathways underlying root lodging in maize. Limited overlap between genes associated with lodging resistance and root system architecture in this diversity panel suggests that anchorage depends in part on factors other than gross characteristics of root system architecture."
36981006,response to fall armyworm,Coronatine-Based Gene Expression Changes Impart Partial Resistance to Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Seedling Maize.,"In recent years, Spodoptera frugiperda (S. frugiperda, Smith) has invaded China, seriously threatening maize production. To explore an effective method to curb the further expansion of the harm of the S. frugiperda, this experiment used maize seedlings of the Zhengdan 958 three-leaf stage (V3) of maize as the material to study the effect of coronatine (COR) on the ability of maize to resist insects (S. frugiperda) at the seedling stage. The results showed that when maize was sprayed with 0.05 μM COR, the newly incubated larvae of S. frugiperda had the least leaf feeding. It was found that 0.05 μM COR significantly increased the contents of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonate (JA) in maize leaves through the determination of hormone content. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing revealed that the expression of six genes (ZmBX1, ZmBX2, ZmBX3, ZmBX4, ZmBX5 and ZmBX6), which are associated with the synthesis of benzoxazinoid, were upregulated. Nine genes (ZmZIM3, ZmZIM4, ZmZIM10, ZmZIM13, ZmZIM18, ZmZIM23, ZmZIM27, ZmZIM28 and ZmZIM38) of JA-Zim Domain (JAZ) protein in the JA signal pathway, and seven genes (ZmPRH19, ZmPRH18, Zm00001d024732, Zm00001d034109, Zm00001d026269, Zm00001d028574 and Zm00001d013220) of ABA downstream response protein Group A Type 2C Protein Phosphatase (PP2C) were downregulated. These results demonstrated that COR could induce anti-insect factors and significantly improve insect resistance in seedling maize, which laid a theoretical foundation for further study of the mechanism of COR improving insect resistance in seedling maize, and provided data references for the use of COR as an environmentally friendly pest control method."
36999611,seed vigor,Maize PIMT2 repairs the damaged 3-METHYLCROTONYL COA CARBOXYLASE in mitochondria controlling seed vigor.,"PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT) regulates seed vigor by repairing damaged proteins. While capable of isoaspartyl repair in all proteins, those proteins most susceptible to isoAsp formation have not been well characterized and the mechanisms of PIMT regulation of seed vigor remains largely unknown. Using Co-IP and LC-MS/MS, maize (Zea mays) PIMT2 (ZmPIMT2) interacted predominantly with both subunits of maize 3-METHYLCROTONYL COA CARBOXYLASE (ZmMCC). ZmPIMT2 is specifically expressed in maize embryo. Both mRNA and protein accumulation of ZmPIMT2 increased during seed maturation and declined during imbibition. Maize seed vigor was decreased in the zmpimt2 mutant line while overexpression of ZmPIMT2 in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana increased seed vigor upon artificial aging. ZmPIMT2 was localized in the mitochondria, as determined by subcellular localization assays in maize protoplast. ZmPIMT2 binding to ZmMCCα was confirmed by luciferase complementation tests in both tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves and maize protoplasts. Knock down of ZmMCCα decreased maize seed aging tolerance. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmPIMT2 decreased the accumulation of isoAsp of ZmMCCα protein in seed embryos that were treated with accelerated aging. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ZmPIMT2 binds ZmMCCα in mitochondria, repairing isoAsp damage, and positively regulates maize seed vigor."
37010681,response to nicosulfuron,Effect of nicosulfuron on dynamic changes in the starch-sugar interconversion in sweet maize (Zea mays L.).,"Starch is an important reserve of sugar, and starch-sugar conversion in plants plays an important role in the response of plants to various abiotic stresses. Nicosulfuron is a post-emergence herbicide commonly applied to maize fields. However, it is unclear how sucrose and starch in sweet corn are converted to accommodate nicosulfuron stress. Field and pot experiments were conducted to study the effects of nicosulfuron on the sugar metabolism enzymes, starch metabolism enzymes, non-enzyme substances, and expression of key enzyme genes in leaves and roots of sweet maize seedlings. Accordingly, this research compared the responses of the sister lines HK301 and HK320, which are nicosulfuron tolerant and sensitive, respectively. Under nicosulfuron stress, compared with HK301 seedlings, the accumulation of stem and root dry matter of HK320 seedlings was significantly reduced, resulting in a lower root-to-shoot ratio. Compared with HK320 seedlings, nicosulfuron stress significantly increased the sucrose, soluble sugar, and starch contents in HK301 leaves and roots. This may be related to the enhanced carbohydrate metabolism under nicosulfuron stress, including significant changes in sugar metabolism enzyme activity and the levels of SPS and SuSys expression. Further, under nicosulfuron stress, sucrose transporter genes (SUC 1, SUC 2, SWEET 13a, and SWEET 13b) in the leaves and roots of HK301 seedlings were significantly upregulated. Our results emphasize that changes in sugar distribution, metabolism, and transport can improve the adaptability of sweet maize to nicosulfuron stress."
37018076,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,Activated malate circulation contributes to the manifestation of light-dependent mosaic symptoms,"Mosaic symptoms are commonly observed in virus-infected plants. However, the underlying mechanism by which viruses cause mosaic symptoms as well as the key regulator(s) involved in this process remain unclear. Here, we investigate maize dwarf mosaic disease caused by sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). We find that the manifestation of mosaic symptoms in SCMV-infected maize plants requires light illumination and is correlated with mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (mROS) accumulation. The transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses results together with the genetic and cytopathological evidence indicate that malate and malate circulation pathways play essential roles in promoting mosaic symptom development. Specifically, at the pre-symptomatic infection stage or infection front, SCMV infection elevates the enzymatic activity of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase by decreasing the phosphorylation of threonine527 under light, resulting in malate overproduction and subsequent mROS accumulation. Our findings indicate that activated malate circulation contributes to the manifestation of light-dependent mosaic symptoms via mROS."
37019418,response to maize Iranian mosaic virus infection,Gene network modeling and pathway analysis of maize transcriptomes in response to Maize Iranian mosaic virus.,"Maize Iranian mosaic virus (MIMV, family Rhabdoviridae) is one of the factors limiting cereal production in Iran. In the present study, we sought to find critical genes and key pathways involved in MIMV infection and analyzed gene networks, pathways and promoters using transcriptome data. We determined the hub genes involved in pathways related to the proteasome and ubiquitin. The results showed the important role of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum in MIMV infection. Network cluster analysis confirmed the result of GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The discovered miRNAs belonged to miR166, miR167, miR169, miR395, miR399, miR408 and miR482 families, which are involved in various pathogenicity or resistance processes against MIMV or other viruses. The results of this study provide a list of hub genes, important pathways and new insights for the future development of virus-resistant transgenic crops and clarify the basic mechanism of plant response."
37030327,days to flowering,ZmGI2 regulates flowering time through multiple flower development pathways in maize.,"GIGANTEA (GI) encodes a component of the circadian clock core oscillator and has been identified as a regulatory pathway of the circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering in model plants. However, the regulatory pathway of GI affecting flowering time is unknown in maize. Here, we identified that the zmgi2 mutant flowered earlier than the wild type under long day (LD) conditions, whereas the difference in flowering time was not apparent under short day (SD) conditions. The 24h optimal expression of the gene in the stem apex meristems (SAM) appeared at 9h after dawn under LD conditions and at 11h after dawn under SD conditions. DAP-Seq and RNA-Seq further revealed that ZmGI2 delays flowering by directly binding to the upstream regions of ZmVOZs, ZmZCN8 and ZmFPF1 to repress the expression of these genes and by directly binding to the upstream regions of ZmARR11, ZmDOF and ZmUBC11 to promote the expression of these genes. The genetic and biochemical evidence suggests a model for the potential role of ZmGI2 in regulating the flowering time-dependent photoperiodic pathway. This study provides novel insights into the function of ZmGIs in maize and further demonstrates their potential importance for floral transition. These results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of GI transcription factors in regulating flowering time in maize."
37036421,response to foxtail mosaic virus,Foxtail mosaic virus: A tool for gene function analysis in maize and other monocots.,"Many plant viruses have been engineered into vectors for use in functional genomics studies, expression of heterologous proteins, and, most recently, gene editing applications. The use of viral vectors overcomes bottlenecks associated with mutagenesis and transgenesis approaches often implemented for analysis of gene function. There are several engineered viruses that are demonstrated or suggested to be useful in maize through proof-of-concept studies. However, foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV), which has a relatively broad host range, is emerging as a particularly useful virus for gene function studies in maize and other monocot crop or weed species. A few clones of FoMV have been independently engineered, and they have different features and capabilities for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) of proteins. In addition, FoMV can be used to deliver functional guide RNAs in maize and other plants expressing the Cas9 protein, demonstrating its potential utility in virus-induced gene editing applications. There is a growing number of studies in which FoMV vectors are being applied for VIGS or VOX in maize and the vast majority of these are related to maize-microbe interactions. In this review, we highlight the biology and engineering of FoMV as well as its applications in maize-microbe interactions and more broadly in the context of the monocot functional genomics toolbox."
37040571,nitrogen uptake; root cortical cell file number,Large root cortical cells and reduced cortical cell files improve growth under suboptimal nitrogen in silico.,"Suboptimal nitrogen availability is a primary constraint to plant growth. We used OpenSimRoot, a functional-structural plant/soil model, to test the hypothesis that larger root cortical cell size (CCS), reduced cortical cell file number (CCFN), and their interactions with root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) and lateral root branching density (LRBD) are useful adaptations to suboptimal soil nitrogen availability in maize (Zea mays). Reduced CCFN increased shoot dry weight over 80%. Reduced respiration, reduced nitrogen content, and reduced root diameter accounted for 23%, 20%, and 33% of increased shoot biomass, respectively. Large CCS increased shoot biomass by 24% compared with small CCS. When simulated independently, reduced respiration and reduced nutrient content increased the shoot biomass by 14% and 3%, respectively. However, increased root diameter resulting from large CCS decreased shoot biomass by 4% due to an increase in root metabolic cost. Under moderate N stress, integrated phenotypes with reduced CCFN, large CCS, and high RCA improved shoot biomass in silt loam and loamy sand soils. In contrast, integrated phenotypes composed of reduced CCFN, large CCS and reduced lateral root branching density had the greatest growth in silt loam, while phenotypes with reduced CCFN, large CCS and high LRBD were the best performers in loamy sands. Our results support the hypothesis that larger CCS, reduced CCFN, and their interactions with RCA and LRBD could increase nitrogen acquisition by reducing root respiration and root nutrient demand. Phene synergisms may exist between CCS, CCFN, and LRBD. CCS and CCFN merit consideration for breeding cereal crops with improved nitrogen acquisition, which is critical for global food security."
37043497,kernel row number,Designed and validated novel allele-specific primer to differentiate Kernel Row Number (KRN) in tropical field corn,"Background: Kernel row number (KRN) is an important yield component trait with a direct impact on the productivity of maize. The variability in KRN is influenced by the inflorescence meristem size, which is determined by the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway. A CLAVATA receptor-like protein, encoded by the FASCIATED EAR2 (fea2gene), enhances the growth of inflorescence meristem and is thus involved in the determination of KRN. The amplicon sequencing-based method was employed to dissect the allelic variation of the fea2 gene in tropical field corn. 
Methodology/Principal finding: Amplicon-based sequencing of AI 535 (Low KRN) and AI 536 (High KRN) was undertaken for the gene fea 2 gene that codes for KRN in maize. Upon multiple sequence alignment of both sequences, A to T transversion at the 1311 position was noticed between Low KRN and High KRN genotypes resulting in different allelic forms of a fea2 gene in tropical maize. An allele-specific primer 1311 fea2.1 was designed and validated that can differentiate High and Low KRN genotypes. 
Conclusion/Significance: Maize has high variability for KRN and is exemplified by the wide values ranging from 8–26 KRN in the maize germpalsm. The sequence-based approach of SNP detection through the use of a specific primer facilitated the detection of variation present in the target trait. This makes it possible to capture these variations in the early generation. In the study, the PCR-based differentiation method described for the identification of desirable high KRN genotypes would augment the breeding programs for improving the productivity of field corn."
37046216,kernel color,Metabolomics and transcriptomics strategies to reveal the mechanism of diversity of maize kernel color and quality.,"Background: Maize has many kernel colors, from white to dark black. However, research on the color and nutritional quality of the different varieties is limited. The color of the maize grain is an important characteristic. Colored maize is rich in nutrients, which have received attention for their role in diet-related chronic diseases and have different degrees of anti-stress protection for animal and human health. Methods: A comprehensive metabolome (LC-MS/MS) and transcriptome analysis was performed in this study to compare different colored maize varieties from the perspective of multiple recombination in order to study the nutritional value of maize with different colors and the molecular mechanism of color formation. Results: Maize kernels with diverse colors contain different types of health-promoting compounds, highlighting that different maize varieties can be used as functional foods according to human needs. Among them, red-purple and purple-black maize contain more flavonoids than white and yellow kernels. Purple-black kernels have a high content of amino acids and nucleotides, while red-purple kernels significantly accumulate sugar alcohols and lipids. Conclusion: Our study can provide insights for improving people's diets and provide a theoretical basis for the study of food structure for chronic diseases."
37052178,root morphology,Natural variation of maize root hydraulic architecture underlies highly diverse water uptake capacities,"Plant water uptake is determined by the root system architecture and its hydraulic capacity, which together define the root hydraulic architecture. The current research aims at understanding the water uptake capacities of maize (Zea mays), a model organism and major crop. We explored the genetic variations within a collection of 224 maize inbred Dent lines and successively defined core genotype subsets to access multiple architectural, anatomical, and hydraulic parameters in the primary root (PR) and seminal roots (SR) of hydroponically grown seedlings. We found 9-fold, 3.5-fold and 12.4-fold genotypic differences for root hydraulics (Lpr), PR size, and lateral root (LR) size, respectively, that shaped wide and independent variations of root structure and function. Within genotypes, PR and SR showed similarities in hydraulics and, to a lesser extent, in anatomy. They had comparable aquaporin activity profiles that, however, could not be explained by aquaporin expression levels. Genotypic variations in the size and number of late meta xylem vessels were positively correlated with Lpr. Inverse modeling further revealed dramatic genotypic differences in the xylem conductance profile. Thus, tremendous natural variation of maize root hydraulic architecture underlies a high diversity of water uptake strategies and paves the way to quantitative genetic dissection of its elementary traits."
37052727,"starch content, kernel",Overexpression of the ZmSUS1 gene alters the content and composition of endosperm starch in maize (Zea mays L.),"Cereal crops accumulate starch in seeds as an energy reserve. Sucrose Synthase (SuSy) plays an important role in grain starch synthesis. In this study, ZmSUS1 was transformed into maize inbred line KN5585, and transgenic plants were obtained. Compared with the non-transgenic negative control, the content and activity of SuSy were significantly increased, the amylose content in mature seeds of transgenic maize increased by 41.1–69.2%, the total starch content increased by 5.0–13.5%, the 100-grain weight increased by 19.0–26.2% and the average diameter of starch granules increased by 10.8–17.2%. These results indicated that overexpression of ZmSUS1 can significantly improve the traits of maize seeds and obtain new lines with high amylose content. It was also found that the overexpression of ZmSUS1 may increase the amylose content by altering the expression of endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) subunits Shrunken2 (Sh2) and Brittle2 (Bt2). Moreover, the ectopic expression of ZmSUS1 also affected the expression of Granule bound starch synthase1 (GBSS1) and Starch synthase1 (SS1) which encode starch synthase. This study proved the important role of ZmSUS1 in maize starch synthesis and provided a new technology strategy for improving maize starch content and yield. Main conclusion: ZmSUS1 increases the amylose content of maize by regulating the expression of Shrunken2 (Sh2) and Brittle2 (Bt2) which encode the size subunits of endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and Granule bound starchsynthase1 (GBSS1) and Starch synthase1 (SS1)."
37060869,response to heavy metals,microRNAomic profiling of maize root reveals multifaceted mechanisms to cope with Cr (VI) stress.,"Chromium (Cr) contamination of soil and water poses serious threats to agricultural crop production. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, non-coding small RNAs that play pivotal roles in plant growth, development and stress responses through fine-tuning of post-transcriptional gene expression. To better understand the molecular circuit of Cr-responsive miRNAs, two sRNA libraries were prepared from control and Cr (VI) [100 ppm] exposed maize roots. Using deep sequencing, we identified 80 known (1 up and 79 down) and 18 downregulated novel miRNAs from Cr (VI) challenged roots. Gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that predicted target genes of Cr (VI) responsive miRNAs are potentially involved in diverse cellular and biological processes including plant growth and development (miR159c, miR164d, miR319b-3p and zma_25.145), redox homeostasis (miR528-5p, miR396a-5p and zma_9.132), heavy metal uptake and detoxification (miR159f-5p, 164e-5p, miR408a, miR444f and zma_2.127), signal transduction (miR159f, miR160a-5p, miR393a-5p, miR408-5p and zma_43.158), cell signalling (miR156j, 159c-5p, miR166c-5p and miR398b). Higher accumulation of Cr in maize roots might be due to upregulation of ABC transporter G family member 29 targeted by miR444f. Instead of isolated increase in SOD expression, significant decline in GSH:GSSH ratio and histochemical staining strongly suggest Cr (VI) stress mediated disruption of ROS scavenging machinery thus unbalancing normal cellular homeostasis. Moreover, miR159c-mediated enhanced expression of GAMYB might be a reason for impaired root growth under Cr (VI) stress. In a nutshell, the present microRNAomic study sheds light on the miRNA-target gene regulatory network involved in adaptive responses of maize seedlings to Cr (VI) stress."
37061865,kernel row number,Divergent selection of KNR6 maximizes grain production by balancing the flowering-time adaptation and ear size in maize.,"We estimated the effects of KNR6 and four known flowering genes, ZmCCT9, ZmCCT10, VGT1 and ZCN8, on flowering time and ear length in a diverse maize population containing 508 maize inbreds. As expected, all genes had strong effects on flowering time, and only KNR6 had a trade-off effect on ear length (Figure S3). Notably, the early-flowering allele of VGT1 still promoted flowering by 2.1 days when the early flowering alleles of ZmCCT9 and ZmCCT10 were fixed in the lines with long-ear/late-flowering KNR6TE− allele of KNR6 (Figure S4). Moreover, the early-flowering alleles of VGT1, ZmCCT9 and ZmCCT10 were not fixed in modern inbreds (Figure S5). Thus, we proposed an operational strategy, as shown in two aforementioned Chinese germplasms, to improve grain yield of the lines by replacing the short-ear/early-flowering KNR6TE+ allele with the long-ear/late-flowering KNR6TE− allele of KNR6 and balancing the late-flowering effect by pyramiding the early-flowering alleles of ZmCCT9, ZmCCT10, VGT1 and other flowering-time genes via marker-assisted selection (Figure 1o). Collectively, we found that KNR6 underwent divergent selection during maize breeding to extend adaptation and increase grain yield, and offered a knowledge-driven strategy for engineering KNR6 to maximize maize grain production."
37062384,response to seed aging,Integration of miRNA and mRNA analysis reveals the role of ribosome in to anti-artificial aging in sweetcorn.,"Sweetcorn is a kind of maize with high sugar content and has poor seed aging tolerance, which seriously limits its production. However, few studies have explored the artificial aging (AA) tolerance by miRNA-mRNA integration analysis in sweetcorn. Here, we characterized the physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic changes of two contrasting lines K62 and K107 treated with AA during time series. Both the germination indexes and antioxidant enzymes showed significant difference between two lines. The MDA content of AA-tolerant genotype K62 was significantly lower than that of K107 on the fourth and sixth day. Subsequently, 157 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs) and 8878 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) were identified by RNA-seq analysis under aging stress. The ""ribosome"" and ""peroxisome"" pathways were enriched to respond to aging stress, genes for both large units and small ribosomal subunits were significantly upregulated expressed and higher translation efficiency might exist in K62. Thirteen pairs of miRNA-target genes were obtained, and 8 miRNA-mRNA pairs might involve in ribosome protein and translation process. Our results elucidate the mechanism of sweetcorn response to AA at miRNA-mRNA level, and provide a new insight into sweetcorn AA response to stress."
37068119,leaf development,Mutations in NAKED-ENDOSPERM IDD genes reveal functional interactions with SCARECROW during leaf patterning in C4 grasses.,"Leaves comprise a number of different cell-types that are patterned in the context of either the epidermal or inner cell layers. In grass leaves, two distinct anatomies develop in the inner leaf tissues depending on whether the leaf carries out C3 or C4 photosynthesis. In both cases a series of parallel veins develops that extends from the leaf base to the tip but in ancestral C3 species veins are separated by a greater number of intervening mesophyll cells than in derived C4 species. We have previously demonstrated that the GRAS transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) regulates the number of photosynthetic mesophyll cells that form between veins in the leaves of the C4 species maize, whereas it regulates the formation of stomata in the epidermal leaf layer in the C3 species rice. Here we show that SCR is required for inner leaf patterning in the C4 species Setaria viridis but in this species the presumed ancestral stomatal patterning role is also retained. Through a comparative mutant analysis between maize, setaria and rice we further demonstrate that loss of NAKED-ENDOSPERM (NKD) INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) protein function exacerbates loss of function scr phenotypes in the inner leaf tissues of maize and setaria but not rice. Specifically, in both setaria and maize, scr;nkd mutants exhibit an increased proportion of fused veins with no intervening mesophyll cells. Thus, combined action of SCR and NKD may control how many mesophyll cells are specified between veins in the leaves of C4 but not C3 grasses. Together our results provide insight into the evolution of cell patterning in grass leaves and demonstrate a novel patterning role for IDD genes in C4 leaves. Author summary: he correct patterning of cell-types within organs is required to ensure appropriate morphology and physiology in any organism. In grasses, two distinct cellular patterns develop in internal leaf tissues depending on the type of photosynthesis that is carried out. Previous work suggested that the transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) has different patterning roles in leaves of rice and maize which carry out ‘C3’ versus ‘C4’ photosynthesis, respectively. SCR patterns epidermal cell-types in rice leaves and internal leaf tissues in maize. Here we generate scr mutations in another C4 plant, Setaria viridis, and reveal patterning defects in both the epidermis and inner leaf tissues. This observation provides information about the evolutionary trajectory of the SCR patterning pathway in grasses but also raises the question of how the inner leaf patterning component is distinguished from the epidermal role. Through the identification of genetic interactions between SCR and a second transcription factor NAKED-ENDOSPERM (NKD) we demonstrate that combined SCR/NKD function patterns inner leaf tissues in the C4 grasses maize and S. viridis but not in the C3 grass rice. We propose that patterning of epidermal cell-types represents the ancestral role for SCR in grass leaves and that as C4 grasses evolved, the gene was recruited along with NKD to pattern inner leaf cell types. Some C4 species have retained the ancestral function whereas others such as maize have not."
37070560,agrobacterium mediated transformation,New T-DNA binary vectors with NptII selection and RUBY reporter for efficient maize transformation and targeted mutagenesis.,"We adopted NptII/geneticin for our ternary vector system for plant transformation and greatly reduced the escape rates for the rapid Agrobacterium-mediated B104 transformation. Our empty vectors are compatible with many existing Gateway entry vectors that are available from Addgene, and new GOIs and CRISPR-Cas reagents can be easily cloned into them for plant transformation and gene editing applications. The engineered sgRNA scaffold (Dang et al., 2015) showed promising results for CRISPR- Cas9-mediated gene editing efficiencies, with about two-thirds of the T0 plants being loss-of-function mutants. Although we only tested single sgRNA for gene editing, we generated Golden Gate entry vectors for up to 8 sgRNAs (Supplementary Figure S2), thus can be used for a wide range of applications. Moreover, we observed that the betalain biosynthesis genes, RUBY, produce purple pigments in most maize tissues throughout the developmental stages, indicating that RUBY can serve as an excellent visible marker for maize transformation. To reduce betalain accumulation in plant tissue that can lead to growth retardation, strategies of using weaker constitutive or inducible promoters to drive RUBY gene system could be considered. Together with the helper plasmid pKL2299 (Kang et al., 2022), our new T-DNA binary vectors and engineered sgRNA entry vectors can provide highly efficient systems for both gene overexpression and targeted mutagenesis in maize."
37093289,response to salt; assimilate partitioning,Sugar transporter ZmSWEET1b is responsible for assimilate allocation and salt stress response in maize.,"Sugar efflux transporter SWEET family is involved in multiple biological processes, from nectar secretion, pollen fertility to seed filling. Although roles of SWEETs in abiotic stress adaption have been revealed mainly in reference organism Arabidopsis, cereal crops SWEETs responses to abiotic stimulation remain largely elusive. Here, we report the characterization of maize SWEET family member ZmSWEET1b, with emphasis on its response to salinity stress. ZmSWEET1b is a canonical sugar transporter, characteristic of seven transmembrane helices and plasma membrane localization. ZmSWEET1b and its rice ortholog OsSWEET1b in phylogenetic clade I underwent convergent selection during evolution. Two independent knockout lines were created by the CRISPR/Cas9 method to functionally characterized ZmSWEET1b. Sucrose and fructose contents are significantly decreased in ZmSWEET1b knockout lines. Mature leaves of ZmSWEET1b-edited lines exhibit chlorosis, reminiscent of senescence-like phenotype. Ears and seeds of ZmSWEET1b knockout lines are small. Upon salinity treatment, ZmSWEET1b-edited lines become more wilted. Transcriptional abundance of genes for Na+ efflux from roots to the rhizosphere, including ZmSOS1, ZmH+-ATPASE 2, and ZmH+-ATPASE 8, is decreased in salt-treated ZmSWEET1b knockout lines. These findings indicate that convergently selected sugar transporter ZmSWEET1b is important for maize plant development and responses to salt stress. The manipulation of ZmSWEET1b may represent a feasible way forward in the breeding of salinity tolerant ideotypes through the optimization of assimilate allocation."
37093290,response to cold stress,QTL-seq and transcriptomic integrative analyses reveal two positively regulated genes that control the low-temperature germination ability of MTP-maize introgression lines.,"Two candidate genes (ZmbZIP113 and ZmTSAH1) controlling low-temperature germination ability were identified by QTL-seq and integrative transcriptomic analyses. The functional verification results showed that two candidate genes positively regulated the low-temperature germination ability of IB030. Low-temperature conditions cause slow maize (Zea mays L.) seed metabolism, resulting in slow seedling emergence and irregular seedling emergence, which can cause serious yield loss. Thus, improving a maize cultivar's low-temperature germination ability (LTGA) is vital for increasing yield production. Wild relatives of maize, such as Z. perennis and Tripsacum dactyloides, are strongly tolerant of cold stress and can thus be used to improve the LTGA of maize. In a previous study, the genetic bridge MTP was constructed (from maize, T. dactyloides, and Z. perennis) and used to obtain a highly LTGA maize introgression line (IB030) by backcross breeding. In this study, IB030 (Strong-LTGA) and Mo17 (Weak-LTGA) were selected as parents to construct an F2 offspring. Additionally, two major QTLs (qCS1-1 and qCS10-1) were mapped. Then, RNA-seq was performed using seeds of IB030 and the recurrent parent B73 treated at 10 °C for 27 days and 25 °C for 7 days, respectively, and two candidate genes (ZmbZIP113 and ZmTSAH1) controlling LTGA were located using QTL-seq and integrative transcriptomic analyses. The functional verification results showed that the two candidate genes positively regulated LTGA of IB030. Notably, homologous cloning showed that the source of variation in both candidate genes was the stable inheritance of introgressed alleles from Z. perennis. This study was thus able to analyze the LTGA mechanism of IB030 and identify resistance genes for genetic improvement in maize, and it proved that using MTP genetic bridge confers desirable traits or phenotypes of Z. perennis and tripsacum essential to maize breeding systems. Key message: Two candidate genes (ZmbZIP113 and ZmTSAH1) controlling low-temperature germination ability were identified by QTL-seq and integrative transcriptomic analyses. The functional verification results showed that two candidate genes positively regulated the low-temperature germination ability of IB030."
37094478,pericarp color; phenolic content; Anthocyanin content,"Sonoprocessing improves phenolics profile, antioxidant capacity, structure, and product qualities of purple corn pericarp extract.","For the first time, purple corn pericarp (PCP) was converted to polyphenol-rich extract using two-pot ultrasound extraction technique. According to Plackett-Burman design (PBD), the significant extraction factors were ethanol concentration, extraction time, temperature, and ultrasonic amplitude that affected total anthocyanins (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC), and condensed tannins (CT). These parameters were further optimized using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method for response surface methodology (RSM). The RSM showed a linear curvature for TAC and a quadratic curvature for TPC and CT with a lack of fit > 0.05. Under the optimum conditions (ethanol (50%, v/v), time (21 min), temperature (28 °C), and ultrasonic amplitude (50%)), a maximum TAC, TPC, and CT of 34.99 g cyanidin/kg, 121.26 g GAE/kg, and 260.59 of EE/kg, respectively were obtained with a desirability value 0.952. Comparing UAE to microwave extraction (MAE), it was found that although UAE had a lower extraction yield, TAC, TPC, and CT, the UAE gave a higher individual anthocyanin, flavonoid, phenolic acid profile, and antioxidant activity. The UAE took 21 min, whereas MAE took 30 min for maximum extraction. Regarding product qualities, UAE extract was superior, with a lower total color change (ΔE) and a higher chromaticity. Structural characterization using SEM showed that MAE extract had severe creases and ruptures, whereas UAE extract had less noticeable alterations and was attested by an optical profilometer. This shows that ultrasound, might be used to extract phenolics from PCP as it requires lesser time and improves phenolics, structure, and product qualities."
37101396,response to salt,Cytokinin signaling promotes salt tolerance by modulating shoot chloride exclusion in maize.,"Excessive accumulation of chloride (Cl-) in the aboveground tissues under saline (NaCl) conditions is harmful to crops. Increasing the exclusion of Cl- from shoots promotes salt tolerance in various crops. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a type-A response regulator (ZmRR1) confers a natural variation of maize salt tolerance by modulating Cl- exclusion from shoots. ZmRR1 negatively regulates cytokinin signaling and salt tolerance, likely by interacting with and inhibiting His phosphotransfer (HP) proteins (key mediators of cytokinin signaling). A naturally occurring non-synonymous SNP variant enhances the interaction between ZmRR1 and ZmHP2, yielding a salt-hypersensitive phenotype. ZmRR1 undergoes degradation under saline conditions, leading to the release of ZmHP2 from ZmRR1 inhibition, and subsequently ZmHP2-mediated signaling improves salt tolerance primarily by promoting Cl- exclusion from shoots. Next, we showed that ZmMATE29 is transcriptionally upregulated by ZmHP2-mediated signaling under highly saline conditions and encodes a tonoplast-located Cl- transporter that promotes Cl- exclusion from shoots by compartmentalizing Cl- into the vacuoles of root cortex cells. Our study provides an important mechanistic understanding of the cytokinin signaling-mediated promotion of Cl- exclusion from shoots and salt tolerance. Therefore, genetic modification to promote Cl- exclusion from shoots is a promising route for developing salt-tolerant maize."
37102770,disease response,Maize phytocytokines modulate pro-survival host responses and pathogen resistance.,"Phytocytokines are signalling peptides that alarm plant cells of danger. However, the downstream responses triggered by phytocytokines and their effect on plant survival are still largely unknown. Here, we have identified three biologically active maize orthologues of phytocytokines previously described in other plants. The maize phytocytokines show common features with microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including the induction of immune-related genes and activation of papain-like cysteine proteases. In contrast to MAMPs, phytocytokines do not promote cell death in the presence of wounding. In infection assays with two fungal pathogens we found that phytocytokines affect the development of disease symptoms, likely due to the activation of phytohormonal pathways. Collectively, our results show that phytocytokines and MAMPs trigger unique and antagonistic features of immunity. We propose a model in which phytocytokines activate immune responses partially similar to MAMPs but in contrast to microbial signals, they act as danger and survival molecules to the surrounding cells. Future studies will focus on the components determining the divergence of signalling outputs upon phytocytokine activation."
37113598,haploid production,"Combining ability of tropical × temperate maize inducers for haploid induction rate, R1-nj seed set, and agronomic traits.","In vivo maternal haploid induction in isolation fields is proposed to bypass the workload and resource constraints existing in haploid induction nurseries. A better understanding of combining ability and gene action conditioning traits related to hybrid inducers is necessary to set the breeding strategy including to what extent parent-based hybrid prediction is feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the following in tropical savanna in the rainy and dry seasons for haploid induction rate (HIR), R1-nj seed set, and agronomic traits: 1) combining ability, line per se, and hybrid performance of three genetic pools; 2) genetic parameters, the modes of gene action, and heterosis; and 3) the relationships of inbred-general combining ability (GCA) and inbred-hybrid performance. Fifty-six diallel crosses derived from eight maize genotypes were evaluated in the rainy season of 2021 and the dry season of 2021/2022. Reciprocal cross effects including the maternal effect barely contributed to the genotypic variance for each trait observed. HIR, R1-nj seed set, flowering dates, and ear position were highly heritable and additive inherited, while ear length showed dominant inheritance. The equal importance of additive and dominance effects was found for yield-related traits. Temperate inducer BHI306 was the best general combiner for the HIR and R1-nj seed set, followed by two tropical inducers, KHI47 and KHI54. The ranges of heterosis were trait-dependent and slightly influenced by the environment, where hybrids in the rainy season consistently had higher heterosis than those in the dry season for each trait observed. Both hybrid groups derived from tropical × tropical and tropical × temperate inducers showed taller plants, larger ear size, and higher seed sets than the corresponding parents. However, their HIRs were still below the standard check of BHI306. The implications of genetic information, combining ability, and inbred-GCA and inbred-hybrid relationships on breeding strategies are discussed."
37116226,Stress response; germination index,ZmCIPK32 positively regulates germination of stressed seeds via gibberellin signal.,"Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) as specific calcium sensors that interact with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) play a key role in the regulation of plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, we isolated and characterized the CIPK32 gene from Zea mays. ZmCIPK32 showed that it comprised 440 amino acids and a conserved NAF motif responsible for the interaction with CBLs localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. The interaction of ZmCIPK32 with ZmCBL1 and ZmCBL9 demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay required the presence of the NAF domain. Overexpression of ZmCIPK32 promoted early germination in transgenic Arabidopsis seeds relative to that observed in wild-type (WT) plants under mannitol treatment. In addition, ZmCIPK32-overexpressing plants were insensitive to treatments with exogenous abscisic acid and paclobutrazol (PBZ) at seed germination and early seedling stages. Expression levels of the key genes GA20ox and GA3ox involved in the synthesis of gibberellin (GA) were increased, whereas expression levels of genes involved in the conversion of active GA to inactive forms and GA signaling were reduced in ZmCIPK32-overexpressing plants relative to those in WT plants under mannitol and PBZ treatments. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmCIPK32 increased GA level but decreased abscisic acid level in transgenic lines compared to the respective levels in WT plants under PBZ or mannitol treatments. Our results suggest that ZmCIPK32 positively regulates seed germination under stressed conditions by modulating GA signals."
37123832,kernel type,Self-supervised maize kernel classification and segmentation for embryo identification.,"Introduction: Computer vision and deep learning (DL) techniques have succeeded in a wide range of diverse fields. Recently, these techniques have been successfully deployed in plant science applications to address food security, productivity, and environmental sustainability problems for a growing global population. However, training these DL models often necessitates the large-scale manual annotation of data which frequently becomes a tedious and time-and-resource- intensive process. Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have proven instrumental in overcoming these obstacles, using purely unlabeled datasets to pre-train DL models. Methods: Here, we implement the popular self-supervised contrastive learning methods of NNCLR Nearest neighbor Contrastive Learning of visual Representations) and SimCLR (Simple framework for Contrastive Learning of visual Representations) for the classification of spatial orientation and segmentation of embryos of maize kernels. Maize kernels are imaged using a commercial high-throughput imaging system. This image data is often used in multiple downstream applications across both production and breeding applications, for instance, sorting for oil content based on segmenting and quantifying the scutellum's size and for classifying haploid and diploid kernels. Results and discussion: We show that in both classification and segmentation problems, SSL techniques outperform their purely supervised transfer learning-based counterparts and are significantly more annotation efficient. Additionally, we show that a single SSL pre-trained model can be efficiently finetuned for both classification and segmentation, indicating good transferability across multiple downstream applications. Segmentation models with SSL-pretrained backbones produce DICE similarity coefficients of 0.81, higher than the 0.78 and 0.73 of those with ImageNet-pretrained and randomly initialized backbones, respectively. We observe that finetuning classification and segmentation models on as little as 1% annotation produces competitive results. These results show SSL provides a meaningful step forward in data efficiency with agricultural deep learning and computer vision."
37124872,response to heat stress,Conserved and variable heat stress responses of the Heat Shock Factor transcription factor family in maize and Setaria viridis.,"The Heat Shock Factor (HSF) transcription factor family is a central and required component of plant heat stress responses and acquired thermotolerance. The HSF family has dramatically expanded in plant lineages, often including a repertoire of 20 or more genes. Here we assess and compare the composition, heat responsiveness, and chromatin profiles of the HSF families in maize and Setaria viridis (Setaria), two model C4 panicoid grasses. Both species encode a similar number of HSFs, and examples of both conserved and variable expression responses to a heat stress event were observed between the two species. Chromatin accessibility and genome-wide DNA-binding profiles were generated to assess the chromatin of HSF family members with distinct responses to heat stress. We observed significant variability for both chromatin accessibility and promoter occupancy within similarly regulated sets of HSFs between Setaria and maize, as well as between syntenic pairs of maize HSFs retained following its most recent genome duplication event. Additionally, we observed the widespread presence of TF binding at HSF promoters in control conditions, even at HSFs that are only expressed in response to heat stress. TF-binding peaks were typically near putative HSF-binding sites in HSFs upregulated in response to heat stress, but not in stable or not expressed HSFs. These observations collectively support a complex scenario of expansion and subfunctionalization within this transcription factor family and suggest that within-family HSF transcriptional regulation is a conserved, defining feature of the family."
37127254,response to salt,Inhibition of the maize salt overly sensitive pathway by ZmSK3 and ZmSK4,"Soil salinity is a worldwide problem that adversely affects plant growth and crop productivity. The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is evolutionarily conserved and essential for plant salt tolerance. In this study, we reveal how the maize shaggy/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinases ZmSK3 and ZmSK4, orthologs of brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2) in Arabidopsis thaliana, regulate the maize SOS pathway. ZmSK3 and ZmSK4 interact with and phosphorylate ZmSOS2, a core member of the maize SOS pathway. The mutants defective in ZmSK3 or ZmSK4 are hyposensitive to salt stress, with higher salt-induced activity of ZmSOS2 than that in the wild type. Furthermore, the Ca2+ sensors ZmSOS3 and ZmSOS3-like calcium binding protein 8 (ZmSCaBP8) activate ZmSOS2 to maintain Na+/K+ homeostasis under salt stress, and may participate in the regulation of ZmSOS2 by ZmSK3 and ZmSK4. These findings discover the regulation of the maize SOS pathway and provide important gene targets for breeding salt-tolerant maize."
37142873,response to heavy metals,A genome-wide co-expression network analysis revealed ZmNRAMP6-mediated regulatory pathway involved in maize tolerance to lead stress.,"A metal transporter ZmNRAMP6 was identified by using a trait-associated co-expression network analysis at a genome-wide level. ZmNRAMP6 confers maize sensitivity to Pb by accumulating it to maize shoots. ZmNRAMP6 knockout detains Pb in roots, activates antioxidant enzymes, and improves Pb tolerance. Lead (Pb) is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants, which can penetrate plant cells via root absorption and thus cause irreversible damages to the human body through the food chain. To identify the key gene responsible for Pb tolerance in maize, we performed a trait-associated co-expression network analysis at a genome-wide level, using two maize lines with contrasting Pb tolerances. Finally, ZmNRAMP6 that encodes a metal transporter was identified as the key gene among the Pb tolerance-associated co-expression module. Heterologous expression of ZmNRAMP6 in yeast verified its role in Pb transport. Combined Arabidopsis overexpression and maize mutant analysis suggested that ZmNRAMP6 conferred plant sensitivity to Pb stress by mediating Pb distribution across the roots and shoots. Knockout of ZmNRAMP6 caused Pb retention in the roots and activation of the antioxidant enzyme system, resulting in an increased Pb tolerance in maize. ZmNRAMP6 was likely to transport Pb from the roots to shoots and environment. An integration of yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assay uncovered that ZmNRAMP6 was negatively regulated by a known Pb tolerance-related transcript factor ZmbZIP54. Collectively, knockout of ZmNRAMP6 will aid in the bioremediation of contaminated soil and food safety guarantee of forage and grain corn. Key message: A metal transporter ZmNRAMP6 was identified by using a trait-associated co-expression network analysis at a genome-wide level. ZmNRAMP6 confers maize sensitivity to Pb by accumulating it to maize shoots. ZmNRAMP6 knockout detains Pb in roots, activates antioxidant enzymes, and improves Pb tolerance."
37147346,drought response,Characterization of ZmPMP3g function in drought tolerance of maize.,"The genes enconding proteins containing plasma membrane proteolipid 3 (PMP3) domain are responsive to abiotic stresses, but their functions in maize drought tolerance remain largely unknown. In this study, the transgenic maize lines overexpressing maize ZmPMP3g gene were featured by enhanced drought tolerance; increases in total root length, activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and leaf water content; and decreases in leaf water potential, levels of O2-·and H2O2, and malondialdehyde content under drought. Under treatments with foliar spraying with abscisic acid (ABA), drought tolerance of both transgenic line Y7-1 overexpressing ZmPMP3g and wild type Ye478 was enhanced, of which Y7-1 showed an increased endogenous ABA and decreased endogenous gibberellin (GA) 1 (significantly) and GA3 (very slightly but not significantly) and Ye478 had a relatively lower ABA and no changes in GA1 and GA3. ZmPMP3g overexpression in Y7-1 affected the expression of multiple key transcription factor genes in ABA-dependent and -independent drought signaling pathways. These results indicate that ZmPMP3g overexpression plays a role in maize drought tolerance by harmonizing ABA-GA1-GA3 homeostasis/balance, improving root growth, enhancing antioxidant capacity, maintaining membrane lipid integrity, and regulating intracellular osmotic pressure. A working model on ABA-GA-ZmPMP3g was proposed and discussed."
37155015,Abiotic stress response; wound response,Comparative transcriptome analysis of Zea mays upon mechanical wounding.,"Background: Mechanical wounding (MW) is mainly caused due to high wind, sand, heavy rains and insect infestation, leading to damage to crop plants and an increase in the incidences of pathogen infection. Plants respond to MW by altering expression of genes, proteins, and metabolites that help them to cope up with the stress. Methods and results: In order to characterize maize transcriptome in response to mechanical wounding, a microarray analysis was executed. The study revealed 407 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (134 upregulated and 273 downregulated). The upregulated genes were engaged in protein synthesis, transcription regulation, phytohormone signaling-mediated by salicylic acid, auxin, jasmonates, biotic and abiotic stress including bacterial, insect, salt and endoplasmic reticulum stress, cellular transport, on the other hand downregulated genes were involved in primary metabolism, developmental processes, protein modification, catalytic activity, DNA repair pathways, and cell cycle. Conclusion: The transcriptome data present here can be further utilized for understanding inducible transcriptional response during mechanical injury and their purpose in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore, future study concentrating on the functional characterization of the selected key genes (Bowman Bird trypsin inhibitor, NBS-LRR-like protein, Receptor-like protein kinase-like, probable LRR receptor-like ser/thr-protein kinase, Cytochrome P450 84A1, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, jasmonate O-methyltransferase) and utilizing them for genetic engineering for crop improvement is strongly recommended."
37156701,Abiotic stress response,Extra-large G proteins have extra-large effects on agronomic traits and stress tolerance in maize and rice.,"Heterotrimeric G proteins - comprising Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits - are ubiquitous elements in eukaryotic cell signaling. Plant genomes contain both canonical Gα subunit genes and a family of plant-specific extra-large G protein genes (XLGs) that encode proteins consisting of a domain with Gα-like features downstream of a long N-terminal domain. In this review we summarize phenotypes modulated by the canonical Gα and XLG proteins of arabidopsis and highlight recent studies in maize and rice that reveal dramatic phenotypic consequences of XLG clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) mutagenesis in these important crop species. XLGs have both redundant and specific roles in the control of agronomically relevant plant architecture and resistance to both abiotic and biotic stresses. We also point out areas of current controversy, suggest future research directions, and propose a revised, phylogenetically-based nomenclature for XLG protein genes."
37165143,response to Gibberella stalk rot; photoperiod response,Effects of the quantitative trait locus qPss3 on inhibition of photoperiod sensitivity and resistance to stalk rot disease in maize.,"We identified a quantitative trait locus, qPss3, and fine-mapped the causal locus to a 120-kb interval in maize. This locus inhibits the photoperiod sensitivity caused by ZmCCT9 and ZmCCT10, resulting in earlier flowering by 2 ~ 4 days without reduction in stalk-rot resistance in certain genotypes. Photoperiod sensitivity is a key factor affecting the adaptation of maize (Zea mays L.) to high-latitude growing areas. Although many genes associated with flowering time have been identified in maize, no gene that inhibits photoperiod sensitivity has been reported. In our previous study, we detected large differences in photoperiod sensitivity among maize inbred lines with the same photoperiod-sensitive allele at the ZmCCT10 locus. Here, we used two segregating populations with the same genetic backgrounds but different ZmCCT10 alleles to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. We identified a unique QTL, qPss3, on chromosome 3 in the population carrying the sensitive ZmCCT10 allele. After sequential fine-mapping, we eventually delimited qPss3 to an interval of ~ 120 kb. qPss3 behaved as a dominant locus and caused earlier flowering by 2-4 days via inhibiting ZmCCT10-induced photoperiod sensitivity under long-day conditions. qPss3 also inhibited the photoperiod sensitivity induced by another flowering-related gene, ZmCCT9. For application in agriculture, an F1 hybrid heterozygous at both qPss3 and ZmCCT10 loci constitutes an optimal allele combination, showing high resistance to stalk rot without a significant delay in flowering time. Moreover, qPss3 is of great value in regulating the flowering time of tropical maize grown at high-latitude regions. Key message: We identified a quantitative trait locus, qPss3 , and fine-mapped the causal locus to a 120-kb interval in maize. This locus inhibits the photoperiod sensitivity caused by ZmCCT9 and ZmCCT10 , resulting in earlier flowering by 2 ~ 4 days without reduction in stalk-rot resistance in certain genotypes."
37166602,response to iron,A Simple Semi-hydroponic System for Studying Iron Homeostasis in Maize.,"Hydroponic-based systems for plant growth allow control of the nutrients that plants take up through the provided nutrient solution. Different formulations of nutrient solutions enable the study of nutrient deficiencies in plants. Here we describe a procedure for setting up a simple semi-hydroponic system to grow maize seedlings. The system can be set up on a small or large scale, depending on the number of individuals studied. A modified nutrient solution is used for growing maize seedlings in iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions. This setup allows for studies of iron-deficiency responses in maize."
37170764,internode elongation,Deciphering transcriptional mechanisms of maize internodal elongation by regulatory network analysis.,"Basal internode length is important for lodging resistance of maize (Zea mays L.). In this study, foliar application of coronatine (COR) at the V8 stage differentially suppressed the length of the eighth internode of 10 cultivars, and three, five, and two cultivars were demonstrated to have strong (SC), moderate (MC), and weak (WC) degrees of internode shortening, respectively. RNA-Seq of the eighth internode of these cultivars revealed a total of 7895 internode elongation-regulating genes (IEGs, including 777 transcription factors (TFs)). Compared with those in WC, the hormone-related genes of cytokinin (CTK), gibberellin (GA), auxin and ethylene (ET) genes in SC were significantly downregulated, and more cell cycle regulatory factors and cell wall related genes showed significant changes, which severely inhibited internode elongation. Furthermore, we explored the direct regulatory relationship between two important TFs and target genes using EMSA, ZmABI7 and ZmMYB117, which regulate the cell cycle and cell wall modification by directly binding to the promoters of ZmCYC1, ZmCYC3, ZmCYC7, and ZmCPP1. The landscape transcriptome atlas reported herein provides a useful resource for studying maize internode development, which may provide a genetic basis for targeted control of internode length to improve lodging tolerance of maize."
37170821,response to cold stress,A meta-analysis reveals differential sensitivity of cold stress responses in the maize leaf.,"Maize (Zea mays), a cold-sensitive crop, requires cold tolerance for extending the length of the growing season in temperate climates. However, response curves to different cold temperatures and exposure durations are lacking. We used a meta-analysis approach using data from literature to investigate the effect of cold stress in the maize leaf. We constructed response curves to temperature and exposure durations for 18 key parameters related to leaf growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress, antioxidants, and the phytohormone ABA. To determine their relevance for cold tolerance, we compared cold tolerant Flint and cold sensitive Dent lines. Treatment temperatures ranged from -20°C to 20°C for cold and from 12°C to 30°C for control and exposure duration from 3 min to 60 days. We found interacting effects of temperature and exposure durations on different response parameters. The strongest difference between Flint and Dent was observed for electrolyte leakage (EL). Our results show that the commonly used 4°C for cold and 25°C for control with medium cold exposure (1-7 days) induces a 50% decrease in shoot dry weight and leaf area and that EL is an easy and reliable indicator for cold tolerance studies."
37188493,response to Gibberella stalk rot,Beneficial rhizobacterium triggers induced systemic resistance of maize to Gibberella stalk rot via calcium signaling.,"Gibberella stalk rot (GSR) caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum is a devastating disease of maize (Zea mays L.), but we lack efficient methods to control this disease. Biological control agents, including beneficial microorganisms, can be used as an effective and eco-friendly approach to manage crop diseases. For example, Bacillus velezensis SQR9, a bacterial strain isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumber plants, promotes growth and suppresses diseases in several plant species. However, it is not known whether and how SQR9 affects maize resistance to GSR. In this study, we found that treatment with SQR9 increased maize resistance to GSR by activating maize induced systemic resistance (ISR). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis showed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction pathways were enriched in the root upon colonization by SQR9. Also, several genes associated with calcium signaling pathways were up-regulated by SQR9 treatment. However, the calcium signaling inhibitor LaCl3 weakened the SQR9-activated ISR. Our data suggest that the calcium signaling pathway contributes to maize GSR resistance via the activation of ISR induced by SQR9."
37188973,root morphology,Mining genes regulating root system architecture in maize based on data integration analysis,"Root system architecture (RSA) is crucial for crops productivity and stress tolerance. In maize, few RSA genes are functionally cloned, and effective discovery of RSA genes remains a great of challenge. In this work, we established a strategy to mine maize RSA genes by integrating functionally characterized root genes, root transcriptome, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of RSA traits based on public data resources. A total of 589 maize root genes were collected by searching well-characterized root genes in maize or homologous genes of other species. We performed WGCNA to construct a maize root gene co-expression network containing 13874 genes based on public available root transcriptome data, and further discovered the 53 hub genes related to root traits. In addition, by the prediction function of obtained root gene co-expression network, a total of 1082 new root candidate genes were explored. By further overlapping the obtained new root candidate gene with the root-related GWAS of RSA candidate genes, 16 priority root candidate genes were identified. Finally, a priority root candidate gene, Zm00001d023379 (encodes pyruvate kinase 2), was validated to modulate root open angle and shoot-borne roots number using its overexpression transgenic lines. Our results develop an integration analysis method for effectively exploring regulatory genes of RSA in maize and open a new avenue to mine the candidate genes underlying complex traits. Key message: A new strategy that integrated multiple public data resources was established to construct root gene co-expression network and mine genes regulating root system architecture in maize. A root gene co-expression network, containing 13,874 genes, was constructed. A total of 53 root hub genes and 16 priority root candidate genes were identified. One priority root candidate was further functionally verified using overexpression transgenic maize lines."
37194956,leaf canopy architecture,Exploring 3D leaf anatomical traits for C4 photosynthesis: chloroplast and plasmodesmata pit field size in maize and sugarcane.,"Volume and surface area of chloroplasts and surface area of plasmodesmata pit fields are presented for two C4 species, maize and sugarcane, with respect to cell surface area and cell volume. Serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy with the Airyscan system (LSM) were used. Chloroplast size estimates were much faster and easier using LSM than with SBF-SEM; however, the results were more variable than SBF-SEM. Mesophyll cells were lobed where chloroplasts were located, facilitating cell-to-cell connections while allowing for greater intercellular airspace exposure. Bundle sheath cells were cylindrical with chloroplasts arranged centrifugally. Chloroplasts occupied c. 30-50% of mesophyll cell volume, and 60-70% of bundle sheath cell volume. Roughly 2-3% of each cell surface area was covered by plasmodesmata pit fields for both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. This work will aid future research to develop SBF-SEM methodologies with the aim to better understand the effect of cell structure on C4 photosynthesis."
37195892,haploid production,The RUBY reporter enables efficient haploid identification in maize and tomato.,"In vivo haploid induction has been extended from maize to monocotyledonous plants like rice, wheat, millet and dicotyledonous plants such as tomato, rapeseed, tobacco and cabbage. Accurate identification of haploids is a crucial step of doubled haploid technology, where a useful identification marker is very pivotal. R1-nj is an extensively used visual marker for haploid identification in maize. RFP and eGFP have been shown to be feasible in identifying haploid. However, these methods are either limited to specific species, or require specific equipment. It still lacks an efficient visual marker that is practical across different crop species. In this study, we introduced the RUBY reporter, a betalain biosynthesis system, into maize and tomato haploid inducers as a new marker for haploid identification. Results showed that expression of RUBY could result in deep betalain pigmentation in maize embryos as early as 10 days after pollination, and enabled 100% accuracy of immature haploid embryo identification. Further investigation in tomato revealed that the new marker led to deep red pigmentation in radicles and haploids can be identified easily and accurately. The results demonstrated that the RUBY reporter is a background-independent and efficient marker for haploid identification and would be promising in doubled haploid breeding across different crop species."
37219338,stomata number,Leaf cell wall properties and stomatal density influence oxygen isotope enrichment of leaf water.,"Measurements of oxygen isotope enrichment of leaf water above source water (Δ18 OLW ) can improve our understanding of the interaction between leaf anatomy and physiology on leaf water transport. Models have been developed to predict Δ18 OLW such as the string-of-lakes model, which describes the mixing of leaf water pools, and the Péclet effect model, which incorporates transpiration rate and the mixing length between unenriched xylem and enriched mesophyll water in the mesophyll (Lm ) or veins (Lv ). Here we compare measurements and models of Δ18 OLW on two cell wall composition mutants grown under two light intensities and relative humidities to evaluate cell wall properties on leaf water transport. In maize (Zea mays), the compromised ultrastructure of the suberin lamellae in the bundle sheath of the ALIPHATIC SUBERIN FERULOYL TRANSFERASE mutant (Zmasft) reduced barriers to apoplastic water movement, resulting in higher E and, potentially, Lv and, consequently, lower Δ18 OLW . The difference in Δ18 OLW in cellulose synthase-like F6 (CslF6) mutants and wild-type of rice (Oryza sativa) grown under two light intensities co-varied with stomatal density. These results show that cell wall composition and stomatal density influence Δ18 OLW and that stable isotopes can facilitate the development of a physiologically and anatomically explicit water transport model."
37223800,drought response,Genome-wide association study presents insights into the genetic architecture of drought tolerance in maize seedlings under field water-deficit conditions.,"Drought stress is one of the most serious abiotic stresses leading to crop yield reduction. Due to the wide range of planting areas, the production of maize is particularly affected by global drought stress. The cultivation of drought-resistant maize varieties can achieve relatively high, stable yield in arid and semi-arid zones and in the erratic rainfall or occasional drought areas. Therefore, to a great degree, the adverse impact of drought on maize yield can be mitigated by developing drought-resistant or -tolerant varieties. However, the efficacy of traditional breeding solely relying on phenotypic selection is not adequate for the need of maize drought-resistant varieties. Revealing the genetic basis enables to guide the genetic improvement of maize drought tolerance.We utilized a maize association panel of 379 inbred lines with tropical, subtropical and temperate backgrounds to analyze the genetic structure of maize drought tolerance at seedling stage. We obtained the high quality 7837 SNPs from DArT's and 91,003 SNPs from GBS, and a resultant combination of 97,862 SNPs of GBS with DArT's. The maize population presented the lower her-itabilities of the seedling emergence rate (ER), seedling plant height (SPH) and grain yield (GY) under field drought conditions.GWAS analysis by MLM and BLINK models with the phenotypic data and 97862 SNPs revealed 15 variants that were significantly independent related to drought-resistant traits at the seedling stage above the threshold of P < 1.02 × 10-5. We found 15 candidate genes for drought resistance at the seedling stage that may involve in (1) metabolism (Zm00001d012176, Zm00001d012101, Zm00001d009488); (2) programmed cell death (Zm00001d053952); (3) transcriptional regulation (Zm00001d037771, Zm00001d053859, Zm00001d031861, Zm00001d038930, Zm00001d049400, Zm00001d045128 and Zm00001d043036); (4) autophagy (Zm00001d028417); and (5) cell growth and development (Zm00001d017495). The most of them in B73 maize line were shown to change the expression pattern in response to drought stress. These results provide useful information for understanding the genetic basis of drought stress tolerance of maize at seedling stage."
37235028,response to Striga,Genetic resources and breeding of maize for Striga resistance: a review,"The potential yield of maize (Zea mays L.) and other major crops is curtailed by several biotic, abiotic, and socio-economic constraints. Parasitic weeds, Striga spp., are major constraints to cereal and legume crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yield losses reaching 100% are reported in maize under severe Striga infestation. Breeding for Striga resistance has been shown to be the most economical, feasible, and sustainable approach for resource-poor farmers and for being environmentally friendly. Knowledge of the genetic and genomic resources and components of Striga resistance is vital to guide genetic analysis and precision breeding of maize varieties with desirable product profiles under Striga infestation. This review aims to present the genetic and genomic resources, research progress, and opportunities in the genetic analysis of Striga resistance and yield components in maize for breeding. The paper outlines the vital genetic resources of maize for Striga resistance, including landraces, wild relatives, mutants, and synthetic varieties, followed by breeding technologies and genomic resources. Integrating conventional breeding, mutation breeding, and genomic-assisted breeding [i.e., marker-assisted selection, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, next-generation sequencing, and genome editing] will enhance genetic gains in Striga resistance breeding programs. This review may guide new variety designs for Striga-resistance and desirable product profiles in maize."
37245767,response to Fusarium ear rot,MicroRNAs involved in the trans-kingdom gene regulation in the interaction of maize kernels and Fusarium verticillioides.,"Maize ear rot is a widespread disease and the main pathogen is Fusarium verticillioides. Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have great effects on disease resistance and it has been reported that maize miRNA participates in defense responses in maize ear rot. However, the trans-kingdom regulation of miRNAs between maize and F. verticillioides remains uncharacterized. In this study, the relationship between miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) of F. verticillioides and pathogenicity was investigated, followed by sRNA analysis and degradome sequencing of miRNA profiles and the target genes of maize and F. verticillioides after inoculation. It was found that the milRNA biogenesis positively regulated the pathogenicity of F. verticillioides by knocking out the gene FvDicer2-encoded Dicer-like protein in F. verticillioides. Following inoculation with F. verticillioides, 284 known and 6571 novel miRNAs were obtained in maize, including 28 miRNAs differentially expressed at multiple time points. The target genes of maize differentially expressed miRNAs in F. verticillioides mediated multiple pathways, including autophagy and MAPK signaling pathway. Fifty-one novel F. verticillioides milRNAs were predicted to target 333 genes in maize involved in MAPK signaling pathways, plant hormone signaling transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Additionally, the miR528b-5p in maize targeted the mRNA of FvTTP which encoded a twice transmembrane protein in F. verticillioides. The FvTTP-knockout mutants displayed decreased pathogenicity and reduced synthesis of fumonisins. Thus, by interfering with the translation of FvTTP, the miR528b-5p inhibited F. verticillioides infection. These findings suggested a novel function of miR528 in resisting F. verticillioides infection. The miRNAs identified in this research and their putative target genes can be used to further elucidate the trans-kingdom functions of microRNAs in plant pathogen interaction."
37248257,kernel size,An E2-E3 pair contributes to seed size control in grain crops.,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate grain yield is important for improving agricultural productivity. Protein ubiquitination controls various aspects of plant growth but lacks understanding on how E2-E3 enzyme pairs impact grain yield in major crops. Here, we identified a RING-type E3 ligase SGD1 and its E2 partner SiUBC32 responsible for grain yield control in Setaria italica. The conserved role of SGD1 was observed in wheat, maize, and rice. Furthermore, SGD1 ubiquitinates the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, stabilizing it and promoting plant growth. Overexpression of an elite SGD1 haplotype improved grain yield by about 12.8% per plant, and promote complex biological processes such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, stress responses, photosystem stabilization, and nitrogen metabolism. Our research not only identifies the SiUBC32-SGD1-BRI1 genetic module that contributes to grain yield improvement but also provides a strategy for exploring key genes controlling important traits in Poaceae crops using the Setaria model system."
37249039,response to flooding; drought response,Multivariate analysis compares and evaluates drought and flooding tolerances of maize germplasm.,"Drought and flooding are the two most important environmental factors limiting maize (Zea mays L.) production globally. This study aimed to investigate the physiological mechanisms and accurate evaluation indicators and methods of maize germplasm involved in drought and flooding stresses. The twice replicated pot experiments with 60 varieties, combined with the field validation experiment with three varieties, were conducted under well-watered, drought, and flooding conditions. Most varieties exhibited stronger tolerance to drought than flooding due to higher antioxidant enzyme activities, osmotic adjustment substances, and lower reactive oxygen species. In contrast, flooding stress resulted in higher levels of reactive oxygen species (particularly O2-), ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase, and soluble sugars, but lower levels of superoxide dismutase, proline, and soluble protein compared with well-watered conditions. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, soluble sugars and protein contents, in addition to plant height, leaf area/plant, and stem diameter, were accurate and representative indicators for evaluating maize tolerance to drought and flooding stresses and could determine a relatively high mean forecast accuracy of 100.0% for the comprehensive evaluation value. Four principal components were extracted, in which different principal components played a vital role in resisting different water stresses. Finally, the accuracy of the three varieties screened by multivariate analysis was verified in the field. This study provides insights into the different physiological mechanisms and accurate evaluation methods of maize germplasm involved in drought and flooding stresses, which could be valuable for further research and breeding."
37251765,oil content  kernel,Genetic basis of the oil biosynthesis in ultra-high-oil maize grains with an oil content exceeding 20%,"Vegetable oil is an important part of the human diet and has multiple industrial uses. The rapid increase in vegetable oil consumption has necessitated the development of viable methods for optimizing the oil content of plants. The key genes regulating the biosynthesis of maize grain oil remain mostly uncharacterized. In this study, by analyzing oil contents and performing bulked segregant RNA sequencing and mapping analyses, we determined that su1 and sh2-R mediate the shrinkage of ultra-high-oil maize grains and contribute to the increase in the grain oil content. Functional kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers developed for su1 and sh2-R detected su1su1Sh2Sh2, Su1Su1sh2sh2, and su1su1sh2sh2 mutants among 183 sweet maize inbred lines. An RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that genes differentially expressed between two conventional sweet maize lines and two ultra-high-oil maize lines were significantly associated with linoleic acid metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. A bulk segregant analysis and sequencing (BSA-seq) analysis identified another 88 genomic intervals related to grain oil content, 16 of which overlapped previously reported maize grain oil-related QTLs. The combined analysis of BSA-seq and RNA-seq data enabled the identification of candidate genes. The KASP markers for GRMZM2G176998 (putative WD40-like beta propeller repeat family protein), GRMZM2G021339 (homeobox-transcription factor 115), and GRMZM2G167438 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase) were significantly related to maize grain oil content. Another candidate gene, GRMZM2G099802 (GDSL-like lipase/acylhydrolase), catalyzes the final step of the triacylglycerol synthesis pathway and was expressed at significantly higher levels in the two ultra-high-oil maize lines than in the two conventional sweet maize lines. These novel findings will help clarify the genetic basis of the increased oil production in ultra-high-oil maize lines with grain oil contents exceeding 20%. The KASP markers developed in this study may be useful for breeding new high-oil sweet maize varieties."
37264570,response to low phosphorus,The long-noncoding RNA PILNCR2 increases low phosphate tolerance in maize by interfering with miRNA399-guided cleavage of ZmPHT1s.,"miR399 has target sites in the open reading region of ZmPHT1s (Pi transporters) in maize. However, the relation between miR399 and ZmPHT1s and its functional importance in responses to Pi deficiency remain to be explored. We show here that ZmPHT1;1, ZmPHT1;3, and ZmPHT1;13 are the targets of ZmmiRNA399. We characterized a long-noncoding RNA PILNCR2 (Pi-deficiency-induced lncRNA 2) transcribed from the opposing DNA strand of ZmPHT1;1. PILNCR2 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. A ribonuclease protection assay and an RNA-RNA binding assay showed that PILNCR2 and ZmPHT1s could form RNA/RNA duplexes in vivo and in vitro. A co-expression assay in N. benthamiana verified that the RNA/RNA duplex interfered with the miR399-guided cleavage of mRNAs of ZmPHT1s. Overexpression of PILNCR2 increased low-Pi tolerance in maize. Knock-out and -down of PILNCR2 decreased low-Pi tolerance in maize. We further show that PILNCR2 positively regulated the mRNA abundance of ZmPHT1; 3 and ZmPHT1;13 in maize. Thus, PILNCR2 is important for Pi homeostasis in maize by interfering miRNA399-guided cleavage of mRNAs of ZmPHT1s."
37273069,drought response,Trash to treasure: lactate and protein lactylation in maize root impacts response to drought.,"Lactate, protein lactylation (Kla), and specifically histone lactylation have recently been shown to regulate antipathogenic immune responses in mammals. Herein, after we confirmed the presence and accumulation of lactate in maize roots under drought conditions, a lactylome profiling analysis revealed that Kla modifications were invariably present in maize roots, that there were obvious differences in the lactylomes of drought-sensitive (B73) vs. drought-tolerant (Jing2416) lines, and that growing Jing2416 under drought conditions caused significant decreases in the lactylation of multiple enzymes responsible for fatty acid degradation. Inspired by findings of histone-Kla based epigenetic regulation of immune functions in animals, we initially discovered 37 Kla sites on 16 histones in the maize genome, and again detected obvious differential histone Klamediated trends between two lines by ChIP-Seq. Notably, only 2.7% of genes with differential histone Kla peaks detected during drought stress were commonly present in both lines, a finding demonstrating that abiotic stress triggers distinct epigenetic activities in diverse germplasm while also strongly supporting that a histone Kla layer of regulation is associated with physiological responses to drought stress. Interestingly, exogenous application of spermidine improved the drought tolerance of B73 and substantially altered the levels of lactate, protein lactylation, and histone Kla modification. Thus, beyond extending the known domain of Kla-based biochemical and epigenetic regulation from animal immunity to plant stress physiology, our study suggests the physiological, biochemical, and genetic function of ""the best-known metabolic waste"", lactate."
37286026,response to heavy metals,Hydrogen sulfide alleviates chromium toxicity by promoting chromium sequestration and re-establishing redox homeostasis in Zea mays L,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a multifunctional gaseous signaling molecule involved in the regulation of Cr stress responses. In the present study, we combined transcriptomic and physiological analyses to elucidate the mechanism underlying the mitigation of Cr toxicity by H2S in maize (Zea mays L.). We showed that treatment with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) partially alleviated Cr-induced growth inhibition. However, Cr uptake was not affected. RNA sequencing suggested that H2S regulates the expression of many genes involved in pectin biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and redox homeostasis. Under Cr stress, NaHS treatment significantly increased pectin content and pectin methylesterase activity; thus, more Cr was retained in the cell wall. NaHS application also increased the content of glutathione and phytochelatin, which chelate Cr and transport it into vacuoles for sequestration. Furthermore, NaHS treatment mitigated Cr-induced oxidative stress by enhancing the capacity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Overall, our results strongly support that H2S alleviates Cr toxicity in maize by promoting Cr sequestration and re-establishing redox homeostasis rather than by reducing Cr uptake from the environment."
37290549,Abiotic stress response,Functions of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs) in the regulation of plant growth and development: A comprehensive review.,"Transcription factors play important roles in governing plant responses upon changes in their ambient conditions. Any fluctuation in the supply of critical requirements for plants, such as optimum light, temperature, and water leads to the reprogramming of gene-signaling pathways. At the same time, plants also evaluate and shift their metabolism according to the various stages of development. Phytochrome-Interacting Factors are one of the most important classes of transcription factors that regulate both developmental and external stimuli-based growth of plants. This review focuses on the identification of PIFs in various organisms, regulation of PIFs by various proteins, functions of PIFs of Arabidopsis in diverse developmental pathways such as seed germination, photomorphogenesis, flowering, senescence, seed and fruit development, and external stimuli-induced plant responses such as shade avoidance response, thermomorphogenesis, and various abiotic stress responses. Recent advances related to the functional characterization of PIFs of crops such as rice, maize, and tomato have also been incorporated in this review, to ascertain the potential of PIFs as key regulators to enhance the agronomic traits of these crops. Thus, an attempt has been made to provide a holistic view of the function of PIFs in various processes in plants."
37293701,cuticular lipids; response to Fusarium ear rot,Genetic variation in ZmWAX2 confers maize resistance to Fusarium verticillioides.,"Fusarium verticillioides (F. verticillioides) is a widely distributed phytopathogen that incites multiple destructive diseases in maize, posing a grave threat to corn yields and quality worldwide. However, there are few reports of resistance genes to F. verticillioides. Here, we reveal that a combination of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to ZmWAX2 gene associates with quantitative resistance variations to F. verticillioides in maize through a genome-wide association study. A lack of ZmWAX2 compromises maize resistance to F. verticillioides-caused seed rot, seedling blight and stalk rot by reducing cuticular wax deposition, while the transgenic plants overexpressing ZmWAX2 show significantly increased immunity to F. verticillioides. A natural occurrence of two 7-bp deletions within the promoter increases ZmWAX2 transcription, thus enhancing maize resistance to F. verticillioides. Upon Fusarium stalk rot, ZmWAX2 greatly promotes the yield and grain quality of maize. Our studies demonstrate that ZmWAX2 confers multiple disease resistances caused by F. verticillioides and can serve as an important gene target for the development of F. verticillioides-resistant maize varieties."
37306056,haploid production,Combining multiplex gene editing and doubled haploid technology in maize.,"A major advantage of using CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing is multiplexing, that is, the simultaneous targeting of many genes. However, primary transformants typically contain hetero-allelic mutations or are genetic mosaic, while genetically stable lines that are homozygous are desired for functional analysis. Currently, a dedicated and labor-intensive effort is required to obtain such higher-order mutants through several generations of genetic crosses and genotyping. We describe the design and validation of a rapid and efficient strategy to produce lines of genetically identical plants carrying various combinations of homozygous edits, suitable for replicated analysis of phenotypical differences. This approach was achieved by combining highly multiplex gene editing in Zea mays (maize) with in vivo haploid induction and efficient in vitro generation of doubled haploid plants using embryo rescue doubling. By combining three CRISPR/Cas9 constructs that target in total 36 genes potentially involved in leaf growth, we generated an array of homozygous lines with various combinations of edits within three generations. Several genotypes show a reproducible 10% increase in leaf size, including a septuple mutant combination. We anticipate that our strategy will facilitate the study of gene families via multiplex CRISPR mutagenesis and the identification of allele combinations to improve quantitative crop traits."
37306069,inflorescence development,ZmSPL13 and ZmSPL29 act together to promote vegetative and reproductive transition in maize.,"Flowering time is a key agronomic trait determining environmental adaptation and yield potential of crops. The regulatory mechanisms of flowering in maize still remain rudimentary. In this study, we combine expressional, genetic, and molecular studies to identify two homologous SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors ZmSPL13 and ZmSPL29 as positive regulators of juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition and floral transition in maize. We show that both ZmSPL13 and ZmSPL29 are preferentially expressed in leaf phloem, vegetative and reproductive meristem. We show that vegetative phase change and flowering time are moderately delayed in the Zmspl13 and Zmspl29 single knockout mutants and more significantly delayed in the Zmspl13/29 double mutants. Consistently, the ZmSPL29 overexpression plants display precocious vegetative phase transition and floral transition, thus early flowering. We demonstrate that ZmSPL13 and ZmSPL29 directly upregulate the expression of ZmMIR172C and ZCN8 in the leaf, and of ZMM3 and ZMM4 in the shoot apical meristem, to induce juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition and floral transition. These findings establish a consecutive signaling cascade of the maize aging pathway by linking the miR156-SPL and the miR172-Gl15 regulatory modules and provide new targets for genetic improvement of flowering time in maize cultivars."
37309374,response to Puccinia polysora,Introgression of the RppQ gene from field corn improves southern rust resistance in sweet corn.,"Southern rust, one of the most destructive foliar diseases of sweet corn (Zea mays convar. saccharata var. rugosa), is caused by Puccinia polysora Underw. and leads to enormous yield losses and reduced quality of sweet corn in China. Utilization of resistance genes is an effective and environmentally friendly strategy for improving southern rust resistance of sweet corn. However, improvement is hampered by a lack of resistance genes in Chinese sweet corn germplasm. In this study, we introgress the southern rust resistance gene RppQ from Qi319, an inbred line of southern rust-resistant field corn, into four elite sweet corn inbred lines (1401, 1413, 1434, and 1445) using marker-assisted backcross breeding. These are parental inbred lines of four popular sweet corn varieties: Yuetian 28, Yuetian 13, Yuetian 26, and Yuetian 27. We developed five RppQ-based markers (M0607, M0801, M0903, M3301, and M3402) and employed these markers for foreground selection; 92.3 to 97.9% of the recurrent parent genomes were recovered following three or four rounds of backcrossing. The four newly developed sweet corn lines all showed significant improvement of southern rust resistance compared with their respective parent lines. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in phenotypic data for agronomic traits. In addition, reconstituted hybrids derived from the converted lines retained resistance to southern rust, while other agronomic traits and sugar content remained unchanged. Our study provides an example of successful development of southern rust-resistant sweet corn using a resistance gene from field corn."
37309443,Transformation,"Maize transformation: history, progress, and perspectives.","Maize functional genomics research and genetic improvement strategies have been greatly accelerated and refined through the development and utilization of genetic transformation systems. Maize transformation is a composite technology based on decades' efforts in optimizing multiple factors involving microbiology and physical/biochemical DNA delivery, as well as cellular and molecular biology. This review provides a historical reflection on the development of maize transformation technology including the early failures and successful milestones. It also provides a current perspective on the understanding of tissue culture responses and their impact on plant regeneration, the pros and cons of different DNA delivery methods, the identification of a palette of selectable/screenable markers, and most recently the development of growth-stimulating or morphogenic genes to improve efficiencies and extend the range of transformable genotypes. Steady research progress in these interdependent components has been punctuated by benchmark reports celebrating the progress in maize transformation, which invariably relied on a large volume of supporting research that contributed to each step and to the current state of the art. The recent explosive use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing has heightened the demand for higher transformation efficiencies, especially for important inbreds, to support increasingly sophisticated and complicated genomic modifications, in a manner that is widely accessible. These trends place an urgent demand on taking maize transformation to the next level, presaging a new generation of improvements on the horizon. Once realized, we anticipate a near-future where readily accessible, genotype-independent maize transformation, together with advanced genomics, genome editing, and accelerated breeding, will contribute to world agriculture and global food security."
37309476,drought response,Genetic dissection of maize drought tolerance for trait improvement.,"Maize is one of the most important crops, but its production is threatened by drought stress worldwide. Thus, increased drought tolerance has been a major goal of maize breeding. Conventional breeding strategies have led to significantly increase of maize yields; however, these strategies often fail to meet the need for drought stress tolerance enhancement. Here, we focus on progress related to the genetic dissection of drought tolerance in maize at different developmental stages achieved through linkage mapping and association mapping. Moreover, recent molecular breeding systems, including transgenic, genome-wide marker-assisted selection, and genome editing technologies, have provided a more direct, efficient, and accurate approach for trait improvement. We also provide perspectives on future directions regarding multi-omics studies and maize improvement. Overall, the application of acquired knowledge will facilitate maize breeding to meet the challenges."
37309541,leaf angle,Genome-wide association studies of leaf angle in maize.,"Compact plant-type with small leaf angle has increased canopy light interception, which is conducive to the photosynthesis of the population and higher population yield at high density planting in maize. In this study, a panel of 285 diverse maize inbred lines genotyped with 56,000 SNPs was used to investigate the genetic basis of leaf angle across 3 consecutive years using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The leaf angle showed broad phenotypic variation and high heritability across different years. Population structure analysis subdivided the panel into four subgroups that correspond to the four major empirical germplasm origins in China, i.e., Tangsipingtou, Reid, Lancaster and P. When tested with the optimal GWAS model, we found that the Q + K model was the best in reducing false positive. In total, 96 SNPs accounting for 5.54-10.44% of phenotypic variation were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with leaf angle across three years. According to the linkage disequilibrium decay distance, 96 SNPs were binned into 43 QTLs for leaf angle. Seven major QTLs with R2 > 8% stably detected in at least 2 years, and BLUP values were clustered in four genomic regions (bins 2.01, 2.07, 5.06, and 10.04). Seven important candidate genes, Zm00001d001961, Zm00001d006348, Zm00001d006463, Zm00001d017618, Zm00001d024919, Zm00001d025018, and Zm00001d025033 were predicted for the seven stable major QTLs, respectively. The markers identified in this study can be used for molecular breeding for leaf angle, and the candidate genes would contribute to further understanding of the genetic basis of leaf angle.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11032-021-01241-0."
37312866,grain moisture,Genome-wide association analysis for grain moisture content and dehydration rate on maize hybrids.,"For mechanized maize production, a low grain water content (GWC) at harvest is necessary. However, as a complex quantitative trait, understand the genetic mechanism of GWC remains a large gap, especially in hybrids. In this study, a hybrid population through two environments including 442 F1 was used for genome-wide association analysis of GWC and the grain dehydration rate (GDR), using the area under the dry down curve (AUDDC) as the index. Then, we identified 19 and 17 associated SNPs for GWC and AUDDC, including 10 co-localized SNPs, along with 64 and 77 pairs of epistatic SNPs for GWC and AUDDC, respectively. These loci could explain 11.39-68.2% of the total phenotypic variation for GWC and 41.07-67.02% for AUDDC at different stages, whose major effect was the additive and epistatic effect. By exploring the candidate genes around the significant sites, a total of 398 and 457 possible protein-coding genes were screened, including autophagy pathway and auxin regulation-related genes, and five inbred lines with the potential to reduce GWC in the combined F1 hybrid were identified. Our research not only provides a certain reference for the genetic mechanism analysis of GWC in hybrids but also provides an added reference for breeding low-GWC materials."
37313300,grain quality,Genome-wide association analysis of kernel nutritional quality in two natural maize populations.,"As one of the three staple crops, nutritional traits in maize are important for human and animal nutrition. Grain quality-related traits are closely related to grain commercial value. Understanding the genetic basis of quality-related traits in maize would be helpful for breeding high-quality maize varieties. In this study, two association panels (AM122 and AM180) were subjected to genome-wide association analysis of grain quality-related traits, including protein content, oil content, starch content, and fiber content. In total, 98 SNPs (P < 1 × 10-4) were identified to be significantly associated with these four grain quality-related traits. By integrating two sets of public transcriptome data, 31 genes located in 200 kb regions flanking the associated SNP showed high expression during kernel development and were differentially expressed in two maize inbred lines, KA225 and KB035, with significantly different quality. These genes might regulate maize grain quality by participating in plant hormone processes, autophagy processes, and others. All these results could provide important reference information for breeding high‑quality maize varieties."
37315361,mycorrhizal infection; response to heavy metals,"Multiomics reveals Claroideoglomus etunicatum regulates plant hormone signal transduction, photosynthesis and La compartmentalization in maize to promote growth under La stress.","Rare earth elements (REEs) have been widely used in traditional and high-tech fields, and high doses of REEs are considered a risk to the ecosystem. Although the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in promoting host resistance to heavy metal (HM) stress has been well documented, the molecular mechanism by which AMF symbiosis enhances plant tolerance to REEs is still unclear. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism by which the AMF Claroideoglomus etunicatum promotes maize (Zea mays) seedling tolerance to lanthanum (La) stress (100 mg·kg-1 La). C. etunicatum symbiosis significantly improved maize seedling growth, P and La uptake and photosynthesis. Transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses performed alone and together revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to auxin /indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA) and the DEGs and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) related to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (Nramp6), vacuoles and vesicles were upregulated. In contrast, photosynthesis-related DEGs and DEPs were downregulated, and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) was more abundant under C. etunicatum symbiosis. C. etunicatum symbiosis can promote plant growth by increasing P uptake, regulating plant hormone signal transduction, photosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways and enhancing La transport and compartmentalization in vacuoles and vesicles. The results provide new insights into the promotion of plant REE tolerance by AMF symbiosis and the possibility of utilizing AMF-maize interactions in REE phytoremediation and recycling."
37324707,haploid production,Popcorn (Zea mays L. var. Everta) haploids identified by Navajo phenotype and ploidy level.,"For popcorn, obtaining and identifying haploids are still challenging steps. We aimed to induce and screen haploids in popcorn using the Navajo phenotype, seedling vigor, and ploidy level. We used the Krasnodar Haploid Inducer (KHI) in crosses with 20 popcorn source germplasms and five maize controls. The field trial design was completely randomized, with three replications. We assessed the efficacy of induction and identification of haploids based on the haploidy induction rate (HIR) and false positive and negative rates (FPR and FNR). Additionally, we also measured the penetrance of the Navajo marker gene (R1-nj). All putative haploids classified by the R1-nj were germinated together with a diploid sample and evaluated for false positives and negatives based on vigor. Seedlings from 14 females were submitted to flow cytometry to determine the ploidy level. The HIR and penetrance were analyzed by fitting a generalized linear model with a logit link function. The HIR of the KHI, adjusted by cytometry, ranged from 0.0 to 1.2%, with a mean of 0.34%. The average FPR from screening based on the Navajo phenotype was 26.2% and 76.4% for vigor and ploidy, respectively. The FNR was zero. The penetrance of R1-nj ranged from 30.8 to 98.6%. The average number of seeds per ear in temperate germplasm (76) was lower than that obtained in tropical germplasm (98). There is an induction of haploids in germplasm of tropical and temperate origin. We recommend the selection of haploids associated with the Navajo phenotype with a direct method of confirming the ploidy level, such as flow cytometry. We also show that haploid screening based on Navajo phenotype and seedling vigor reduces misclassification. The origin and genetic background of the source germplasm influence the R1-nj penetrance. Because the known inducers are maize, developing doubled haploid technology for popcorn hybrid breeding requires overcoming unilateral cross-incompatibility."
37326336,response to salt,ZmEREB57 regulates OPDA synthesis and enhances salt stress tolerance through two distinct signalling pathways in Zea mays.,"In plant, APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF)-domain transcription factors are important in regulating abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, ZmEREB57 encoding a AP2/ERF transcription factor was identified and its function was investigated in maize. ZmEREB57 is a nuclear protein with transactivation activity induced by several abiotic stress types. Furthermore, two CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lines of ZmEREB57 showed enhanced sensitivity to saline conditions, whereas the overexpression of ZmEREB57 increased salt tolerance in maize and Arabidopsis. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) analysis revealed that ZmEREB57 notably regulates target genes by binding to promoters containing an O-box-like motif (CCGGCC). ZmEREB57 directly binds to the promoter of ZmAOC2 involved in the synthesis of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes involved in regulating stress and redox homeostasis showed differential expression patterns in OPDA- and JA-treated maize seedlings exposed to salt stress compared to those treated with salt stress alone. Analysis of mutants deficient in the biosynthesis of OPDA and JA revealed that OPDA functions as a signalling molecule in the salt response. Our results indicate that ZmEREB57 involves in salt tolerance by regulating OPDA and JA signalling and confirm early observations that OPDA signalling functions independently of JA signalling."
37331633,male fertility; foliar senescence,The NAC transcription factor ZmNAC132 regulates leaf senescence and male fertility in maize,"Leaf senescence is an integral step in the final stages of plant development, as nutrient remobilization from leaves to sink organs is accomplished during this process. NACs compose a large superfamily of plant-specific TFs involved in multiple plant development processes. Here, we identified a maize NAC TF, ZmNAC132, involved in leaf senescence and male fertility. ZmNAC132 expression was tightly linked to leaf senescence in an age-dependent manner. Knockout of ZmNAC132 led to delays in chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence, whereas overexpression of ZmNAC132 had the opposite effects. ZmNAC132 could bind to and transactivate the promoter of ZmNYE1, a major chlorophyll catabolic gene, to accelerate chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence. Moreover, ZmNAC132 affected male fertility through the upregulation of ZmEXPB1, an expansin-encoding gene associated with sexual reproduction and other related genes. Together, the results show that ZmNAC132 participates in the regulation of leaf senescence and male fertility through the targeting of different downstream genes in maize."
37336378,response to Colletotrichum graminicola,CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of large chromosomal segments identifies a minichromosome modulating the Colletotrichum graminicola virulence on maize.,"Colletotrichum graminicola causes anthracnose on maize, an economically significant disease worldwide. To decipher how the pathogen controls its virulence/pathogenicity on maize at the minichromosomal level, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of the C. graminicola strain T1-3-3. The 61.91 Mb genome contains three transcriptionally repressed, full-length strain-specific minichromosomes (<1 Mb; Chr11 through Chr13). A CRISPR/Cas9-based system was developed to knock out large chromosomal segments; it involved the generation of multiple simultaneous DNA double-strand breaks across a targeted genomic region, followed by homology-directed replacement thereof with a donor DNA template carrying the selectable marker gene Hpt flanked by homologous sequence arms of the targeted region. Using this system, we obtained distinct mutants functionally nullisomic for individual minichromosomes. Only the ΔChr12 mutant lacking the 498.44 Kb genomic region carrying all of the 31 genes of Chr12 exhibited attenuated virulence on maize and was indistinguishable from T1-3-3 in fungal growth and conidiation, indicating that Chr12 is a conditionally dispensable minichromosome. The conditionally dispensable minichromosome Chr12 imparts full virulence to C. graminicola on maize. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system developed in this study will enable the determination of the biological functions of minichromosomes or large chromosomal segments in fungal plant pathogens."
37339931,disease response,"Combination of transcriptomic, proteomic and degradomic profiling reveals common and distinct patterns of pathogen-induced cell death in maize.","Regulated cell death (RCD) is crucial for plant development, as well as in decision-making in plant-microbe interactions. Previous studies revealed components of the molecular network controlling RCD, including different proteases. However, the identity, the proteolytic network as well as molecular components involved in the initiation and execution of distinct plant RCD processes, still remain largely elusive. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome, proteome and N-terminome of Zea mays leaves treated with the Xanthomonas effector avrRxo1, the mycotoxin Fumonisin B1 (FB1), or the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) to dissect plant cellular processes related to cell death and plant immunity. We found highly distinct and time-dependent biological processes being activated on transcriptional and proteome levels in response to avrRxo1, FB1 and SA. A correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome identified general, as well as trigger-specific markers for cell death in Z. mays. We found that proteases, particularly papain-like cysteine proteases, are specifically regulated during RCD. Collectivley, this study characterizes distinct RCD responses in Z. mays and provides a framework for the mechanistic exploration of components involved in the initiation and execution of cell death."
37341033,pollen shedding degree,ZmRPN1 confers quantitative variation in pollen number and boosts hybrid seed production in maize.,"The number of pollen grains is a critical determinant of reproductive success in seed plants and varies among species and individuals. However, in contrast with many mutant-screening studies relevant to anther and pollen development, the natural genetic basis for variations in pollen number remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we carried out a genome-wide association study in maize, ultimately revealing that a large presence/absence variation in the promoter region of ZmRPN1 alters its expression level and thereby contributes to pollen number variation. Molecular analyses showed that ZmRPN1 interacts with ZmMSP1, which is known as a germline cell number regulator, and facilitates ZmMSP1 localization to the plasma membrane. Importantly, ZmRPN1 dysfunction resulted in a substantial increase in pollen number, consequently boosting seed production by increasing female-male planting ratio. Together, our findings uncover a key gene controlling pollen number, and therefore, modulation of ZmRPN1 expression could be efficiently used to develop elite pollinators for modern hybrid maize breeding."
37341790,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,ZmAGO18b negatively regulates maize resistance against southern leaf blight.,"Here, we report that ZmAGO18b encoding an argonaute protein is a negative regulator of maize resistance against southern leaf blight. Southern leaf blight caused by fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus is a destructive disease on maize throughout the world. Argonaute (AGO) proteins, key regulators in small RNA pathway, play important roles in plant defense. But whether they have function in maize resistance against C. heterostrophus is unknown. Association analysis between the nucleic variation of 18 ZmAGO loci with disease phenotype against C. heterostrophus was performed, and the ZmAGO18b locus was identified to be associated with resistance against C. heterostrophus. Overexpression of ZmAGO18b gene suppresses maize resistance against C. heterostrophus, and mutation of ZmAGO18b enhances maize resistance against C. heterostrophus. Further, we identified the resistant haplotype of ZmAGO18b by association analysis of natural variation in ZmAGO18b genomic DNA sequences with seedling resistance phenotypes against C. heterostrophus and confirmed the resistant haplotype is co-segregated with resistance phenotypes against C. heterostrophus in two F2 populations. In sum, this study reports that ZmAGO18b negatively regulates maize resistance against C. heterostrophus."
37346683,kernel type,Recognition of maize seed varieties based on hyperspectral imaging technology and integrated learning algorithms.,"Purity is an important factor of maize seed quality that affects yield, and traditional seed purity identification methods are costly or time-consuming. To achieve rapid and accurate detection of the purity of maize seeds, a method for identifying maize seed varieties, using random subspace integrated learning and hyperspectral imaging technology, was proposed. A hyperspectral image of the maize seed endosperm was collected to obtain a spectral image cube with a wavelength range of 400∼1,000 nm. Methods, including Standard Normal Variate (SNV), multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC), and Savitzky-Golay First Derivative (SG1) were used to preprocess raw spectral data. Iteratively retains informative variables (IRIV) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) were used to reduce the dimensions of the spectral data. A recognition model of maize seed varieties was established using k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), line discrimination analysis (LDA) and decision tree (DT). Among the preprocessing methods, MSC has the best effect. Among the dimensionality reduction methods, IRIV has the best performance. Among the base classifiers, LDA had the highest precision. To improve the precision in identifying maize seed varieties, LDA was used as the base classifier to establish a random subspace ensemble learning (RSEL) model. Using MSC-IRIV-RSEL, precision increased from 0.9333 to 0.9556, and the Kappa coefficient increased from 0.9174 to 0.9457. This study shows that the method based on hyperspectral imaging technology combined with subspace ensemble learning algorithm is a new method for maize seed purity recognition."
37348450,response to flooding; root morphology,Ethylene enhanced waterlogging tolerance by changing root architecture and inducing aerenchyma formation in maize seedlings,"Waterlogging negatively affects maize growth and yield. In this study, we found that ethylene played a vital role in plant adaptation to waterlogging. ET promotes better growth in seedlings under waterlogging conditions by altering root architecture and increasing lateral root formation by 42.1%. What's more, plants with high endogenous ethylene levels exhibited reduced sensitivity to waterlogging stress. ET also induced the formation of aerenchyma, a specialized tissue that facilitates gas exchange, in a different pattern compared to aerenchyma formed under waterlogging. Aerenchyma induced by ET was mainly located in the medial cortex of the roots and was not prone to decay. ethylene inhibited root elongation under normal conditions, but this inhibition was not alleviated under waterlogging stress. Upon activation of the ET signaling pathway, the transcription factor EREB90 promoted aerenchyma formation by enhancing the programmed cell death process. Overexpression of EREB90 resulted in increased waterlogging tolerance compared to wild type plants. Our findings suggest that pre-treatment of maize seedlings with ET before waterlogging stress can trigger the programmed cell death process and induce aerenchyma formation, thus improving waterlogging resistance."
37349934,response to Fusarium stalk rot,Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles reveal cell type-specific transcriptional regulation networks conditioning fungal invasion in maize roots.,"Stalk rot caused by Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) is one of the most destructive diseases in maize production. The defence response of root system to Fv invasion is important for plant growth and development. Dissection of root cell type-specific response to Fv infection and its underlying transcription regulatory networks will aid in understanding the defence mechanism of maize roots to Fv invasion. Here, we reported the transcriptomes of 29 217 single cells derived from root tips of two maize inbred lines inoculated with Fv and mock condition, and identified seven major cell types with 21 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. Through the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified 12 Fv-responsive regulatory modules from 4049 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were activated or repressed by Fv infection in these seven cell types. Using a machining-learning approach, we constructed six cell type-specific immune regulatory networks by integrating Fv-induced DEGs from the cell type-specific transcriptomes, 16 known maize disease-resistant genes, five experimentally validated genes (ZmWOX5b, ZmPIN1a, ZmPAL6, ZmCCoAOMT2, and ZmCOMT), and 42 QTL or QTN predicted genes that are associated with Fv resistance. Taken together, this study provides not only a global view of maize cell fate determination during root development but also insights into the immune regulatory networks in major cell types of maize root tips at single-cell resolution, thus laying the foundation for dissecting molecular mechanisms underlying disease resistance in maize."
37350263,inter-vein distance ,A rapid method to quantify vein density in C4 plants using starch staining.,"C4 photosynthesis has evolved multiple times in the angiosperms and typically involves alterations to the biochemistry, cell biology and development of leaves. One common modification found in C4 plants compared with the ancestral C3 state is an increase in vein density such that the leaf contains a larger proportion of bundle sheath cells. Recent findings indicate that there may be significant intraspecific variation in traits such as vein density in C4 plants but to use such natural variation for trait-mapping, rapid phenotyping would be required. Here we report a high-throughput method to quantify vein density that leverages the bundle sheath-specific accumulation of starch found in C4 species. Starch staining allowed high-contrast images to be acquired permitting image analysis with MATLAB- and Python-based programmes. The method works for dicotyledons and monocotolydons. We applied this method to Gynandropsis gynandra where significant variation in vein density was detected between natural accessions, and Zea mays where no variation was apparent in the genotypically diverse lines assessed. We anticipate this approach will be useful to map genes controlling vein density in C4 species demonstrating natural variation for this trait."
37351221,tassel development; kernel number per ear; response to heat stress,Heat stress affects tassel development and reduces the kernel number of summer maize.,"Maize grain yield is drastically reduced by heat stress (HTS) during anthesis and early grain filling. However, the mechanism of HTS in reproductive organs and kernel numbers remains poorly understood. From 2018 to 2020, two maize varieties (ND372, heat tolerant; and XY335, heat sensitive) and two temperature regimens (HTS, heat stress; and CK, natural control) were evaluated, resulting in four treatments (372CK, 372HTS, 335CK, and 335HTS). HTS was applied from the nine-leaf stage (V9) to the anthesis stage. Various morphological traits and physiological activities of the tassels, anthers, and pollen from the two varieties were evaluated to determine their correlation with kernel count. The results showed that HTS reduced the number of florets, tassel volume, and tassel length, but increased the number of tassel branches. HTS accelerates tassel degradation and reduces pollen weight, quantity, and viability. Deformation and reduction in length and volume due to HTS were observed in both the Nongda 372 (ND372) and Xianyu 335 (XY335) varieties, with the average reductions being 22.9% and 35.2%, respectively. The morphology of the anthers changed more conspicuously in XY335 maize. The number of kernels per spike was reduced in the HTS group compared with the CK group, with the ND372 and XY335 varieties showing reductions of 47.3% and 59.3%, respectively. The main factors underlying the decrease in yield caused by HTS were reductions in pollen quantity and weight, tassel rachis, and branch length. HTS had a greater effect on the anther shape, pollen viability, and phenotype of XY335 than on those of ND372. HTS had a greater impact on anther morphology, pollen viability, and the phenotype of XY335 but had no influence on the appearance or dissemination of pollen from tassel."
37368984,days to flowering,Enhancing adaptation of tropical maize to temperate environments using genomic selection.,"Tropical maize can be used to diversify the genetic base of temperate germplasm and help create climate-adapted cultivars. However, tropical maize is unadapted to temperate environments, in which sensitivities to long photoperiods and cooler temperatures result in severely delayed flowering times, developmental defects, and little to no yield. Overcoming this maladaptive syndrome can require a decade of phenotypic selection in a targeted, temperate environment. To accelerate the incorporation of tropical diversity in temperate breeding pools, we tested if an additional generation of genomic selection can be used in an off-season nursery where phenotypic selection is not very effective. Prediction models were trained using flowering time recorded on random individuals in separate lineages of a heterogenous population grown at two northern U.S. latitudes. Direct phenotypic selection and genomic prediction model training was performed within each target environment and lineage, followed by genomic prediction of random intermated progenies in the off-season nursery. Performance of genomic prediction models was evaluated on self-fertilized progenies of prediction candidates grown in both target locations in the following summer season. Prediction abilities ranged from 0.30 to 0.40 among populations and evaluation environments. Prediction models with varying marker effect distributions or spatial field effects had similar accuracies. Our results suggest that genomic selection in a single off-season generation could increase genetic gains for flowering time by more than 50% compared to direct selection in summer seasons only, reducing the time required to change the population mean to an acceptably adapted flowering time by about one-third to one-half."
37372375,pigmentation; kernel type,Efficiency of Biological Typing Methods in Maize Hybrid Genetic Purity Estimation.,"A high level of genetic purity in crop varieties must be achieved and maintained for agronomic performance, encouraging investment and innovation in plant breeding and ensuring that the improvements in productivity and quality imparted by breeders are delivered to the consumer. Since the success of hybrid seed production is dependent upon the genetic purity of the parental lines, in this study, the experimental F1exp maize hybrid and its parental inbreeds were used as a model system to examine the discriminative power of morphological, biochemical and SSR markers for seed purity assay. The highest number of off-type plants was estimated by morphological markers. According to the comparison of prolamins and albumins banding patterns of parental and derived F1exp seeds, genetic impurities could not be detected. Molecular analysis detected two types of genetic profile irregularity. Beside its use for verifying varieties of maize, report on umc1545 primer pair ability to detect non-specific bands (i.e., off-types), in both the maternal component and F1exp, which is the first report on this issue yet, strongly supports the recommendation of this SSR marker use for more accurate and time-efficient maize hybrids and parental lines genetic pyrity testing."
37373152,response to Pantoea ananatis,"Integrated IBD Analysis, GWAS Analysis and Transcriptome Analysis to Identify the Candidate Genes for White Spot Disease in Maize","Foundation parents (FPs) play an irreplaceable role in maize breeding practices. Maize white spot (MWS) is an important disease in Southwest China that always seriously reduces production. However, knowledge about the genetic mechanism of MWS resistance is limited. In this paper, a panel of 143 elite lines were collected and genotyped by using the MaizeSNP50 chip with approximately 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and evaluated for resistance to MWS among 3 environments, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome analysis were integrated to reveal the function of the identity-by-descent (IBD) segments for MWS. The results showed that (1) 225 IBD segments were identified only in the FP QB512, 192 were found only in the FP QR273 and 197 were found only in the FP HCL645. (2) The GWAS results showed that 15 common quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were associated with MWS. Interestingly, SYN10137 and PZA00131.14 were in the IBD segments of QB512, and the SYN10137-PZA00131.14 region existed in more than 58% of QR273′s descendants. (3) By integrating the GWAS and transcriptome analysis, Zm00001d031875 was found to located in the region of SYN10137-PZA00131.14. These results provide some new insights for the detection of MWS’s genetic variation mechanisms."
37375981,response to salt,Research Progress on the Mechanism of Salt Tolerance in Maize: A Classic Field That Needs New Efforts.,"Maize is the most important cereal crop globally. However, in recent years, maize production faced numerous challenges from environmental factors due to the changing climate. Salt stress is among the major environmental factors that negatively impact crop productivity worldwide. To cope with salt stress, plants developed various strategies, such as producing osmolytes, increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, maintaining reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and regulating ion transport. This review provides an overview of the intricate relationships between salt stress and several plant defense mechanisms, including osmolytes, antioxidant enzymes, reactive oxygen species, plant hormones, and ions (Na+, K+, Cl-), which are critical for salt tolerance in maize. It addresses the regulatory strategies and key factors involved in salt tolerance, aiming to foster a comprehensive understanding of the salt tolerance regulatory networks in maize. These new insights will also pave the way for further investigations into the significance of these regulations in elucidating how maize coordinates its defense system to resist salt stress."
37377813,leaf angle,Molecular and functional dissection of LIGULELESS1 (LG1) in plants.,"Plant architecture is a culmination of the features necessary for capturing light energy and adapting to the environment. An ideal architecture can promote an increase in planting density, light penetration to the lower canopy, airflow as well as heat distribution to achieve an increase in crop yield. A number of plant architecture-related genes have been identified by map cloning, quantitative trait locus (QTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. LIGULELESS1 (LG1) belongs to the squamosa promoter-binding protein (SBP) family of transcription factors (TFs) that are key regulators for plant growth and development, especially leaf angle (LA) and flower development. The DRL1/2-LG1-RAVL pathway is involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling to regulate the LA in maize, which has facilitated the regulation of plant architecture. Therefore, exploring the gene regulatory functions of LG1, especially its relationship with LA genes, can help achieve the precise regulation of plant phenotypes adapted to varied environments, thereby increasing the yield. This review comprehensively summarizes the advances in LG1 research, including its effect on LA and flower development. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future research goals associate with LG1."
37403650,drought response,IQ domain-containing protein ZmIQD27 modulates water transport in maize.,"Plant metaxylem vessels provide physical support to promote upright growth and the transport of water and nutrients. A detailed characterization of the molecular network controlling metaxylem development is lacking. However, knowledge of the events that regulate metaxylem development could contribute to the development of germplasm with improved yield. In this paper, we screened an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced B73 mutant library, which covers 92% of maize (Zea mays) genes, to identify drought-sensitive phenotypes. Three mutants were identified, named iqd27-1, iqd27-2, and iqd27-3, and genetic crosses showed that they were allelic to each other. The causal gene in these three mutants encodes the IQ domain-containing protein ZmIQD27. Our study showed that defective metaxylem vessel development likely causes the drought sensitivity and abnormal water transport phenotypes in the iqd27 mutants. ZmIQD27 was expressed in the root meristematic zone where secondary cell wall deposition is initiated, and loss-of-function iqd27 mutants exhibited a microtubular arrangement disorder. We propose that association of functional ZmIQD27 with microtubules is essential for correct targeted deposition of the building blocks for secondary cell wall development in maize."
37410701,response to heat stress,A genetic tradeoff for tolerance to moderate and severe heat stress in US hybrid maize,"Global climate change is increasing both average temperatures and the frequencies of extreme high temperatures. Past studies have documented a strong negative effect of exposures to temperatures >30°C on hybrid maize yields. However, these studies could not disentangle genetic adaptation via artificial selection from changes in agronomic practices. Because most of the earliest maize hybrids are no longer available, side-by-side comparisons with modern hybrids under current field conditions are generally impossible. Here, we report on the collection and curation of 81 years of public yield trial records covering 4,730 maize hybrids, which enabled us to model genetic variation for temperature responses among maize hybrids. We show that selection may have indirectly and inconsistently contributed to the genetic adaptation of maize to moderate heat stress over this time period while preserving genetic variance for continued adaptation. However, our results reveal the existence of a genetic tradeoff for tolerance to moderate and severe heat stress, leading to a decrease in tolerance to severe heat stress over the same time period. Both trends are particularly conspicuous since the mid-1970s. Such a tradeoff poses challenges to the continued adaptation of maize to warming climates due to a projected increase in the frequency of extreme heat events. Nevertheless, given recent advances in phenomics, enviromics, and physiological modeling, our results offer a degree of optimism for the capacity of plant breeders to adapt maize to warming climates, assuming appropriate levels of R&D investment. Author summary: As climate change increases average temperatures, the heat tolerance of major crops becomes more important to global food security. Past studies in maize have documented strongly negative effects of heat stress on maize yields but without adequate characterization of changes to heat tolerance over time. In this study, we explored changes in maize heat tolerance over the past 80 years of hybrid maize breeding using data from public yield trials. We showed that tolerance to moderate heat stress has increased, but that tolerance to severe heat stress has decreased. Because climate change is expected to increase the incidence of severe heat stress in particular, these findings indicate the need for more detailed genetic and physiological studies of heat tolerance and their incorporation into plant breeding efforts. They also highlight the past successes of plant breeders at adapting maize to moderate heat stress. Overall, our findings suggest directions for further research to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and a tempered optimism for their application."
37429215,response to cold stress,Comprehensive analysis of transcriptional data on seed germination of two maize inbred lines under low-temperature conditions.,"Seed germination directly affect maize yield and grain quality. Low-temperature reduces maize yield by affecting seed germination and seedling growth. However, the molecular mechanism of maize seed germination under low-temperature remains unclear. In this study, the transcriptome data of two maize inbred lines SCL127 (chilling-sensitive) and SCL326 (chilling-tolerant) were analyzed at five time points (0 H, 4 H, 12 H, 24 H, and 48 H) under low-temperature conditions. Through the comparison of SCL127-0 H-vs-SCL326-0 H (Group I), SCL127-4 H-vs-SCL326-4 H (Group Ⅱ), SCL127-12 H-vs-SCL326-12 H (Group Ⅲ), SCL127-24 H-vs-SCL326-24 H (Group Ⅳ), and SCL127-48 H-vs SCL326-48 H (Group Ⅴ), a total of 8,526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Weighted correlation network analysis revealed that Zm00001d010445 was the hub gene involved in seed germination under low-temperature conditions. Zm00001d010445-based association analysis showed that Hap Ⅱ (G) was the excellent haplotype for seed germination under low-temperature conditions. These findings provide a new perspective for the study of the genetic architecture of maize tolerance to low-temperature and contribute to the cultivation of maize varieties with low-temperature tolerance."
37430212,photosynthetic efficiency; chlorophyll content,Genetic dissection of maize (Zea mays L.) chlorophyll content using multi-locus genome-wide association studies.,"Background: The chlorophyll content (CC) is a key factor affecting maize photosynthetic efficiency and the final yield. However, its genetic basis remains unclear. The development of statistical methods has enabled researchers to design and apply various GWAS models, including MLM, MLMM, SUPER, FarmCPU, BLINK and 3VmrMLM. Comparative analysis of their results can lead to more effective mining of key genes. Results: The heritability of CC was 0.86. Six statistical models (MLM, BLINK, MLMM, FarmCPU, SUPER, and 3VmrMLM) and 1.25 million SNPs were used for the GWAS. A total of 140 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were detected, with 3VmrMLM and MLM detecting the most (118) and fewest (3) QTNs, respectively. The QTNs were associated with 481 genes and explained 0.29-10.28% of the phenotypic variation. Additionally, 10 co-located QTNs were detected by at least two different models or methods, three co-located QTNs were identified in at least two different environments, and six co-located QTNs were detected by different models or methods in different environments. Moreover, 69 candidate genes within or near these stable QTNs were screened based on the B73 (RefGen_v2) genome. GRMZM2G110408 (ZmCCS3) was identified by multiple models and in multiple environments. The functional characterization of this gene indicated the encoded protein likely contributes to chlorophyll biosynthesis. In addition, the CC differed significantly between the haplotypes of the significant QTN in this gene, and CC was higher for haplotype 1. Conclusion: This study's results broaden our understanding of the genetic basis of CC, mining key genes related to CC and may be relevant for the ideotype-based breeding of new maize varieties with high photosynthetic efficiency."
37434355,response to fall armyworm,"9,10-KODA, an α-ketol produced by the tonoplast-localized 9-lipoxygenase ZmLOX5, plays a signaling role in maize defense against insect herbivory.","13-lipoxygenases (LOXs) initiate the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), the best-understood oxylipin hormone in herbivory defense. However, the roles of 9-LOX-derived oxylipins in insect resistance remain unclear. Here, we report a novel anti-herbivory mechanism mediated by a tonoplast-localized 9-LOX, ZmLOX5, and its linolenic acid-derived product, 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9,10-KODA). Transposon-insertional disruption of ZmLOX5 resulted in the loss of resistance to insect herbivory. lox5 knock-out mutants displayed greatly reduced wound-induced accumulation of multiple oxylipins and defense metabolites, including benzoxazinoids, abscisic acid (ABA) and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile). However, exogenous JA-Ile failed to rescue insect defense in lox5 mutants, while applications of 1 μM 9,10-KODA or the JA precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA), restored wild-type resistance levels. Metabolite profiling revealed that exogenous 9,10-KODA primed the plants for increased production of ABA and 12-OPDA, but not JA-Ile. While none of the 9-oxylipins were able to rescue JA-Ile induction, the lox5 mutant accumulated lower wound-induced levels of Ca2+,suggesting this as a potential explanation for lower wound-induced JA. Seedlings pretreated with 9,10-KODA exhibited rapid or more robust wound-induced defense gene expression. In addition, an artificial diet supplemented with 9,10-KODA arrested fall armyworm larvae growth. Finally, analysis of single and double lox5 and lox10 mutants showed that ZmLOX5 also contributed to insect defense by modulating ZmLOX10-mediated green leaf volatile signaling. Our study uncovered a previously unknown antiherbivore defense and hormone-like signaling activity for a major 9-oxylipin α-ketol."
37440932,tassel development,Genetic evidence that brassinosteroids suppress pistils in the maize tassel independent of the jasmonic acid pathway,"The developmental genetics of reproductive structure control in maize must consider both the staminate florets of the tassel and the pistillate florets of the ear synflorescences. Pistil abortion takes place in the tassel florets, and stamen arrest is affected in ear florets to give rise to the monoecious nature of maize. Gibberellin (GA) deficiency results in increased tillering, a dwarfed plant syndrome, and the retention of anthers in the ear florets of maize. The silkless1 mutant results in suppression of silks in the ear. We demonstrate in this study that jasmonic acid (JA) and GA act independently and show additive phenotypes resulting in androecious dwarf1;silkless1 double mutant plants. The persistence of pistils in the tassel can be induced by multiple mechanisms, including JA deficiency, GA excess, genetic control of floral determinacy, and organ identity. The silkless1 mutant can suppress both silks in the ear and the silks in the tassel of JA-deficient and AP2 transcription factor tasselseed mutants. We previously demonstrated that GA production was required for brassinosteroid (BR) deficiency to affect persistence of pistils in the tassel. We find that BR deficiency affects pistil persistence by an independent mechanism from the silkless1 mutant and JA pathway. The silkless1 mutant did not prevent the formation of pistils in the tassel by nana plant2 in double mutants. In addition, we demonstrate that there is more to the silkless1 mutant than just a suppression of pistil growth. We document novel phenotypes of silkless1 mutants including weakly penetrant ear fasciation and anther persistence in the ear florets. Thus, the JA/AP2 mechanism of pistil retention in the tassel and silk growth in the ear are similarly sensitive to loss of the SILKLESS1 protein, while the BR/GA mechanism is not."
37441182,response to Fusarium seedling rot,Cell wall-related genes and lignin accumulation contribute to the root resistance in different maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes to Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg infection.,"Introduction: The fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg (Fv) causes considerable agricultural and economic losses and is harmful to animal and human health. Fv can infect maize throughout its long agricultural cycle, and root infection drastically affects maize growth and yield. Methods: The root cell wall is the first physical and defensive barrier against soilborne pathogens such as Fv. This study compares two contrasting genotypes of maize (Zea mays L.) roots that are resistant (RES) or susceptible (SUS) to Fv infection by using transcriptomics, fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy analyses, and ddPCR. Results: Seeds were infected with a highly virulent local Fv isolate. Although Fv infected both the RES and SUS genotypes, infection occurred faster in SUS, notably showing a difference of three to four days. In addition, root infections in RES were less severe in comparison to SUS infections. Comparative transcriptomics (rate +Fv/control) were performed seven days after inoculation (DAI). The analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each rate revealed 733 and 559 unique transcripts that were significantly (P ≤0.05) up and downregulated in RES (+Fv/C) and SUS (+Fv/C), respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified coumarin and furanocoumarin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction pathways as being highly enriched with specific genes involved in cell wall modifications in the RES genotype, whereas the SUS genotype mainly displayed a repressed plant-pathogen interaction pathway and did not show any enriched cell wall genes. In particular, cell wall-related gene expression showed a higher level in RES than in SUS under Fv infection. Analysis of DEG abundance made it possible to identify transcripts involved in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, biosynthetic and catabolic processes, pectin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis and organization. Root histological analysis in RES showed an increase in lignified cells in the sclerenchymatous hypodermis zone during Fv infection. Discussion: These differences in the cell wall and lignification could be related to an enhanced degradation of the root hairs and the epidermis cell wall in SUS, as was visualized by SEM. These findings reveal that components of the root cell wall are important against Fv infection and possibly other soilborne phytopathogens."
37443398,response to Gibberella stalk rot,Evaluation of Resistance Resources and Analysis of Resistance Mechanism of Maize to Stalk Rot Caused by Fusarium graminearum.,"Maize stalk rot is one of the most destructive and widely distributed diseases in maize plants worldwide. Research on the performance and resistance mechanism of maize against stem rot is constantly improving. Here, among 120 inbred maize lines infected by Fusarium graminearum using the injection method, 4 lines (3.33%) of them were highly resistant to maize stalk rot, 28 lines (23.33%) were resistant, 57 lines (47.50%) were susceptible, and 31 lines (25.84%) were highly susceptible. The inbred lines 18N10118 and 18N10370 were the most resistant and susceptible with disease indices of 7.5 and 75.6, respectively. Treatment of resistant and susceptible maize inbred seedlings with F. graminearum showed that root hair growth of the susceptible inbred lines was significantly inhibited, and a large number of hyphae attached and adsorbed multiple conidia near the root system. However, the resistant inbred lines were delayed and inconspicuous, with only a few hyphae and spores appearing near the root system. Compared with susceptible inbred lines, resistant maize inbred line seedlings treated with F. graminearum exhibited elevated activities of catalase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenoloxidase, and superoxide dismutase. The authors identified 153 genes related to disease resistance by transcriptome analysis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and peroxisome pathway mainly regulated the resistance mechanism of maize inbred lines to F. graminearum infection. These two pathways might play an important role in the disease resistance mechanism, and the function of genes in the two pathways must be further studied, which might provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the molecular resistance mechanism of stalk rot and resistance gene mining."
37447017,drought response,Exogenous Sorbitol Application Confers Drought Tolerance to Maize Seedlings through Up-Regulating Antioxidant System and Endogenous Sorbitol Biosynthesis.,"This study aims to explore the impacts of exogenous sorbitol on maize seedlings under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-simulated drought stress. Six treatments were set: normal condition (CK), PEG (P), 10 mM sorbitol (10S), PEG plus 10 mM sorbitol (10SP), 100 mM sorbitol (100S) and PEG plus 100 mM sorbitol (100SP). Maize seedlings' growth under PEG-simulated drought stress was significantly inhibited and exogenous sorbitol largely alleviated this growth inhibition. The seedlings under 10SP treatment grew much better than those under P, 100S and 100SP treatments and no significant difference in growth parameters was observed between the control and 10S treatment. The seedlings treated with 10SP had higher contents of soluble sugar, soluble protein, proline, ascorbic acid (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH), sorbitol and relative water content, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and aldose reductase, but lower contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2 and relative electrical conductivity than those treated with P, 100S and 100SP. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript levels of genes encoding putative aldose reductase (AR) under P treatment were significantly up-regulated in sorbitol-applied treatments. Taken together, the results demonstrated that exogenous sorbitol application conferred drought tolerance to maize seedlings by up-regulating the expression levels of AR-related genes to enhance the accumulation of intracellular osmotic substances such as sorbitol and improve antioxidant systems to tone down the damage caused by drought stress."
37450243,lysine content; tryptophan content,"Enhancement of nutritional quality in maize kernel through marker-assisted breeding for vte4, crtRB1, and opaque2 genes.","Traditional maize is poor in vitamin-E [α-tocopherol (α-T): 6-8 ppm], vitamin-A [provitamin-A (proA): 1-2ppm], lysine (0.150-0.2-50%), and tryptophan (0.030-0.040%). Here, we combined favourable alleles of vte4, crtRB1, and opaque2 (o2) genes in the parents of maize hybrids, viz., APQH-10 (PMI-PV-9 × PMI-PV-14) and APQH-11 (PMI-PV-9 × PMI-PV-15) using molecular breeding. Gene-specific markers were successfully used to select vte4, crtRB1, and o2 in BC1F1, BC2F1, and BC2F2 generations. Simple sequence repeats (104-109) were used for background selection, leading to an average recovery of 94% recurrent parent genome. The introgressed inbreds possessed significantly higher α-T: 18.38 ppm, α-/γ-tocopherol (α-/γ-T: 52%), and α-/total tocopherol (α-/TT: 32%) compared to original inbreds (α-T: 8.17 ppm, α-/γ-T: 25%, α-/TT: 18%). These newly derived inbreds also possessed higher β-carotene (BC: 8.91 ppm), β-cryptoxanthin (BCX: 1.27 ppm), proA (9.54 ppm), lysine (0.348%), and tryptophan (0.082%) compared to traditional maize inbreds. The reconstituted hybrids recorded higher α-T (2.1-fold), α-/γ-T (1.9-fold), and α-/TT (1.6-fold) over the original hybrids. These reconstituted hybrids were also rich in BC (5.7-fold), BCX (3.3-fold), proA (5.3-fold), lysine (1.9-fold), and tryptophan (2.0-fold) over the traditional hybrids. The reconstituted hybrids had similar grain yield and phenotypic characteristics to original versions. These multinutrient-rich maize hybrids hold great potential to alleviate malnutrition in sustainable and cost-effective manner."
37457348,response to salt,ZmmiR169q/ZmNF-YA8 is a module that homeostatically regulates primary root growth and salt tolerance in maize,"In response to salt stress, plants alter the expression of manifold gene networks, enabling them to survive and thrive in the face of adversity. As a result, the growth and development of plant roots could be drastically altered, with significant inhibition of the growth of root meristematic zones. Although it is known that root growth is primarily regulated by auxins and cytokinins, the molecular regulatory mechanism by which salt stress stunts root meristems remains obscure. In this study, we found that the ZmmiR169q/ZmNF-YA8 module regulates the growth of maize taproots in response to salt stress. Salt stress downregulates ZmmiR169q expression, allowing for significant upregulation of ZmNF-YA8, which, in turn, activates ZmERF1B, triggering the upregulation of ASA1 and ASA2, two rate-limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of tryptophan (Trp), leading to the accumulation of auxin in the root tip, thereby inhibiting root growth. The development of the maize root is stymied as meristem cell division and meristematic zone expansion are both stifled. This study reveals the ZmmiR169q/ZmNF-YA8 module's involvement in maintaining an equilibrium in bestowing plant salt tolerance and root growth and development under salt stress, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the homeostatic regulation of plant development in response to salt stress."
37464740,environmental stress response,Genetic and Molecular Exploration of Maize Environmental Stress Resilience: Towards Sustainable Agriculture,"Global climate change exacerbates the effects of environmental stressors, such as drought, flooding, extreme temperatures, salinity and alkalinity, on crop growth and grain yield, threatening the sustainability of the food supply. Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most widely cultivated crops and the most abundant grain crop in production worldwide. However, maize yield stability is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Recently, great progress has been achieved in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying maize responses to environmental stresses and developing stress-resilient varieties through the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multi-omics analytic platforms and automated phenotyping facilities. In this review, we summarize recent advances in dissecting the genetic components contributing to maize abiotic stress tolerance through diverse genetic strategies. In addition, we discuss the future challenges and opportunities for developing climate-resilient maize varieties. 
Short Summary: Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most widely cultivated crops and the most abundant grain crop in production worldwide. Its yield is highly affected by abiotic stresses. This review summarizes recent advances in dissecting the genetic components contributing to maize abiotic stress tolerance through diverse genetic strategies. Furthermore, the future challenges and opportunities for developing climate-resilient maize varieties is discussed."
37469778,phosphorus use efficiency,Phosphorus partitioning contribute to phosphorus use efficiency during grain filling in Zea mays.,"Introduction: Lower phosphorus (P) availability limits crop productivity in agroecosystems. The remobilization of P from the source to the sink organs plays an important role in enhancing the P-utilization efficiency of crops. During the grain filling stage, phosphorus flow to the developing grains, the primary sink, determines crop yield. However, the specific contributions of different organs to grain P throughout the post-silking period in maize remain unclear. 

Methods: In our study, three maize inbred lines (CIMBL89, Ji846, and CML118) with contrasting P statuses were selected and grown in a field with high P (HP, 150 kg ha-1 P2O5) and low P (LP, 0 kg ha-1 P2O5) conditions. 

Results: The grain yield of CIMBL89 was 69% and 169% greater under HP supply, and 83% and 309% greater than those of Ji846 and CML118 under LP supply, respectively. The ear length, ear diameter, and kernel row number of CML118 were lower than those of CIMBL89 and Ji846 under HP conditions. Most of the P (87%) in the grains of CIMBL89 came from P uptake at the LP supply, while almost all P (95%) came from P remobilization in various organs at the HP supply after silking. In contrast, 91% of the P found in the grain of CML118 came from P remobilization under LP supply, while 76% came from P uptake under HP supply after silking. 

Discussion: In conclusion, our findings suggest that CIMBL89, with greater P acquisition efficiency, contributes to grain formation and production during the post-silking period under LP conditions. Additionally, CIMBL89 can fully remobilize P and avoid the extravagant absorption of P in P-sufficient soil, which sets it apart from Ji846 and CML118."
37479884,stalk quality; drought response,"A gibberellin-deficient maize mutant exhibits altered plant height, stem strength and drought tolerance.","The reduction in endogenous gibberellin improved drought resistance, but decreased cellulose and lignin contents, which made the mutant prone to lodging. It is well known that gibberellin (GA) is a hormone that plays a vital role in plant growth and development. In recent years, a growing number of studies have found that gibberellin plays an important role in regulating the plant height, stem length, and stressed growth surfaces. In this study, a dwarf maize mutant was screened from an EMS-induced mutant library of maize B73. The mutated gene was identified as KS, which encodes an ent-kaurene synthase (KS) enzyme functioning in the early biosynthesis of GA. The mutant was named as ks3-1. A significant decrease in endogenous GA levels was verified in ks3-1. A significantly decreased stem strength of ks3-1, compared with that of wild-type B73, was found. Significant decreases in the cellulose and lignin contents, as well as the number of epidermal cell layers, were further characterized in ks3-1. The expression levels of genes responsible for cellulose and lignin biosynthesis were induced by exogenous GA treatment. Under drought stress conditions, the survival rate of ks3-1 was significantly higher than that of the wild-type B73. The survival rates of both wild-type B73 and ks3-1 decreased significantly after exogenous GA treatment. In conclusion, we summarized that a decreased level of GA in ks3-1 caused a decreased plant height, a decreased stem strength as a result of cell wall defects, and an increased drought tolerance. Our results shed light on the importance of GA and GA-defective mutants in the genetic improvement of maize and breeding maize varieties. 
Key message: The reduction in endogenous gibberellin improved drought resistance, but decreased cellulose and lignin contents, which made the mutant prone to lodging."
37481121,response to cold stress,Genetic and lipidomic analyses reveal the key role of lipid metabolism for cold tolerance in maize,"Lipid remodeling is crucial for cold tolerance in plants. However, the precise alternations of lipidomics during cold responses remains elusive, especially in maize (Zea mays L.). In addition, the key genes responsible for cold tolerance in maize lipid metabolism have not been identified. Here, we integrate lipidomic, transcriptomic, and genetic analysis to determine the profile of lipid remodeling caused by cold stress. We find that the homeostasis of cellular lipid metabolism is essential for maintaining cold tolerance of maize. Also, we detect 213 lipid species belonging to 14 major classes, covering phospholipids, glycerides, glycolipids, and free fatty acids. Various lipid metabolites undergo specific and selective alterations in response to cold stress, especially mono/di-unsaturated lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol, as well as polyunsaturated phosphatidic acid, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol. In addition, we identify a subset of key enzymes, including ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, acyl-carrier protein 2, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and stearoyl-ACP desaturase 2 involved in glycerolipid biosynthetic pathways are positive regulators of maize cold tolerance. These results reveal a comprehensive lipidomic profile during the cold response of maize and provide genetic resources for enhancing cold tolerance in crops."
37490479,kernel development,Defective kernel 66 encodes a GTPase essential for kernel development in maize,"Mitochondria is a semi-autonomous organelle that provides energy for cell activities through oxidative phosphorylation. In this study, we identified a defective kernel 66 (dek66)-mutant maize with defective kernels. We characterized the candidate gene DEK66, encoding a ribosomal assembly factor, locating in mitochondria, and possessing GTPase activity (the GTPase belonged to ribosome biogenesis GTPase A family). In the dek66 mutant, abolishment of mitochondrial structure and function led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and promoted programmed cell death in endosperm cells. Furthermore, transcript level of most of the key genes associated with nutrient storage, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, and mitochondrial ribosomes in the dek66 mutant were significantly altered. Collectively, the results suggested that DEK66 is essential for the development of maize kernels via affecting the mitochondrial function. This study provided a reference to understand the impact of mitochondrial ribosomal assembly factor in maize kernel development. 
Highlight: DEK66 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal assembly factor and is involved in the regulation of maize kernel development by affecting the morphology and function of mitochondria."
37498331,foliar senescence,Mapping the gene of a maize leaf senescence mutant and understanding the senescence pathways by expression analysis,"Narrowing down to a single putative target gene behind a leaf senescence mutant and constructing the regulation network by proteomic method. Leaf senescence mutant is an important resource for exploring molecular mechanism of aging. To dig for potential modulation networks during maize leaf aging process, we delimited the gene responsible for a premature leaf senescence mutant els5 to a 1.1 Mb interval in the B73 reference genome using a BC1F1 population with 40,000 plants, and analyzed the leaf proteomics of the mutant and its near-isogenic wild type line. A total of 1355 differentially accumulated proteins (DAP) were mainly enriched in regulation pathways such as ""photosynthesis"", ""ribosome"", and ""porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism"" by the KEGG pathway analysis. The interaction networks constructed by incorporation of transcriptome data showed that ZmELS5 likely repaired several key factors in the photosynthesis system. The putative candidate proteins for els5 were proposed based on DAPs in the fined QTL mapping interval. These results provide fundamental basis for cloning and functional research of the els5 gene, and new insights into the molecular mechanism of leaf senescence in maize. 
Key messages: Narrowing down to a single putative target gene behind a leaf senescence mutant and constructing the regulation network by proteomic method."
37501369,nuclear male sterility,ZmMS1/ZmLBD30-orchestrated transcriptional regulatory networks precisely control pollen exine development.,"Owing to its significance to plant male fertility and hence direct impact on crop yield, pollen exine development has inspired decades of scientific inquiry. However, molecular mechanism underlying exine formation and thickness remains elusive. Here, we found that a previously unrecognized repressor ZmMS1/ZmLBD30 controls proper pollen exine development in maize. Using an ms1 mutant with aberrantly thickened exine, we identified a male-sterility gene, ZmMs1, encoding a tapetum-specific lateral organ boundaries domain transcription factor ZmLBD30. ZmMs1/ZmLBD30 is initially turned on by a transcriptional activation cascade of ZmbHLH51-ZmMYB84-ZmMS7, and ZmMS1/ZmLBD30 then serves as a repressor to shut down this cascade via feedback repression to ensure timely tapetal degeneration and the proper level of exine. This feedback repression loop towards male fertility is conserved in maize and sorghum, and sheds light on other flowering plants such as rice and Arabidopsis. Our findings reveal a long-sought master repressor of upstream activators to prevent excessive exine formation. 
Summary：The causal gene of the first discovered maize male sterility mutant ms1 was identified as ZmMs1, encoding ZmLBD30. A transcriptional activation cascade ZmbHLH51-mMYB84-ZmMS7 initially turns on ZmMs1/ZmLBD30, and ZmMS1/ZmLBD30 then serves as a repressor to shut down the cascade via feedback repression to ensure timely tapetal degeneration and the proper level of exine, revealing a novel mechanism of pollen development."
37514211,drought response,"Co-Inoculation with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Dark Septate Endophytes under Drought Stress: Synergistic or Competitive Effects on Maize Growth, Photosynthesis, Root Hydraulic Properties and Aquaporins?","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate fungi (DSE) were simultaneously colonized in the root cells of maize. Single AMF and DSE symbiosis have been proven to improve the drought tolerance of maize. However, the effects of both fungi coexisting in maize roots under drought stress are not yet known. In this study, pot experiments of maize seedlings were conducted through four inoculation treatments (single AMF inoculation of Rhizophagus irregularis, single DSE inoculation of Exophiala pisciphila, co-inoculation of AMF + DSE and non-mycorrhizal inoculation) under well-watered (WW) and drought-stressed (DS) conditions. AMF and DSE colonization status, maize physiology and aquaporin gene expression in maize roots were investigated. The objective of this paper was to evaluate whether AMF and DSE had competitive, independent or synergistic effects on regulating the drought tolerance of maize. When maize seedlings of three inoculation treatments were subjected to drought stress, single AMF inoculation had the highest shoot and root dry weight, plant height, root length, osmotic root hydraulic conductivity and hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivity in maize seedlings. However, co-inoculation of AMF + DSE induced the highest stomatal conductance in maize leaves and the lowest H2O2 and O2•- concentration, membrane electrolyte leakage, intercellular CO2 concentration and gene expression level of ZmPIP1;1, ZmPIP1;2, ZmPIP2;1, ZmPIP2;5 and ZmPIP2;6. In addition, co-inoculation of AMF + DSE also obviously down-regulated the GintAQPF1 and GintAQPF2 expression in R. irregularis compared with single AMF inoculation treatment. Under DS stress, there were competitive relationships between AMF and DSE with regard to regulating mycorrhizal colonization, maize growth, root hydraulic conductivity and the gene expression of aquaporins in R. irregularis, but there were synergistic relationships with regard to regulating membrane electrolyte leakage, oxidative damage, photosynthesis and the aquaporin gene expression of maize seedlings. The obtained results improve our knowledge about how the mechanisms of AMF and DSE coexist, promoting the drought tolerance of host plants."
37538055,response to Fusarium ear rot,Maize kernel metabolome involved in resistance to fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination.,"Fusarium verticillioides poses a threat to worldwide maize production due to its ability to infect maize kernel and synthesize fumonisins that can be accumulated above safety levels for humans and animals. Maize breeding has been proposed as key tool to decrease kernel contamination with fumonisins, but metabolic studies complementary to genomic approaches are necessary to disclose the complexity of maize resistance. An untargeted metabolomic study was proposed using inbreds genetically related but with contrasting levels of resistance in order to uncover pathways implicated in resistance to Fusarium ear rot (FER) and fumonisin contamination in the maize kernel and to look for possible biomarkers. Metabolite determinations were performed in kernels collected at 3 and 10 days after inoculation with F. verticillioides (dat). Discriminant metabolites between resistant and susceptible RILs were rather found at 10 than 3 dat, although metabolite differences at later stages of colonization could be driven by subtle variations at earlier stages of infection. Within this context, differences for membrane lipid homeostasis, methionine metabolism, and indolacetic acid conjugation seemed highly relevant to distinguish between resistant and susceptible inbreds, confirming the polygenic nature of resistance to FER and fumonisin contamination in the maize kernels. Nevertheless, some specific metabolites such as the polyamine spermidine and/or the alkaloid isoquinoline seemed to be promising indirect selection traits to improve resistance to FER and reduce fumonisin accumulation. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be necessary to validate the inhibitory effects of these compounds on fumonisins biosynthesis."
37546274,response to Fusarium seedling rot,Roles of the MYB94/FUSED LEAVES1 (ZmFDL1) and GLOSSY2 (ZmGL2) genes in cuticle biosynthesis and potential impacts on Fusarium verticillioides growth on maize silks,"Maize silks, the stigmatic portions of the female flowers, have an important role in reproductive development. Silks also provide entry points for pathogens into host tissues since fungal hyphae move along the surface of the silks to reach the site of infection, i.e., the developing kernel. The outer extracellular surface of the silk is covered by a protective hydrophobic cuticle, comprised of a complex array of long-chain hydrocarbons and small amounts of very long chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols. This work illustrates that two previously characterized cuticle-related genes separately exert roles on maize silk cuticle deposition and function. ZmMYB94/FUSED LEAVES 1 (ZmFDL1) MYB transcription factor is a key regulator of cuticle deposition in maize seedlings. The ZmGLOSSY2 (ZmGL2) gene, a putative member of the BAHD superfamily of acyltransferases with close sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis AtCER2 gene, is involved in the elongation of the fatty acid chains that serve as precursors of the waxes on young leaves. In silks, lack of ZmFDL1 action generates a decrease in the accumulation of a wide number of compounds, including alkanes and alkenes of 20 carbons or greater and affects the expression of cuticle-related genes. These results suggest that ZmFDL1 retains a regulatory role in silks, which might be exerted across the entire wax biosynthesis pathway. Separately, a comparison between gl2-ref and wild-type silks reveals differences in the abundance of specific cuticular wax constituents, particularly those of longer unsaturated carbon chain lengths. The inferred role of ZmGL2 is to control the chain lengths of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The treatment of maize silks with Fusarium verticillioides conidia suspension results in altered transcript levels of ZmFDL1 and ZmGL2 genes. In addition, an increase in fungal growth was observed on gl2-ref mutant silks 72 hours after Fusarium infection. These findings suggest that the silk cuticle plays an active role in the response to F. verticillioides infection."
37555969,ears per plant,The genetic architecture of prolificacy in maize revealed by association mapping and bulk segregant analysis.,"Here, we revealed maize prolificacy highly correlated with domestication and identified a causal gene ZmEN1 located in one novel QTL qGEN261 that regulating maize prolificacy by using multiple-mapping methods. The development of maize prolificacy (EN) is crucial for enhancing yield and breeding specialty varieties. To achieve this goal, we employed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to analyze the genetic architecture of EN in maize. Using 492 inbred lines with a wide range of EN variability, our results demonstrated significant differences in genetic, environmental, and interaction effects. The broad-sense heritability (H2) of EN was 0.60. Through GWAS, we identified 527 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), involved 290 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and 806 genes. Of these SNPs, 18 and 509 were classified as major effect loci and minor loci, respectively. In addition, we performed a bulk segregant analysis (BSA) in an F2 population constructed by a few-ears line Zheng58 and a multi-ears line 647. Our BSA results identified one significant QTL, qBEN1. Importantly, combining the GWAS and BSA, four co-located QTL, involving six genes, were identified. Three of them were expressed in vegetative meristem, shoot tip, internode and tip of ear primordium, with ZmEN1, encodes an unknown auxin-like protein, having the highest expression level in these tissues. It suggested that ZmEN1 plays a crucial role in promoting axillary bud and tillering to encourage the formation of prolificacy. Haplotype analysis of ZmEN1 revealed significant differences between different haplotypes, with inbred lines carrying hap6 having more EN. Overall, this is the first report about using GWAS and BSA to dissect the genetic architecture of EN in maize, which can be valuable for breeding specialty maize varieties and improving maize yield. 
Key message: Here, we revealed maize prolificacy highly correlated with domestication and identified a causal gene ZmEN1 located in one novel QTL qGEN261 that regulating maize prolificacy by using multiple-mapping methods."
37558498,days to flowering,A single nucleotide polymorphism in conz1 enhances maize adaptation to higher latitudes.,"We demonstrated that SNP166, a nonsynonymous mutation in the conserved B-box domain of CONZ1 conferred the photoperiod flowering QTL qPR9. The SNP166A allele that reduces photoperiod sensitivity occurred after initial maize domestication, and its selection enhanced maize adaptation to higher latitudes of temperate regions."
37561272,response to salt,Overexpression of chloroplastic Zea mays NADP-malic enzyme (ZmNADP-ME) confers tolerance to salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The C4 plants photosynthesize better than C3 plants especially in arid environment. As an attempt to genetically convert C3 plant to C4, the cDNA of decarboxylating C4 type NADP-malic enzyme from Zea mays (ZmNADP-ME) that has lower Km for malate and NADP than its C3 isoforms, was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana under the control of 35S promoter. Due to increased activity of NADP-ME in the transgenics the malate decarboxylation increased that resulted in loss of carbon skeletons needed for amino acid and protein synthesis. Consequently, amino acid and protein content of the transgenics declined. Therefore, the Chl content, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), electron transport rate (ETR), the quantum yield of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, rosette diameter, and biomass were lower in the transgenics. However, in salt stress (150 mM NaCl), the overexpressers had higher Chl, protein content, Fv/Fm, ETR, and biomass than the vector control. NADPH generated in the transgenics due to increased malate decarboxylation, contributed to augmented synthesis of proline, the osmoprotectant required to alleviate the reactive oxygen species-mediated membrane damage and oxidative stress. Consequently, the glutathione peroxidase activity increased and H2O2 content decreased in the salt-stressed transgenics. The reduced membrane lipid peroxidation and lower malondialdehyde production resulted in better preservation, of thylakoid integrity and membrane architecture in the transgenics under saline environment. Our results clearly demonstrate that overexpression of C4 chloroplastic ZmNADP-ME in the C3 Arabidopsis thaliana, although decrease their photosynthetic efficiency, protects the transgenics from salinity stress."
37565685,chlorophyll fluorescence: leaf; light reflectance,Leaf excision introduces limited and species-specific effects on photosynthetic parameters across crop functional types.,"Photosynthesis is increasingly becoming a recognised target for crop improvement. Phenotyping photosynthesis-related traits on field-grown material is a key bottleneck to progress here due to logistical barriers and short measurement days. Many studies attempt to overcome these challenges by phenotyping excised leaf material in the laboratory. To date there are no demonstrated examples of the representative nature of photosynthesis measurements performed on excised leaves relative to intact leaves in crops. Here, we tested whether standardised leaf excision on the day prior to phenotyping impacted a range of common photosynthesis-related traits across crop functional types using tomato (C3-dicot), barley (C3-monocot), and maize (C4-monocot). Potentially constraining aspects of leaf physiology that could be forecasted to impair photosynthesis in excised leaves, namely leaf water potential and abscisic acid accumulation, were not different between intact and excised leaves. We also observed non-significant differences in spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence traits between the treatments across the three species. However, we did observe some significant differences between gas exchange and photosynthetic capacity associated traits across all three species. This study represents a useful reference for those who perform measurements of this nature and the differences reported should be considered in associated experimental design and statistical analyses."
37569644,response to heat stress,The Essential Role of H2S-ABA Crosstalk in Maize Thermotolerance through the ROS-Scavenging System.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and abscisic acid (ABA), as a signaling molecule and stress hormone, their crosstalk-induced thermotolerance in maize seedlings and its underlying mechanism were elusive. In this paper, H2S and ABA crosstalk as well as the underlying mechanism of crosstalk-induced thermotolerance in maize seedlings were investigated. The data show that endogenous levels of H2S and ABA in maize seedlings could be mutually induced by regulating their metabolic enzyme activity and gene expression under non-heat stress (non-HS) and HS conditions. Furthermore, H2S and ABA alone or in combination significantly increase thermotolerance in maize seedlings by improving the survival rate (SR) and mitigating biomembrane damage. Similarly, the activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system, including enzymatic antioxidants catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the non-enzymatic antioxidants reduced ascorbic acid (AsA), carotenoids (CAR), flavone (FLA), and total phenols (TP), was enhanced by H2S and ABA alone or in combination in maize seedlings. Conversely, the ROS level (mainly hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical) was weakened by H2S and ABA alone or in combination in maize seedlings under non-HS and HS conditions. These data imply that the ROS-scavenging system played an essential role in H2S-ABA crosstalk-induced thermotolerance in maize seedlings."
37572352,water use efficiency; stomata number,Natural polymorphisms in ZmIRX15A affect water-use efficiency by modulating stomatal density in maize.,"Stomatal density (SD) is closely related to crop drought resistance. Understanding the genetic basis for natural variation in SD may facilitate efforts to improve water-use efficiency. Here, we report a genome-wide association study for SD in maize seedlings, which identified 18 genetic variants that could be resolved to seven candidate genes. A 3-bp insertion variant (InDel1089) in the last exon of Zea mays (Zm) IRX15A (Irregular xylem 15A) had the most significant association with SD and modulated the translation of ZmIRX15A mRNA by affecting its secondary structure. Dysfunction of ZmIRX15A increased SD, leading to an increase in the transpiration rate and CO2 assimilation efficiency. ZmIRX15A encodes a xylan deposition enzyme and its disruption significantly decreased xylan abundance in secondary cell wall composition. Transcriptome analysis revealed a substantial alteration of the expression of genes involved in stomatal complex morphogenesis and drought response in the loss-of-function of ZmIRX15A mutant. Overall, our study provides important genetic insights into the natural variation of leaf SD in maize, and the identified loci or genes can serve as direct targets for enhancing drought resistance in molecular-assisted maize breeding."
37580686,response to salt; root length,Natural variation in ZmNAC087 contributes to total root length regulation in maize seedlings under salt stress,"Soil salinity poses a significant challenge to crop growth and productivity, particularly affecting the root system, which is vital for water and nutrient uptake. To identify genetic factors that influence root elongation in stressful environments, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the natural variation associated with total root length (TRL) under salt stress and normal conditions in maize seedlings. Our study identified 69 genetic variants associated with 38 candidate genes, among which a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZmNAC087 was significantly associated with TRL under salt stress. Transient expression and transactivation assays revealed that ZmNAC087 encodes a nuclear-localized protein with transactivation activity. Further candidate gene association analysis showed that non-coding variations in ZmNAC087 promoter contribute to differential ZmNAC087 expression among maize inbred lines, potentially influencing the variation in salt-regulated TRL. In addition, through nucleotide diversity analysis, neutrality tests, and coalescent simulation, we demonstrated that ZmNAC087 underwent selection during maize domestication and improvement. These findings highlight the significance of natural variation in ZmNAC087, particularly the favorable allele, in maize salt tolerance, providing theoretical basis and valuable genetic resources for the development of salt-tolerant maize germplasm."
37583092,plant height,ZmBELL10 interacts with other ZmBELLs and recognizes specific motifs for transcriptional activation to modulate internode patterning in maize.,"Plant height is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yield. Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying plant height regulation is also an important question in developmental biology. Here, we report that a BELL transcription factor, ZmBELL10, positively regulates plant height in maize (Zea mays). Loss of ZmBELL10 function resulted in shorter internodes, fewer nodes, and smaller kernels, while ZmBELL10 overexpression increased plant height and hundred-kernel weight. Transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing showed that ZmBELL10 recognizes specific sequences in the promoter of its target genes and activates cell division- and cell elongation-related gene expression, thereby influencing node number and internode length in maize. ZmBELL10 interacted with several other ZmBELL proteins via a spatial structure in its POX domain to form protein complexes involving ZmBELL10. All interacting proteins recognized the same DNA sequences, and their interaction with ZmBELL10 increased target gene expression. We identified the key residues in the POX domain of ZmBELL10 responsible for its protein-protein interactions, but these residues did not affect its transactivation activity. Collectively, our findings shed light on the functions of ZmBELL10 protein complexes and provide potential targets for improving plant architecture and yield in maize."
37584802,response to heavy metals,Differences of cadmium uptake and accumulation in roots of two maize varieties (Zea mays L.),"Different maize varieties respond differentially to cadmium (Cd) stress. As the first organ in contact with the soil, the response of the root is particularly important. However, the physiological mechanisms that determine the response are not well defined. Here, we compared the differences in Cd-induced related gene expression, ionic homeostasis, and ultrastructural changes in roots of Cd-tolerant maize variety (XR57) and Cd-sensitive maize variety (LY296), and assessed their effects on Cd uptake and accumulation. Our findings indicate that XR57 absorbed a significantly lower Cd than LY296 did, and that the expression levels of genes related to Cd uptake (ZmNRAMP5 and ZmZIP4) and efflux (ZmABCG4) in the root were consistent with the Cd absorption at the physiological levels. Compared with LY296, the lower Cd concentration in the roots of XR57 caused less interference with the ion balance. Transmission electron microscope images revealed that the roots from XR57 exposed to Cd had developed thicker cell walls than LY296. In addition, the large increase ZmABCC1 and ZmABCC2 expression levels in XR57 mediated the appearance of numerous electron-dense granules in the vacuoles present in the roots. As a result, the high Cd tolerance of XR57 is the result of a multi-level response that involves increased resistance to Cd uptake, a stronger capacity for vacuolar regionalization, and the formation of thicker cell walls. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for maize cultivation in Cd-contaminated areas."
37587553,response to heat stress,"Maize and heat stress: Physiological, genetic, and molecular insights.","Global mean temperature is increasing at a rapid pace due to the rapid emission of greenhouse gases majorly from anthropogenic practices and predicted to rise up to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level by the year 2050. The warming climate is affecting global crop production by altering biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes resulting in poor growth, development, and reduced yield. Maize is susceptible to heat stress, particularly at the reproductive and early grain filling stages. Interestingly, heat stress impact on crops is closely regulated by associated environmental covariables such as humidity, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture content, and solar radiation. Therefore, heat stress tolerance is considered as a complex trait, which requires multiple levels of regulations in plants. Exploring genetic diversity from landraces and wild accessions of maize is a promising approach to identify novel donors, traits, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and genes, which can be introgressed into the elite cultivars. Indeed, genome wide association studies (GWAS) for mining of potential QTL(s) and dominant gene(s) is a major route of crop improvement. Conversely, mutation breeding is being utilized for generating variation in existing populations with narrow genetic background. Besides breeding approaches, augmented production of heat shock factors (HSFs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been reported in transgenic maize to provide heat stress tolerance. Recent advancements in molecular techniques including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) would expedite the process for developing thermotolerant maize genotypes."
37590954,kernel size,zma-miR159 targets ZmMYB74 and ZmMYB138 transcription factors to regulate grain size and weight in maize,"Endosperm cell number is critical in determining grain size in maize (Zea mays). Here, zma-miR159 overexpression led to enlarged grains in independent transgenic lines, suggesting that zma-miR159 positively to maize grain size. Targeting of ZmMYB74 and ZmMYB138 transcription factor genes by zma-miR159 was validated using 5'RACE and dual luciferase assay. Lines in which ZmMYB74 was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 presented a similar enlarged grain phenotype as those with zma-miR159 overexpression. Downstream genes regulating cell division were identified through DNA affinity purification sequencing using ZmMYB74 and ZmMYB138. Our results suggest that zma-miR159-ZmMYB modules act as an endosperm development hub, participating in the division and proliferation of endosperm cells. 
One-sentence summary: zma-miR159 promotes endosperm cell division and proliferation by suppressing ZmMYB74 and ZmMYB138 expression, reducing repression of cell cycle genes."
37593046,Flowering,Multi-trait and multi-environment genomic prediction for flowering traits in maize: a deep learning approach.,"Maize (Zea mays L.), the third most widely cultivated cereal crop in the world, plays a critical role in global food security. To improve the efficiency of selecting superior genotypes in breeding programs, researchers have aimed to identify key genomic regions that impact agronomic traits. In this study, the performance of multi-trait, multi-environment deep learning models was compared to that of Bayesian models (Markov Chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed models (MCMCglmm), Bayesian Genomic Genotype-Environment Interaction (BGGE), and Bayesian Multi-Trait and Multi-Environment (BMTME)) in terms of the prediction accuracy of flowering-related traits (Anthesis-Silking Interval: ASI, Female Flowering: FF, and Male Flowering: MF). A tropical maize panel of 258 inbred lines from Brazil was evaluated in three sites (Cambira-2018, Sabaudia-2018, and Iguatemi-2020 and 2021) using approximately 290,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The results demonstrated a 14.4% increase in prediction accuracy when employing multi-trait models compared to the use of a single trait in a single environment approach. The accuracy of predictions also improved by 6.4% when using a single trait in a multi-environment scheme compared to using multi-trait analysis. Additionally, deep learning models consistently outperformed Bayesian models in both single and multiple trait and environment approaches. A complementary genome-wide association study identified associations with 26 candidate genes related to flowering time traits, and 31 marker-trait associations were identified, accounting for 37%, 37%, and 22% of the phenotypic variation of ASI, FF and MF, respectively. In conclusion, our findings suggest that deep learning models have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of predictions, regardless of the approach used and provide support for the efficacy of this method in genomic selection for flowering-related traits in tropical maize."
37595026,foliar senescence,Genetic architecture of source-sink-regulated senescence in maize.,"Source and sink interactions play a critical but mechanistically poorly understood role in the regulation of senescence. To disentangle the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying source-sink regulated senescence (SSRS), we performed a phenotypic, transcriptomic, and systems genetics analysis of senescence induced by the lack of a strong sink in maize (Zea mays). Comparative analysis of genotypes with contrasting SSRS phenotypes revealed that feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, a surge in reactive oxygen species, and the resulting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were the earliest outcomes of weakened sink demand. Multi-environmental evaluation of a biparental population and a diversity panel identified 12 quantitative trait loci and 24 candidate genes, respectively, underlying SSRS. Combining the natural diversity and coexpression networks analyses identified seven high-confidence candidate genes involved in proteolysis, photosynthesis, stress response, and protein folding. The role of a cathepsin B like protease 4 (ccp4), a candidate gene supported by systems genetic analysis, was validated by analysis of natural alleles in maize and heterologous analyses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Analysis of natural alleles suggested that a 700-bp polymorphic promoter region harboring multiple ABA-responsive elements is responsible for differential transcriptional regulation of ccp4 by ABA and the resulting variation in SSRS phenotype. We propose a model for SSRS wherein feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, ABA signaling, and oxidative stress converge to induce ER stress manifested as programmed cell death and senescence. These findings provide a deeper understanding of signals emerging from loss of sink strength and offer opportunities to modify these signals to alter senescence program and enhance crop productivity."
37601731,days to flowering; drought response,QTL mapping for flowering time in a maize-teosinte population under well-watered and water-stressed conditions.,"Maize grain yield can be greatly reduced when flowering time coincides with drought conditions, which delays silking and consequently increases the anthesis-silking interval. Although the genetic basis of delayed flowering time under water-stressed conditions has been elucidated in maize-maize populations, little is known in this regard about maize-teosinte populations. Here, 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for three flowering-time traits, namely days to anthesis, days to silk, and the anthesis-silking interval, were identified in a maize-teosinte introgression population under well-watered and water-stressed conditions; these QTL explained 3.98-32.61% of phenotypic variations. Six of these QTL were considered to be sensitive to drought stress, and the effect of any individual QTL was small, indicating the complex genetic nature of drought resistance in maize. To resolve which genes underlie the six QTL, 11 candidate genes were identified via colocalization analysis of known associations with flowering-time-related drought traits. Among the 11 candidate genes, five were found to be differentially expressed in response to drought stress or under selection during maize domestication, and thus represented the most likely candidates underlying the drought-sensitive QTL. The results lay a foundation for further studies of the genetic mechanisms of drought resistance and provide valuable information for improving drought resistance during maize breeding.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11032-023-01413-0."
37606710,root morphology,Hybrid performance evaluation and genome-wide association analysis of root system architecture in a maize association population.,"The genetic architecture of RSA traits was dissected by GWAS and coexpression networks analysis in a maize association population. Root system architecture (RSA) is a crucial determinant of water and nutrient uptake efficiency in crops. However, the maize genetic architecture of RSA is still poorly understood due to the challenges in quantifying root traits and the lack of dense molecular markers. Here, an association mapping panel including 356 inbred lines were crossed with a common tester, Zheng58, and the test crosses were phenotyped for 12 RSA traits in three locations. We observed a 1.3 ~ sixfold phenotypic variation for measured RSA in the association panel. The association panel consisted of four subpopulations, non-stiff stalk (NSS) lines, stiff stalk (SS), tropical/subtropical (TST), and mixed. Zheng58 × TST has a 2.1% higher crown root number (CRN) and 8.6% less brace root number (BRN) than Zheng58 × NSS and Zheng58 × SS, respectively. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 1.25 million SNPs and correction for population structure, 191 significant SNPs were identified for root traits. Ninety (47%) of the significant SNPs showed positive allelic effects, and 101 (53%) showed negative effects. Each locus could explain 0.39% to 11.8% of phenotypic variation. By integrating GWAS results and comparing coexpression networks, 26 high-priority candidate genes were identified. Gene GRMZM2G377215, which belongs to the COBRA-like gene family, affected root growth and development. Gene GRMZM2G468657 encodes the aspartic proteinase nepenthesin-1, related to root development and N-deficient response. Collectively, our research provides progress in the genetic dissection of root system architecture. These findings present the further possibility for the genetic improvement of root traits in maize."
37609038,grain quality; grain yield,Unravelling the genetic framework associated with grain quality and yield-related traits in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Maize serves as a crucial nutrient reservoir for a significant portion of the global population. However, to effectively address the growing world population's hidden hunger, it is essential to focus on two key aspects: biofortification of maize and improving its yield potential through advanced breeding techniques. Moreover, the coordination of multiple targets within a single breeding program poses a complex challenge. This study compiled mapping studies conducted over the past decade, identifying quantitative trait loci associated with grain quality and yield related traits in maize. Meta-QTL analysis of 2,974 QTLs for 169 component traits (associated with quality and yield related traits) revealed 68 MQTLs across different genetic backgrounds and environments. Most of these MQTLs were further validated using the data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Further, ten MQTLs, referred to as breeding-friendly MQTLs (BF-MQTLs), with a significant phenotypic variation explained over 10% and confidence interval less than 2 Mb, were shortlisted. BF-MQTLs were further used to identify potential candidate genes, including 59 genes encoding important proteins/products involved in essential metabolic pathways. Five BF-MQTLs associated with both quality and yield traits were also recommended to be utilized in future breeding programs. Synteny analysis with wheat and rice genomes revealed conserved regions across the genomes, indicating these hotspot regions as validated targets for developing biofortified, high-yielding maize varieties in future breeding programs. After validation, the identified candidate genes can also be utilized to effectively model the plant architecture and enhance desirable quality traits through various approaches such as marker-assisted breeding, genetic engineering, and genome editing."

37616000,response to heavy metals,Exogenously applied sodium nitroprusside alleviates nickel toxicity in maize by regulating antioxidant activities and defense-related gene expression.,"Nickel (Ni) stress adversely affects plant growth and biomass accumulation, posturing severe menace to crop production and food security. The current study aimed to determine the putative role of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in mitigating Ni-induced phytotoxicity and identify the underlying defense mechanisms in maize, which are poorly understood. Our findings showed that SNP significantly augmented plant growth, biomass, and photosynthesis-related attributes (Fv/Fm, Fm, qP ETR, and ΦPSII) through diminishing Ni uptake and translocation in root and shoot tissues of maize under Ni stress conditions. In parallel, exogenous SNP substantially relieved maize seedlings from Ni-induced stress by enhancing enzymatic (SOD, CAT, and GPX) and non-enzymatic (phenol and flavonoids) antioxidant defenses and reducing oxidative stress indicators (MDA and H2 O2 ). The results revealed that SNP treatment increased the content of organic osmolyte glycine betaine and the activity of GST, concomitantly with ATP and ionic exchange capacity (including Ca2+ -ATPase and Mg2+ -ATPase), advocating its sufficiency to promote plant growth and avert Ni-induced stress in maize plants. The only exception was the production of organic acids (citric, oxalic, malic, and formic acids), which was reduced as SNP treatment relieved maize seedlings from Ni-induced oxidative damage. The application of SNP also displayed higher expression of defense- and detoxifying-related genes than in control treatments. Together, our data highlighted the mechanism involved in the amelioration of Ni toxicity by SNP; thus, suggesting a potential role of SNP in mitigating the adverse effects of Ni-contaminated soils to boost growth and yield of crop plants, that is, maize."
37622733,disease response; animal response,The impact of climate change on maize chemical defenses.,"Climate change is increasingly affecting agriculture, both at the levels of crops themselves, and by altering the distribution and damage caused by insect or microbial pests. As global food security depends on the reliable production of major crops such as maize (Zea mays), it is vital that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate these negative impacts. To do this a clear understanding of what the impacts are and how they occur is needed. This review focuses on the impact of climate change on the production and effectiveness of maize chemical defenses, including volatile organic compounds, terpenoid phytoalexins, benzoxazinoids, phenolics, and flavonoids. Drought, flooding, heat stress, and elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, all impact the production of maize chemical defenses, in a compound and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, changes in stomatal conductance and altered soil conditions caused by climate change can impact environmental dispersal and effectiveness certain chemicals. This can alter both defensive barrier formation and multitrophic interactions. The production of defense chemicals is controlled by stress signaling networks. The use of similar networks to co-ordinate the response to abiotic and biotic stress can lead to complex integration of these networks in response to the combinatorial stresses that are likely to occur in a changing climate. The impact of multiple stressors on maize chemical defenses can therefore be different from the sum of the responses to individual stressors and challenging to predict. Much work remains to effectively leverage these protective chemicals in climate-resilient maize."
37623372,pollen tube growth,Heat-dependent postpollination limitations on maize pollen tube growth and kernel sterility.,"Heat stress has a negative impact on pollen development in maize (Zea mays L.) but the postpollination events that determine kernel sterility are less well characterised. The impact of short-term (hours) heat exposure during postpollination was therefore assessed in silks and ovaries. The temperatures inside the kernels housed within the husks was significantly lower than the imposed heat stress. This protected the ovaries and possibly the later phase of pollen tube growth from the adverse effects of heat stress. Failure of maize kernel fertilization was observed within 6 h of heat stress exposure postpollination. This was accompanied by a significant restriction of early pollen tube growth rather than pollen germination. Limitations on early pollen tube growth were therefore a major factor contributing to heat stress-induced kernel sterility. Exposure to heat stress altered the sugar composition of silks, suggesting that hexose supply contributed to the limitations on pollen tube growth. Moreover, the activities of sucrose metabolising enzymes, the expression of sucrose degradation and trehalose biosynthesis genes were decreased following heat stress. Significant increases in reactive oxygen species, abscisic acid and auxin levels accompanied by altered expression of phytohormone-related genes may also be important in the heat-induced suppression of pollen tube growth."
37633966,tassel branch number,QTG-Miner aids rapid dissection of the genetic base of tassel branch number in maize,"Genetic dissection of agronomic traits is important for crop improvement and global food security. Phenotypic variation of tassel branch number (TBN), a major breeding target, is controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The lack of large-scale QTL cloning methodology constrains the systematic dissection of TBN, which hinders modern maize breeding. Here, we devise QTG-Miner, a multi-omics data-based technique for large-scale and rapid cloning of quantitative trait genes (QTGs) in maize. Using QTG-Miner, we clone and verify seven genes underlying seven TBN QTLs. Compared to conventional methods, QTG-Miner performs well for both major- and minor-effect TBN QTLs. Selection analysis indicates that a substantial number of genes and network modules have been subjected to selection during maize improvement. Selection signatures are significantly enriched in multiple biological pathways between female heterotic groups and male heterotic groups. In summary, QTG-Miner provides a large-scale approach for rapid cloning of QTGs in crops and dissects the genetic base of TBN for further maize breeding."
37641589,tassel branch number,Identification of QTLs and their candidate genes for the number of maize tassel branches in F2 from two higher generation sister lines using QTL mapping and RNA-seq analysis.,"Tassel branch number is an important agronomic trait that is closely associated with maize kernels and yield. The regulation of genes associated with tassel branch development can provide a theoretical basis for analyzing tassel branch growth and improving maize yield. In this study. we used two high-generation sister maize lines, PCU (unbranched) and PCM (multiple-branched), to construct an F2 population comprising 190 individuals, which were genotyped and mapped using the Maize6H-60K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. Candidate genes associated with tassel development were subsequently identified by analyzing samples collected at three stages of tassel growth via RNA-seq. A total of 13 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 22 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) associated with tassel branch number (TBN) were identified, among which, two major QTLs, qTBN6.06-1 and qTBN6.06-2, on chromosome 6 were identified in two progeny populations, accounting for 15.07% to 37.64% of the phenotypic variation. Moreover, we identified 613 genes that were differentially expressed between PCU and PCM, which, according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, were enriched in amino acid metabolism and plant signal transduction pathways. Additionally, we established that the phytohormone content of Stage I tassels and the levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and IAA-glucose were higher in PCU than in PCM plants, whereas contrastingly, the levels of 5-deoxymonopolyl alcohol in PCM were higher than those in PCU. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that differences in TBN may be related to hormone content. Collectively, by combining QTL mapping and RNA-seq analysis, we identified five candidate genes associated with TBN. This study provides theoretical insights into the mechanism of tassel branch development in maize."
37652038,response to Clavibacter michiganense,Genetic and Transcriptomic Dissection of Host Defense to Goss's Bacterial Wilt and Leaf Blight of Maize.,"Goss's wilt, caused by the Gram-positive actinobacterium Clavibacter nebraskensis, is an important bacterial disease of maize. The molecular and genetic mechanisms of resistance to the bacterium, or, in general, Gram-positive bacteria causing plant diseases, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the genetic basis of Goss's wilt through differential gene expression, standard genome-wide association mapping (GWAS), extreme phenotype (XP) GWAS using highly resistant (R) and highly susceptible (S) lines, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using three bi-parental populations, identifying eleven disease association loci. Three loci were validated using near-isogenic lines or recombinant inbred lines. Our analysis indicates that Goss's wilt resistance is highly complex and major resistance genes are not commonly present. RNA sequencing of samples separately pooled from R and S lines with or without bacterial inoculation was performed, enabling identification of common and differential gene responses in R and S lines. Based on expression, in both R and S lines, the photosynthesis pathway was silenced upon infection, while stress-responsive pathways and phytohormone pathways, namely, abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, jasmonate, and gibberellin, were markedly activated. In addition, sixty-five genes showed differential responses (up- or down-regulated) to infection in R and S lines. Combining genetic mapping and transcriptional data, individual candidate genes conferring Goss's wilt resistance were identified. Collectively, aspects of the genetic architecture of Goss's wilt resistance were revealed, providing foundational data for mechanistic studies."
37653869,response to salt; root length,Reshifting Na+ from Shoots into Long Roots Is Associated with Salt Tolerance in Two Contrasting Inbred Maize (Zea mays L.) Lines.,"Maize, as a glycophyte, is hypersensitive to salinity, but the salt response mechanism of maize remains unclear. In this study, the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of two contrasting inbred lines, the salt-tolerant QXH0121 and salt-sensitive QXN233 lines, were investigated in response to salt stress. Under salt stress, the tolerant QXH0121 line exhibited good performance, while in the sensitive QXN233 line, there were negative effects on the growth of the leaves and roots. The most important finding was that QXH0121 could reshift Na+ from shoots into long roots, migrate excess Na+ in shoots to alleviate salt damage to shoots, and also improve K+ retention in shoots, which were closely associated with the enhanced expression levels of ZmHAK1 and ZmNHX1 in QXH0121 compared to those in QXN233 under salt stress. Additionally, QXH0121 leaves accumulated more proline, soluble protein, and sugar contents and had higher SOD activity levels than those observed in QXN233, which correlated with the upregulation of ZmP5CR, ZmBADH, ZmTPS1, and ZmSOD4 in QXH0121 leaves. These were the main causes of the higher salt tolerance of QXH0121 in contrast to QXN233. These results broaden our knowledge about the underlying mechanism of salt tolerance in different maize varieties, providing novel insights into breeding maize with a high level of salt resistance."
37658795,drought response; response to foxtail mosaic virus,Silencing ZmPP2C-A10 with a foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) derived vector benefits maize growth and development following water limitation,"Global climate change is causing more frequent and severe droughts, which can have negative impacts on plant growth and crop productivity. Under drought conditions, plants produce the hormone ABA (abscisic acid), which regulates adaptive responses, such as stomatal closure and root elongation. Plant viruses have been used in the lab to convey new traits to plants and could also be used to increase production of ABA or to enhance downstream plant drought resistance responses. 
    In this study, foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) was used to silence ZmPP2C-A10, a negative regulator of ABA signalling, in maize (Zea mays L.). Both silenced and control plants were exposed to an 8-day drought treatment, followed by a 30-day period of rewatering, after which indicators of drought resistance were measured. 
    After drought treatment, we observed a nearly twofold increase in expression of a stress-mitigation gene, ZmRAB17, reduced chlorophyll fluorescence changes (indicator of stress), and increased plant biomass and development in the ZmPP2C-A10-silenced maize compared to controls. 
    These results demonstrate that the FoMV system can be used to silence endogenous expression of ZmPP2C-A10 and increase maize tolerance to drought. This could offer a useful tool to improve crop traits and reduce yield loss during the growing season."
37662159,response to heat stress,Genes and pathways correlated with heat stress responses and heat tolerance in maize kernels.,"Global warming leads to frequent extreme weather, especially the extreme heat events, which threating the safety of maize production. Here we selected a pair of maize inbred lines, PF5411-1 and LH150, with significant differences in heat tolerance at kernel development stage. The two maize inbred lines were treated with heat stress at kernel development stage. Compared with the control groups, transcriptomic analysis identified 770 common up- and down-regulated genes between PF5411-1 and LH150 under heat stress conditions, and 41 putative TFs were predicted. Based on the interaction term of the two-factorial design, we also identified 6,744 differentially regulated genes between LH150 and PF5411-1, 111 common up-regulated and 141 common down-regulated genes were overlapped with the differentially regulated genes, respectively. Combined with proteins and metabolites data, several key pathways including seven differentially regulated genes were highly correlated with the heat tolerance of maize kernels. The first is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway ko04141: protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, four small heat shock protein (sHSP) genes were enriched in this pathway, participating with the process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The second one is the myricetin biosynthesis pathway, a differentially regulated protein, flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase [EC:1.14.14.81], catalyzed the synthesis of myricetin. The third one is the raffinose metabolic pathway, one differentially regulated gene encoded the raffinose synthase controlled the synthesis of raffinose, high level of raffinose enhances the heat tolerance of maize kernels. And the last one is the ethylene signaling pathway. Taken together, our work identifies many genes responded to heat stress in maize kernels, and finds out seven genes and four pathways highly correlated with heat tolerance of maize kernels."
37662167,response to Pythium spp.; response to stalk rot,Genome-wide association study of maize resistance to Pythium aristosporum stalk rot.,"Stalk rot, a severe and widespread soil-borne disease in maize, globally reduces yield and quality. Recent documentation reveals that Pythium aristosporum has emerged as one of the dominant causal agents of maize stalk rot. However, a previous study of maize stalk rot disease resistance mechanisms and breeding had mainly focused on other pathogens, neglecting P. aristosporum. To mitigate crop loss, resistance breeding is the most economical and effective strategy against this disease. This study involved characterizing resistance in 295 inbred lines using the drilling inoculation method and genotyping them via sequencing. By combining with population structure, disease resistance phenotype, and genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified 39 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with P. aristosporum stalk rot resistance by utilizing six statistical methods. Bioinformatics analysis of these SNPs revealed 69 potential resistance genes, among which Zm00001d051313 was finally evaluated for its roles in host defense response to P. aristosporum infection. Through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) verification and physiological index determination, we found that transient silencing of Zm00001d051313 promoted P. aristosporum infection, indicating a positive regulatory role of this gene in maize's antifungal defense mechanism. Therefore, these findings will help advance our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of maize defense to Pythium stalk rot."
37667417,response to salt; biomass yield,Salinity stress tolerance prediction for biomass-related traits in maize (Zea mays L.) using genome-wide markers.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the third most important cereal crop after rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Salinity stress significantly affects vegetative biomass and grain yield and, therefore, reduces the food and silage productivity of maize. Selecting salt-tolerant genotypes is a cumbersome and time-consuming process that requires meticulous phenotyping. To predict salt tolerance in maize, we estimated breeding values for four biomass-related traits, including shoot length, shoot weight, root length, and root weight under salt-stressed and controlled conditions. A five-fold cross-validation method was used to select the best model among genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), ridge-regression BLUP (rrBLUP), extended GBLUP, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian ridge regression, BayesA, BayesB, and BayesC. Examination of the effect of different marker densities on prediction accuracy revealed that a set of low-density single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained through filtering based on a combination of analysis of variance and linkage disequilibrium provided the best prediction accuracy for all the traits. The average prediction accuracy in cross-validations ranged from 0.46 to 0.77 across the four derived traits. The GBLUP, rrBLUP, and all Bayesian models except BayesB demonstrated comparable levels of prediction accuracy that were superior to the other modeling approaches. These findings provide a roadmap for the deployment and optimization of genomic selection in breeding for salt tolerance in maize."
37667418,Chromosome,Whole-genome versus per-chromosome targeted recombination: Simulations and predicted gains in maize with an integer programming model.,"Per-chromosome targeted recombination, with one to two recombinations at specific marker intervals on each chromosome, doubles the predicted genetic gains in biparental populations. We developed an integer programing model to identify where a fixed number of targeted recombinations should occur across the whole genome, without restrictions on the number of targeted recombinations on each chromosome. We compared whole-genome and per-chromosome targeted recombination in 392 biparental maize (Zea mays L.) populations and in simulation experiments. For yield, moisture, test weight, and a simulated trait controlled by 2000 quantitative trait loci (QTL), predicted gains were 8%-9% larger with 10 targeted recombinations across the entire genome than with one targeted recombination on each of the 10 chromosomes. With whole-genome targeted recombination, the number of recombinations on a given chromosome was correlated (r = 0.76-0.91) with the chromosome size (in cM). Simulation results suggested that previous results on gains from targeted recombination relative to nontargeted recombination were too optimistic by around 20%. Because the underlying QTL are unknown, studies on targeted recombination have relied on genomewide marker effects as proxies for QTL information. The simulation results indicated a 25% (for 10 recombinations) to 33% (for 20 recombinations) reduction in response due to the use of genomewide marker effects as proxies for QTL information. Overall, the results indicated that the integer programming model we developed is useful for increasing both the predicted and true gains from targeted recombination, but the predicted gains are likely to overestimate the true gains."
37674314,response to climate change,Redesigning crop varieties to win the race between climate change and food security.,"Climate change poses daunting challenges to agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and more frequent extreme events have already demonstrated their effects on local, regional, and global agricultural systems. Crop varieties that withstand climate-related stresses and are suitable for cultivation in innovative cropping systems will be crucial to maximize risk avoidance, productivity, and profitability under climate-changed environments. We surveyed 588 expert stakeholders to predict current and novel traits that may be essential for future pearl millet, sorghum, maize, groundnut, cowpea, and common bean varieties, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We then review the current progress and prospects for breeding three prioritized future-essential traits for each of these crops. Experts predict that most current breeding priorities will remain important, but that rates of genetic gain must increase to keep pace with climate challenges and consumer demands. Importantly, the predicted future-essential traits include innovative breeding targets that must also be prioritized; for example, 1) optimized rhizosphere microbiome, with benefits for P, N, and water use efficiency, 2) optimized performance across or in specific cropping systems, 3) lower nighttime respiration, 4) improved stover quality, and 5) increased early vigor. We describe cutting-edge tools and approaches to discover, validate, and incorporate novel genetic diversity from exotic germplasm into breeding populations with unprecedented precision, accuracy, and speed, concluding that the greatest challenge to developing crop varieties to win the race between climate change and food security might be our innovativeness in defining and boldness to breed for the traits of tomorrow. 
Short summary: Stress-tolerant crop varieties for cultivation in innovative cropping systems will be crucial under climate-changed environments. A survey of 588 experts predicted traits that will be essential for pearl millet, sorghum, maize, groundnut, cowpea, and common bean, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Our review of the status of breeding and novel approaches to use genetic resources for the prioritized traits concludes that the greatest challenge to developing varieties to win the race between climate change and food security will be our foresight in defining, and boldness to prioritize breeding for future-essential traits."
37676328,drought response,CIMBL55: a repository for maize drought resistance alleles.,"Droughts threaten crop yields worldwide. Compared to other major staple cereal crops, maize (Zea mays) is especially sensitive to drought, which can cause dramatic fluctuations in its yield potential. Natural maize populations contain many superior alleles that can enhance drought resistance through complex regulatory mechanisms. We recently de novo assembled the genome of a prominent drought-resistant maize germplasm, CIMBL55, and systematically dissected the genetic basis for its drought resistance on the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome levels. These analyses revealed 65 favorable drought resistance alleles in CIMBL55. Subsequently, we genetically verified the functions of the drought resistance genes ZmABF4, ZmNAC075, and ZmRtn16 and unraveled the function of ZmRtn16 on a molecular level."
37679604,Anthocyanin content; pericarp color,Sequence variations associated with novel purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn compared to its purple-pericarp maize and white super-sweetcorn parents,"Recently, a novel purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn line, 'Tim1' (A1A1.sh2sh2) was derived from the purple-pericarp maize 'Costa Rica' (A1Sh2.A1Sh2) and white shrunken2 (sh2) super-sweetcorn 'Tims-white' (a1sh2.a1sh2), however, information regarding anthocyanin biosynthesis genes controlling purple colour and sweetness gene is lacking. Specific sequence differences in the CDS (coding DNA sequence) and promoter regions of the anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes, anthocyanin1 (A1), purple aleurone1 (Pr1) and regulatory genes, purple plant1 (Pl1), plant colour1 (B1), coloured1 (R1), and the sweetcorn structural gene, shrunken2 (sh2) were investigated using the publicly available annotated yellow starchy maize, B73 (NAM5.0) as a reference genome. In the CDS region, the A1, Pl1 and R1 gene sequence differences of 'Tim1' and 'Costa Rica' were similar, as they control purple-pericarp pigmentation. However, the B1 gene showed similarity between the 'Tim1' and 'Tims-white' lines, which may indicate that it does not have a role in controlling pericarp colour, unlike the report of a previous study. In the case of the Pr1 gene, in contrast to 'Costa Rica', 6- and 8-bp dinucleotide (TA) repeats were observed in the promoter region of the 'Tims-white' and 'Tim1' lines, respectively, indicating the defective functionality (redder colour in 'Tim1' rather than purple in 'Costa Rica') of the recessive pr1 allele. In sweetcorn, the structural gene (sh2), sequence showed similarity between purple-sweet 'Tim1' and its white-sweet parent 'Tims-white', as both display a shrunken phenotype in their mature kernels. These findings revealed that the developed purple-sweet line is different to the reference yellow-nonsweet line in both the anthocyanin biosynthesis and sweetcorn genes."
37691288,lignin content; response to UV radiation; response to heat stress,Maize and Arabidopsis VAMP726 confers pollen resistance to heat and UV radiation by influencing lignin content in sporopollenin.,"Sporopollenin in pollen cell wall protects male gametophytes from stresses. Phenylpropanoid derivatives, including guaiacyl (G) lignin units, were shown to be structural components of sporopollenin. However, the exact composition of sporopollenin remains to be fully resolved. We analyzed the phenylpropanoid derivatives in sporopollenin of maize and Arabidopsis through thioacidolysis coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of NMR and GC-MS confirmed the presence of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), G and syringyl (S) lignin units in sporopollenin of maize and Arabidopsis. Strikingly, H units account for the majority of lignin monomers in sporopollenin of maize and Arabidopsis. We further performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic basis of maize sporopollenin composition, and revealed a vesicle-associated membrane protein (ZmVAMP726) that is strongly associated with lignin monomer composition in maize sporopollenin. Genetic manipulation of VAMP726 affects not only lignin monomer composition in sporopollenin but also pollen resistance to heat and UV radiation in maize and Arabidopsis, indicating a functional conservation of VAMP726 in monocot and dicot plants. Collectively, our work uncovered new lignin monomers as structural components of sporopollenin, and identified VAMP726 that is involved in sporopollenin composition and pollen resistance to stresses. 
Short summary: Plants have evolved sporopollenin in pollen cell wall to protect male gametophytes. However, its chemical composition remains to be fully resolved. We found that three common lignin monomers are present in sporopollenin derived from maize and Arabidopsis pollen cell wall, and have identified VAMP726 as a genetic regulator of lignin content in sporopollenin. Genetic manipulation of VAMP726 expression greatly affects pollen resistance to heat and UV radiation, representing a promising approach for creating elite crops in a warming world."
37697229,kernel size,Multiomics comparative analysis of the maize large grain mutant tc19 identified pathways related to kernel development.,"Background: The mechanism of grain development in elite maize breeding lines has not been fully elucidated. Grain length, grain width and grain weight are key components of maize grain yield. Previously, using the Chinese elite maize breeding line Chang7-2 and its large grain mutant tc19, we characterized the grain size developmental difference between Chang7-2 and tc19 and performed transcriptomic analysis. 

Results: In this paper, using Chang7-2 and tc19, we performed comparative transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses at different grain development stages. Through proteomics analyses, we found 2884, 505 and 126 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at 14, 21 and 28 days after pollination, respectively. Through metabolomics analysis, we identified 51, 32 and 36 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) at 14, 21 and 28 days after pollination, respectively. Through multiomics comparative analysis, we showed that the phenylpropanoid pathways are influenced at transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic levels in all the three grain developmental stages. 

Conclusion: We identified several genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which may be related to the large grain phenotype of tc19. In summary, our results provided new insights into maize grain development."
37701799,ear morphology,Investigating the genetic basis of maize ear characteristics: a comprehensive genome-wide study utilizing high-throughput phenotypic measurement method and system.,"The morphology of maize ears plays a critical role in the breeding of new varieties and increasing yield. However, the study of traditional ear-related traits alone can no longer meet the requirements of breeding. In this study, 20 ear-related traits, including size, shape, number, and color, were obtained in 407 maize inbred lines at two sites using a high-throughput phenotypic measurement method and system. Significant correlations were found among these traits, particularly the novel trait ear shape (ES), which was correlated with traditional traits: kernel number per row and kernel number per ear. Pairwise comparison tests revealed that the inbred lines of tropical-subtropical were significantly different from other subpopulations in row numbers per ear, kernel numbers per ear, and ear color. A genome-wide association study identified 275, 434, and 362 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Beijing, Sanya, and best linear unbiased prediction scenarios, respectively, explaining 3.78% to 24.17% of the phenotypic variance. Furthermore, 58 candidate genes with detailed functional descriptions common to more than two scenarios were discovered, with 40 genes being associated with color traits on chromosome 1. After analysis of haplotypes, gene expression, and annotated information, several candidate genes with high reliability were identified, including Zm00001d051328 for ear perimeter and width, zma-MIR159f for ear shape, Zm00001d053080 for kernel width and row number per ear, and Zm00001d048373 for the blue color channel of maize kernels in the red-green-blue color model. This study emphasizes the importance of researching novel phenotypic traits in maize by utilizing high-throughput phenotypic measurements. The identified genetic loci enrich the existing genetic studies related to maize ears."
37709955,response to maize rough dwarf virus,A transcription factor ZmGLK36 confers broad resistance to maize rough dwarf disease in cereal crops,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD), caused by maize rough dwarf virus (MRDV) or rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), seriously threatens worldwide production of all major cereal crops, including maize, rice, wheat and barley. Here we report fine mapping and cloning of a previously reported major quantitative trait locus (QTL) (qMrdd2) for RBSDV resistance in maize. Subsequently, we show that qMrdd2 encodes a G2-like transcription factor named ZmGLK36 that promotes resistance to RBSDV by enhancing jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and JA-mediated defence response. We identify a 26-bp indel located in the 5′ UTR of ZmGLK36 that contributes to differential expression and resistance to RBSDV in maize inbred lines. Moreover, we show that ZmDBF2, an AP2/EREBP family transcription factor, directly binds to the 26-bp indel and represses ZmGLK36 expression. We further demonstrate that ZmGLK36 plays a conserved role in conferring resistance to RBSDV in rice and wheat using transgenic or marker-assisted breeding approaches. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of RBSDV resistance and effective strategies to breed RBSDV-resistant cereal crops."
37711294,germination index; seed viability,Non-destructive detection of single-seed viability in maize using hyperspectral imaging technology and multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network.,"The viability of Zea mays seed plays a critical role in determining the yield of corn. Therefore, developing a fast and non-destructive method is essential for rapid and large-scale seed viability detection and is of great significance for agriculture, breeding, and germplasm preservation. In this study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology was used to obtain images and spectral information of maize seeds with different aging stages. To reduce data input and improve model detection speed while obtaining more stable prediction results, successive projections algorithm (SPA) was used to extract key wavelengths that characterize seed viability, then key wavelength images of maize seed were divided into small blocks with 5 pixels ×5 pixels and fed into a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) for further optimizing the discrimination possibility of single-seed viability. The final discriminant result of single-seed viability was determined by comprehensively evaluating the result of all small blocks belonging to the same seed with the voting algorithm. The results showed that the multi-scale 3DCNN model achieved an accuracy of 90.67% for the discrimination of single-seed viability on the test set. Furthermore, an effort to reduce labor and avoid the misclassification caused by human subjective factors, a YOLOv7 model and a Mask R-CNN model were constructed respectively for germination judgment and bud length detection in this study, the result showed that mean average precision (mAP) of YOLOv7 model could reach 99.7%, and the determination coefficient of Mask R-CNN model was 0.98. Overall, this study provided a feasible solution for detecting maize seed viability using HSI technology and multi-scale 3DCNN, which was crucial for large-scale screening of viable seeds. This study provided theoretical support for improving planting quality and crop yield."
37716664,response to cold stress,The G protein-coupled receptor COLD1 promotes chilling tolerance in maize during germination.,"The geographic range and yield of the staple crop maize (Zea mays L.) are both strongly limited by low-temperature conditions. One of the most economical and effective measures for improvement of maize production is chilling tolerance enhancement. In this study, a chilling-tolerance gene in maize, ZmCOLD1, was cloned and characterized. This gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is localized to the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZmCOLD1, SNP2738, was found to confer chilling tolerance and to have promoted maize adaptations during speciation from teosinte. Overexpression of the excellent haplotype ZmCOLD1Hap11 significantly enhanced chilling tolerance, whereas knocking down ZmCOLD1 increased sensitivity to low temperatures during the germination and seedling stages. ZmCOLD1 was associated with an influx of extracellular Ca2+, increases in abscisic acid content, and decreases in gibberellic acid and indole-3-acetic acid content under low temperatures during the germination stage. ZmCOLD1 interacted with the G protein α subunit ZmCT2 at the plasma membrane, and ZmCT2 interacted with ZmLanCL in the nucleus. These proteins are components of the chilling tolerance signaling pathway in maize that are triggered by abscisic acid and photosynthesis. These results offer novel strategies for improvement of chilling tolerance in key crop species."
37716995,response to Ustilago maydis,Ustilago maydis PR-1-like protein has evolved two distinct domains for dual virulence activities,"The diversification of effector function, driven by a co-evolutionary arms race, enables pathogens to establish compatible interactions with hosts. Structurally conserved plant pathogenesis-related PR-1 and PR-1-like (PR-1L) proteins are involved in plant defense and fungal virulence, respectively. It is unclear how fungal PR-1L counters plant defense. Here, we show that Ustilago maydis UmPR-1La and yeast ScPRY1, with conserved phenolic resistance functions, are Ser/Thr-rich region mediated cell-surface localization proteins. However, UmPR-1La has gained specialized activity in sensing phenolics and eliciting hyphal-like formation to guide fungal growth in plants. Additionally, U. maydis hijacks maize cathepsin B-like 3 (CatB3) to release functional CAPE-like peptides by cleaving UmPR-1La’s conserved CNYD motif, subverting plant CAPE-primed immunity and promoting fungal virulence. Surprisingly, CatB3 avoids cleavage of plant PR-1s, despite the presence of the same conserved CNYD motif. Our work highlights that UmPR-1La has acquired additional dual roles to suppress plant defense and sustain the infection process of fungal pathogens."
37719228,root morphology,Integrated phenotyping of root and shoot growth dynamics in maize reveals specific interaction patterns in inbreds and hybrids and in response to drought.,"In recent years, various automated methods for plant phenotyping addressing roots or shoots have been developed and corresponding platforms have been established to meet the diverse requirements of plant research and breeding. However, most platforms are only either able to phenotype shoots or roots of plants but not both simultaneously. This substantially limits the opportunities offered by a joint assessment of the growth and development dynamics of both organ systems, which are highly interdependent. In order to overcome these limitations, a root phenotyping installation was integrated into an existing automated non-invasive high-throughput shoot phenotyping platform. Thus, the amended platform is now capable of conducting high-throughput phenotyping at the whole-plant level, and it was used to assess the vegetative root and shoot growth dynamics of five maize inbred lines and four hybrids thereof, as well as the responses of five inbred lines to progressive drought stress. The results showed that hybrid vigour (heterosis) occurred simultaneously in roots and shoots and was detectable as early as 4 days after transplanting (4 DAT; i.e., 8 days after seed imbibition) for estimated plant height (EPH), total root length (TRL), and total root volume (TRV). On the other hand, growth dynamics responses to progressive drought were different in roots and shoots. While TRV was significantly reduced 10 days after the onset of the water deficit treatment, the estimated shoot biovolume was significantly reduced about 6 days later, and EPH showed a significant decrease even 2 days later (8 days later than TRV) compared with the control treatment. In contrast to TRV, TRL initially increased in the water deficit period and decreased much later (not earlier than 16 days after the start of the water deficit treatment) compared with the well-watered plants. This may indicate an initial response of the plants to water deficit by forming longer but thinner roots before growth was inhibited by the overall water deficit. The magnitude and the dynamics of the responses were genotype-dependent, as well as under the influence of the water consumption, which was related to plant size."
37725401,response to heat stress,Maize MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 20 mediates high-temperature–regulated stomatal movement,"High temperature induces stomatal opening; however, uncontrolled stomatal opening is dangerous for plants in response to high temperature. We identified a high-temperature sensitive (hts) mutant from the ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced maize (Zea mays) mutant library that is linked to a single base change in MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 20 (ZmMPK20). Our data demonstrated that hts mutants exhibit substantially increased stomatal opening and water loss rate, as well as decreased thermotolerance, compared to wild-type plants under high temperature. ZmMPK20-knockout mutants showed similar phenotypes as hts mutants. Overexpression of ZmMPK20 decreased stomatal apertures, water loss rate, and enhanced plant thermotolerance. Additional experiments showed that ZmMPK20 interacts with MAP KINASE KINASE 9 (ZmMKK9) and E3 ubiquitin ligase RPM1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 2 (ZmRIN2), a maize homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RIN2. ZmMPK20 prevented ZmRIN2 degradation by inhibiting ZmRIN2 self-ubiquitination. ZmMKK9 phosphorylated ZmMPK20 and enhanced the inhibitory effect of ZmMPK20 on ZmRIN2 degradation. Moreover, we employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to silence ZmMKK9 and ZmRIN2 in maize and heterologously overexpressed ZmMKK9 or ZmRIN2 in Arabidopsis. Our findings demonstrated that ZmMKK9 and ZmRIN2 play negative regulatory roles in high-temperature–induced stomatal opening. Accordingly, we propose that the ZmMKK9–ZmMPK20–ZmRIN2 cascade negatively regulates high-temperature–induced stomatal opening and balances water loss and leaf temperature, thus enhancing plant thermotolerance."
37725833,response to Azospirillum brasilense,Effects on gene expression during maize-Azospirillum interaction in the presence of a plant-specific inhibitor of indole-3-acetic acid production.,"Amongst the sustainable alternatives to increase maize production is the use of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Azospirillum brasilense is one of the most well-known PGPB being able to fix nitrogen and produce phytohormones, especially indole-3-acetic acid - IAA. This work investigated if there is any contribution of the bacterium to the plant's IAA levels, and how it affects the plant. To inhibit plant IAA production, yucasin, an inhibitor of the TAM/YUC pathway, was applied. Plantlets' IAA concentration was evaluated through HPLC and dual RNA-Seq was used to analyze gene expression. Statistical differences between the group treated with yucasin and the other groups showed that A. brasilense inoculation was able to prevent the phenotype caused by yucasin concerning the number of lateral roots. Genes involved in the auxin and ABA response pathways, auxin efflux transport, and the cell cycle were regulated by the presence of the bacterium, yucasin, or both. Genes involved in the response to biotic/abiotic stress, plant disease resistance, and a D-type cellulose synthase changed their expression pattern among two sets of comparisons in which A. brasilense acted as treatment. The results suggest that A. brasilense interferes with the expression of many maize genes through an IAA-independent pathway."
37725963,drought response,"ZmCCT regulates drought tolerance in maize by interacting with ZmFra a 1, E3 ligase ZmWIPF2 and auxin response factor ZmAux/IAA8.","Abiotic stressors are widespread in plants and can affect their growth, productivity, and quality. Previously, the maize transcription factor ZmCCT was been proved to be involved in the photoperiod response, delayed flowering and quantitative resistance to Gibberella stalk rot. In this study, we demonstrate that ZmCCT can regulate plant drought stress. ZmCCT physically interacted with ZmFra a 1, ZmWIPF2, and ZmAux/IAA8, which localised to the cytomembrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid screen in response to abiotic stress. Notably, ZmCCT recruits ZmWIPF2 to the nucleus, which has strong E3 self-ubiquitination activity dependent on its RING-H2 finger domain in vitro. When treated with higher indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)/abscisic acid (ABA) ratios, the height and root length of Y331-ΔTE increased, and this resulted in an increase in auxin and ABA tolerance. In vivo, ZmCCT promoted IAA biosynthesis in ZmCCT-overexpressed Arabidopsis. RNA-seq and DAP-seq analyses showed that ZmCCT can regulate the expression of ZmRD17, ZmAFP3, ZmPP2C and ZmARR16 under drought stress. Our finding provides a detailed overview of the molecular mechanism controlling ZmCCT functions and highlights that it HAS multiple roles in promoting stress tolerance."
37727018,response to Fusarium top rot,Isolation and Identification of the Causal Agent of Top Rot and the Genetic Architecture of Resistance in Maize.,"In maize (Zea mays), the disease known as ""top rot"" causes necrosis of the upper plant, disrupts tassel formation and pollen dispersal, and decreases yield. However, the causal agent, mode of pathogen infestation, and genetic architecture of resistance in maize remain to be explored. Here, to identify the causal agent, we isolated 41 fungal strains from maize plants infected with top rot. We classified these strains into six groups based on their morphological and molecular characteristics. Four species of Fusarium (F. fujikuroi, F. equiseti, F. proliferatum, and F. verticillioides) were able to cause top rot, with F. fujikuroi and F. equiseti being the main causal agents. Microscopic observations of a F. fujikuroi strain labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein revealed that this pathogen first colonizes the stomata of leaves and then spreads through intercellular spaces, creating an expanding lesion. To dissect the genetic basis of maize resistance to top rot, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using a recombinant inbred line population constructed from the resistant parent LDC-1 and the susceptible parent YS501. Under natural conditions in Yangzhou and Hainan, we detected three and five QTLs, respectively, with qRtr7-1, located on chromosome 7, detected in both environments. Using inoculated seedlings, we detected three QTLs for resistance on chromosomes 1, 5, and 8. These results improve our understanding of maize top rot and provide a theoretical basis for its control."
37731154,ear development,Dynamic transcriptome landscape of developing maize ear,"Seed number and harvesting ability in maize (Zea mays L.) are primarily determined by the architecture of female inflorescence, namely the ear. Therefore, ear morphogenesis contributes to grain yield and as such is one of the key target traits during maize breeding. However, the molecular networks of this highly dynamic and complex grain-bearing inflorescence remain largely unclear. As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we performed a high-spatio-temporal-resolution investigation of transcriptomes using 130 ear samples collected from developing ears with length from 0.1 mm to 19.0 cm. Comparisons of these mRNA populations indicated that these spatio-temporal transcriptomes were clearly separated into four distinct stages stages I, II, III, and IV. A total of 23 793 genes including 1513 transcription factors (TFs) were identified in the investigated developing ears. During the stage I of ear morphogenesis, 425 genes were predicted to be involved in a co-expression network established by eight hub TFs. Moreover, 9714 ear-specific genes were identified in the seven kinds of meristems. Additionally, 527 genes including 59 TFs were identified as especially expressed in ear and displayed high temporal specificity. These results provide a high-resolution atlas of gene activity during ear development and help to unravel the regulatory modules associated with the differentiation of the ear in maize."
37737036,plant height,Parallel tuning of semi-dwarfism via differential splicing of Brachytic1 in commercial maize and smallholder sorghum.,"In the current genomic era, the search and deployment of new semi-dwarf alleles have continued to develop better plant types in all cereals. We characterized an agronomically optimal semi-dwarf mutation in Zea mays L. and a parallel polymorphism in Sorghum bicolor L. We cloned the maize brachytic1 (br1-Mu) allele by a modified PCR-based Sequence Amplified Insertion Flanking Fragment (SAIFF) approach. Histology and RNA-Seq elucidated the mechanism of semi-dwarfism. GWAS linked a sorghum plant height QTL with the Br1 homolog by resequencing a West African sorghum landraces panel. The semi-dwarf br1-Mu allele encodes an MYB transcription factor78 that positively regulates stalk cell elongation by interacting with the polar auxin pathway. Semi-dwarfism is due to differential splicing and low functional Br1 wild-type transcript expression. The sorghum ortholog, SbBr1, co-segregates with the major plant height QTL qHT7.1 and is alternatively spliced. The high frequency of the Sbbr1 allele in African landraces suggests that African smallholder farmers used the semi-dwarf allele to improve plant height in sorghum long before efforts to introduce Green Revolution-style varieties in the 1960s. Surprisingly, variants for differential splicing of Brachytic1 were found in both commercial maize and smallholder sorghum, suggesting parallel tuning of plant architecture across these systems."
37739122,kernel weight; kernel size,Molecular mechanisms controlling grain size and weight and their biotechnological breeding applications in maize and other cereal crops,"Background: Cereal crops are a primary energy source for humans. Grain size and weight affect both evolutionary fitness and grain yield of cereals. Although studies on gene mining and molecular mechanisms controlling grain size and weight are constantly emerging in cereal crops, only a few systematic reviews on the underlying molecular mechanisms and their breeding applications are available so far. 
Aim: of review: This review provides a general state-of-the-art overview of molecular mechanisms and targeted strategies for improving grain size and weight of cereals as well as insights for future yield-improving biotechnology-assisted breeding. 
Key scientific concepts of review: In this review, the evolution of research on grain size and weight over the last 20 years is traced based on a bibliometric analysis of 1158 publications and the main signaling pathways and transcriptional factors involved are summarized. In addition, the roles of post-transcriptional regulation and photosynthetic product accumulation affecting grain size and weight in maize and rice are outlined. State-of-the-art strategies for discovering novel genes related to grain size and weight in maize and other cereal crops as well as advanced breeding biotechnology strategies being used for improving yield including marker-assisted selection, genomic selection, transgenic breeding, and genome editing are also discussed."
37739867,inflorescence development,Hormonal regulation of inflorescence and intercalary meristems in grasses.,"Hormones played a fundamental role in improvement of yield in cereal grasses. Natural variants affecting gibberellic acid (GA) and auxin pathways were used to breed semi-dwarf varieties of rice, wheat, and sorghum, during the ""Green Revolution"" in the 20th century. Since then, variants with altered GA and cytokinin homeostasis have been used to breed cereals with increased grain number. These yield improvements were enabled by hormonal regulation of intercalary and inflorescence meristems. Recent advances have highlighted additional pathways, beyond the traditional CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway, in the regulation of auxin and cytokinin in inflorescence meristems, and have expanded our understanding of the role of GA in intercalary meristems."
37741480,response to salt,The ZmbHLH32-ZmIAA9-ZmARF1 module regulates salt tolerance in maize.,"The growth and productivity of maize (Zea mays), along with other crop plants, can be significantly hindered by salt stress. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism underlying salt tolerance in maize has yet to be fully elucidated. Hence, it was attempted to identify ZmIAA9, a member of the maize Aux/IAA gene family, as a positive regulator of salt tolerance in maize, which was accompanied by the increased ROS detoxification and elevated transcript abundances of ROS scavenging genes. Molecular and biochemical assays have provided compelling evidence that ZmbHLH32, a transcription factor belonging to the bHLH family, was capable of binding directly to the promoter region of ZmIAA9, thereby activating its expression. This interaction between ZmbHLH32 and ZmIAA9 could be critical for the regulation of salt tolerance in maize. As expected, overexpression of ZmbHLH32 led to the enhanced salt tolerance. In contrast, decreased salt tolerance was attained after application of knockout mutants of ZmbHLH32. Furthermore, ZmARF1, which could act as a downstream of ZmIAA9, was found to physically interact with ZmIAA9 and repress the expression levels of ROS scavenging genes. Thus, our work uncovers a novel mechanism of ZmbHLH32-ZmIAA9-ZmARF1 module-mediated salt tolerance in maize, which can be exploited for breeding salt-tolerant maize varieties."
37741865,Biotic stress response,Integrated transcriptomic meta-analysis and comparative artificial intelligence models in maize under biotic stress,"Biotic stress imposed by pathogens, including fungal, bacterial, and viral, can cause heavy damage leading to yield reduction in maize. Therefore, the identification of resistant genes paves the way to the development of disease-resistant cultivars and is essential for reliable production in maize. Identifying different gene expression patterns can deepen our perception of maize resistance to disease. This study includes machine learning and deep learning-based application for classifying genes expressed under normal and biotic stress in maize. Machine learning algorithms used are Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Ensemble, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). A Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) based network with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is proposed for gene classification with deep learning. To increase the performance of these algorithms, feature selection is made from the raw gene features through the Relief feature selection algorithm. The obtained finding indicated the efficacy of BiLSTM over other machine learning algorithms. Some top genes ((S)-beta-macrocarpene synthase, zealexin A1 synthase, polyphenol oxidase I, chloroplastic, pathogenesis-related protein 10, CHY1, chitinase chem 5, barwin, and uncharacterized LOC100273479 were proved to be differentially upregulated under biotic stress condition."
37743123,leaf development,C4 leaf development and evolution.,"C4 photosynthesis is more efficient than C3 photosynthesis for two reasons. First, C4 plants have evolved efficient C4 enzymes to suppress wasteful photorespiration and enhance CO2 fixation. Second, C4 leaves have Kranz anatomy in which the veins are surrounded by one layer of bundle sheath (BS) cells and one layer of mesophyll (M) cells. The BS and M cells are functionally well differentiated and also well coordinated for rapid assimilation of atmospheric CO2 and transport of photo-assimilates between the two types of cells. Recent comparative transcriptomics of developing M and BS cells in young maize embryonic leaves revealed not only potential regulators of BS and M cell differentiation but also rapid early BS cell differentiation whereas slower, more prolonged M cell differentiation, contrary to the traditional view of a far simpler process of M cell development. Moreover, new upstream regulators of Kranz anatomy development have been identified and a number of gene co-expression modules for early vascular development have been inferred. Also, a candidate gene regulatory network associated with Kranz anatomy and vascular development has been constructed. Additionally, how whole genome duplication (WGD) may facilitate C4 evolution has been studied and the reasons for why the same WGD event led to successful C4 evolution in Gynandropsis gynandra but not in the sister species Tarenaya hassleriana have been proposed. Finally, new future research directions are suggested."
37761872,response to western corn rootworm; response to fall armyworm,Maize OPR2 and LOX10 Mediate Defense against Fall Armyworm and Western Corn Rootworm by Tissue-Specific Regulation of Jasmonic Acid and Ketol Metabolism,"Foliage-feeding fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) and root-feeding western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) are maize (Zea mays L.) pests that cause significant yield losses. Jasmonic acid (JA) plays a pivotal defense role against insects. 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) is converted into JA by peroxisome-localized OPDA reductases (OPR). However, little is known about the physiological functions of cytoplasmic OPRs. Here, we show that disruption of ZmOPR2 reduced wound-induced JA production and defense against FAW while accumulating more JA catabolites. Overexpression of ZmOPR2 in Arabidopsis enhanced JA production and defense against beet armyworm (BAW; Spodoptera exigua). In addition, lox10opr2 double mutants were more susceptible than either single mutant, suggesting that ZmOPR2 and ZmLOX10 uniquely and additively contributed to defense. In contrast to the defensive roles of ZmOPR2 and ZmLOX10 in leaves, single mutants did not display any alteration in root herbivory defense against WCR. Feeding on lox10opr2 double mutants resulted in increased WCR mortality associated with greater herbivory-induced production of insecticidal death acids and ketols. Thus, ZmOPR2 and ZmLOX10 cooperatively inhibit the synthesis of these metabolites during herbivory by WCR. We conclude that ZmOPR2 and ZmLOX10 regulate JA-mediated resistance in leaves against FAW while suppressing insecticidal oxylipin synthesis in roots during WCR infestation."
37761911,response to salt,Using High-Throughput Phenotyping Analysis to Decipher the Phenotypic Components and Genetic Architecture of Maize Seedling Salt Tolerance,"Soil salinization is a worldwide problem that limits agricultural production. It is important to understand the salt stress tolerance ability of maize seedlings and explore the underlying related genetic resources. In this study, we used a high-throughput phenotyping platform with a 3D laser sensor (Planteye F500) to identify the digital biomass, plant height and normalized vegetation index under normal and saline conditions at multiple time points. The result revealed that a three-leaf period (T3) was identified as the key period for the phenotypic variation in maize seedlings under salt stress. Moreover, we mapped the salt-stress-related SNPs and identified candidate genes in the natural population via a genome-wide association study. A total of 44 candidate genes were annotated, including 26 candidate genes under normal conditions and 18 candidate genes under salt-stressed conditions. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a high-throughput phenotyping platform to accurately, continuously quantify morphological traits of maize seedlings in different growing environments. And the phenotype and genetic information of this study provided a theoretical basis for the breeding of salt-resistant maize varieties and the study of salt-resistant genes."
37765455,phosphorus uptake,Phosphorus Acquisition Efficiency and Transcriptomic Changes in Maize Plants Treated with Two Lignohumates,"Lignohumates are increasing in popularity in agriculture, but their chemistry and effects on plants vary based on the source and processing. The present study evaluated the ability of two humates (H1 and H2) to boost maize plant performance under different phosphorus (P) availability (25 and 250 μM) conditions in hydroponics, while understanding the underlying mechanisms. Humates differed in chemical composition, as revealed via elemental analysis, phenol and phytohormone content, and thermal and spectroscopic analyses. H1 outperformed H2 in triggering plant responses to low phosphorus by enhancing phosphatase and phytase enzymes, P acquisition efficiency, and biomass production. It contained higher levels of endogenous auxins, cytokinins, and abscisic acid, likely acting together to stimulate plant growth. H1 also improved the plant antioxidant capacity, thus potentially increasing plant resilience to external stresses. Both humates increased the nitrogen (N) content and acted as biostimulants for P and N acquisition. Consistent with the physiological and biochemical data, H1 upregulated genes involved in growth, hormone signaling and defense in all plants, and in P recycling particularly under low-P conditions. In conclusion, H1 showed promising potential for effective plant growth and nutrient utilization, especially in low-P plants, involving hormonal modulation, antioxidant enhancement, the stimulation of P uptake and P-recycling mechanisms."
37769875,response to heat stress,Expression of maize OXS2a in Arabidopsis stunts plant growth but enhances heat tolerance,"As plants encounter various environmental stresses, judicial allocation of resources to stress response is crucial for plant fitness. The plant OXS2 (OXIDATIVE STRESS 2) family has been reported to play important roles in growth regulation and stress response. Here, we report that the maize OXS2 family member ZmOXS2a when expressed in Arabidopsis retards growth including delayed flowering, but improves heat tolerance. ZmOXS2a can be found in the cytoplasm, nucleus and PBs/P bodies (mRNA processing bodies), but heat treatment induces higher accumulation in the PBs. Deletion of ARR (arginine rich region) and TZF (tandem zinc finger) domains for high-affinity RNA-binding reduced PBs accumulation of ZmOXS2a; and unlike ZmOXS2a, expression of this deletion mutant gene affected neither Arabidopsis growth nor heat tolerance. This suggests that ZmOXS2a might be involved in RNA degradation, which would also account for the larger amount of down-regulated genes found in ZmOXS2a expressing lines. Furthermore, 240 of 890 down-regulated genes contain ARE (AU-rich elements) in the mRNA 3’UTR that might be potential targets of ZmOXS2a. Expression of ZmOXS2a also disturbs the response to ABA (abscisic acid) and cytokinin, as GO (gene ontology) analysis shows that 50 and 15 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) are enriched in the GO term for ABA and cytokinin responses, respectively. ZmOXS2a expression lines are more sensitive to ABA, but less sensitive to cytokinin. It is likely that ZmOXS2a promotes the degradation of the mRNA of down-regulated genes containing ARE, which consequently perturbs the hormone pathways that affect stress response-related plant growth. 
Highlights: • Constitutive expression of ZmOXS2a in Arabidopsis retards growth but improves heat tolerance. • Deletion of ARR and TZF domains for high-affinity RNA-binding reduces localization to the PBs and restores wild type phenotype. • Constitutive expression of ZmOXS2a in Arabidopsis down-regulates 890 genes and 27% of them contain ARE. • Constitutive expression of ZmOXS2a alters expression of ABA and cytokinin regulated genes and the transgenic lines are more sensitive to ABA but less sensitive to cytokinin."
37770752,days to flowering,"Expression Levels of Flowering Time Genes (CONZ1, GIGZ1A, GIGZ1B, FKF1A, and FKF1B) in Seedlings under Long-Day Conditions Differentiates Early and Late Zea mays L. Lines.","Phenophase durations, including the timing of flowering and ripeness, were characterized in 20 inbred lines of the maize Zea mays L. Expression of key flowering initiation genes (CONZ1, GIGZ1a, GIGZ1b, ZmFKF1a, and ZmFKF1b) under long-photoperiod conditions was studied in seedlings of six maize lines that differed in ripeness time. Significantly lower transcription levels of all of the five genes were found in early-ripening lines compared with late-ripening lines. Similar expression patterns were observed for the GIGZ1a and GIGZ1b paralogous genes, while ZmFKF1a significantly predominated in expression over its paralog ZmFKF1b."
37786281,nitrogen use efficiency; grain yield,ZmNRT1.1B (ZmNPF6.6) determines nitrogen use efficiency via regulation of nitrate transport and signalling in maize.,"Nitrate (NO3 - ) is crucial for optimal plant growth and development and often limits crop productivity under low availability. In comparison with model plant Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanisms underlying NO3 - acquisition and utilization remain largely unclear in maize. In particular, only a few genes have been exploited to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Here, we demonstrated that NO3 - -inducible ZmNRT1.1B (ZmNPF6.6) positively regulated NO3 - -dependent growth and NUE in maize. We showed that the tandem duplicated proteoform ZmNRT1.1C is irrelevant to maize seedling growth under NO3 - supply; however, the loss of function of ZmNRT1.1B significantly weakened plant growth under adequate NO3 - supply under both hydroponic and field conditions. The 15 N-labelled NO3 - absorption assay indicated that ZmNRT1.1B mediated the high-affinity NO3 - -transport and root-to-shoot NO3 - translocation. Transcriptome analysis further showed, upon NO3 - supply, ZmNRT1.1B promotes cytoplasmic-to-nuclear shuttling of ZmNLP3.1 (ZmNLP8), which co-regulates the expression of genes involved in NO3 - response, cytokinin biosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Remarkably, overexpression of ZmNRT1.1B in modern maize hybrids improved grain yield under N-limiting fields. Taken together, our study revealed a crucial role of ZmNRT1.1B in high-affinity NO3 - transport and signalling and offers valuable genetic resource for breeding N use efficient high-yield cultivars."
37787439,Stress response,Striking a growth-defense balance: Stress regulators that function in maize development.,"Maize (Zea mays) cultivation is strongly affected by both abiotic and biotic stress, leading to reduced growth and productivity. It has recently become clear that regulators of plant stress responses, including the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ET), and jasmonic acid (JA), together with reactive oxygen species (ROS), shape plant growth and development. Beyond their well-established functions in stress responses, these molecules play crucial roles in balancing growth and defense, which must be finely tuned to achieve high yields in crops while maintaining some level of defense. In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent research on the developmental functions of stress regulators, focusing specifically on maize. By unraveling the contributions of these regulators to maize development, we present new avenues for enhancing maize cultivation and growth while highlighting the potential risks associated with manipulating stress regulators to enhance grain yields in the face of environmental challenges."
37792967,nuclear male sterility,CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of 14 lipid metabolic genes reveals a sporopollenin metabolon ZmPKSB-ZmTKPR1-1/-2 required for pollen exine formation in maize.,"Lipid biosynthesis and transport are essential for plant male reproduction. Compared with Arabidopsis and rice, relatively fewer maize lipid metabolic genic male-sterility (GMS) genes have been identified, and the sporopollenin metabolon in maize anther remains unknown. Here, we identified two maize GMS genes, ZmTKPR1-1 and ZmTKPR1-2, by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of 14 lipid metabolic genes with anther stage-specific expression patterns. Among them, tkpr1-1/-2 double mutants displayed complete male sterility with delayed tapetum degradation and abortive pollen. ZmTKPR1-1 and ZmTKPR1-2 encode tetraketide α-pyrone reductases and have catalytic activities in reducing tetraketide α-pyrone produced by ZmPKSB (polyketide synthase B). Several conserved catalytic sites (S128/130, Y164/166 and K168/170 in ZmTKPR1-1/-2) are essential for their enzymatic activities. Both ZmTKPR1-1 and ZmTKPR1-2 are directly activated by ZmMYB84, and their encoded proteins are localized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclei. Based on protein structure prediction, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical assays, the sporopollenin biosynthetic metabolon ZmPKSB-ZmTKPR1-1/-2 was identified to control pollen exine formation in maize anther. Although ZmTKPR1-1/-2 and ZmPKSB formed a protein complex, their mutants showed different, even opposite, defective phenotypes of anther cuticle and pollen exine. Our findings discover new maize GMS genes that can contribute to male-sterility line-assisted maize breeding and also provide new insights into the metabolon-regulated sporopollenin biosynthesis in maize anther."
37803273,drought response,Molecular mechanisms of drought resistance using genome-wide association mapping in maize (Zea mays L.),"Background: Drought is a critical abiotic stress that influences maize yield and reduces grain yield when it occurs at the flowering or filling stage. To dissect the genetic architecture of grain yield under drought stress (DS), a genome-wide association analysis was conducted in a maize population composed of diverse inbred lines from five locations under well-watered and DS conditions at flowering in 2019 and 2020. 
Results: Using a fixed and random model circulating probability unification model, a total of 147 loci associated with grain yield or the drought resistance index (DRI) were identified, of which 54 loci were associated with a DRI with an average phenotypic variation explanation of 4.03%. Further, 10 of these loci explained more than 10% of the phenotypic variation. By integrating two public transcriptome datasets, 22 differentially expressed genes were considered as candidate genes, including the cloned gene ZmNAC49, which responds to drought by regulating stomatal density. Enrichment and protein interaction network showed that signaling pathways responded to drought resistance, including jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and abscisic acid-activated. Additionally, several transcription factors involved in DS were identified, including basic leucine zipper (GRMZM2G370026), NAC (GRMZM2G347043), and ethylene-responsive element binding protein (GRMZM2G169654). 
Conclusions: In this study, we nominated several genes as candidate genes for drought resistance by integrating association mapping and transcription analysis. These results provide valuable information for understanding the genetic basis of drought tolerance at the mature stage and for designing drought-tolerant maize breeding."
37803314,response to heat stress,Leaf photosynthetic characteristics of waxy maize in response to different degrees of heat stress during grain filling,"Background: In the context of climate change, maize is facing unprecedented heat stress (HS) threats during grain filling. Understanding how HS affects yield is the key to reducing the impact of climate change on maize production. Suyunuo5 (SYN5) and Yunuo7 (YN7) were used as materials, and four temperature gradients of 28℃ (day)/20℃ (night; T0, control), 32 °C/24°C (T1, mild HS), 36 °C/28°C (T2, moderate HS), and 40 °C/32°C (T3, severe HS) were set up during grain filling to explore the physiological mechanism of different degrees HS affecting photosynthetic characteristics of leaves in this study. 
Results: Results showed that HS accelerated the degradation of chlorophyll, disturbed the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and caused leaf damage. Heat stress induced the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes, which results in the decrease of enzymatic activities involved in photosynthesis, thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and reducing yield. Integrated analysis showed that the degree of the negative influence of three HS types during grain filling on leaves and yield was T3 > T2 > T1. The increase in HS disturbed leaf physiological activities and grain filling. Meanwhile, this study observed that the YN7 was more heat tolerance than SYN5 and thus it was recommended to use YN7 in waxy maize planting areas with frequent high temperatures. 
Conclusions: Heat stress during grain filling caused premature senescence of the leaves by inhibiting the ability of leaves to photosynthesize and accelerating the oxidative damage of cells, thereby affecting the waxy maize yield. Our study helped to simulate the productivity of waxy maize under high temperatures and provided assistance for a stable yield of waxy maize under future climate warming."
37810381,response to Puccinia polysora,Identification of southern corn rust resistance QTNs in Chinese summer maize germplasm via multi-locus GWAS and post-GWAS analysis.,"Southern corn rust (SCR) caused by Puccinia polysora Underw is a major disease leading to severe yield losses in China Summer Corn Belt. Using six multi-locus GWAS methods, we identified a set of SCR resistance QTNs from a diversity panel of 140 inbred lines collected from China Summer Corn Belt. Thirteen QTNs on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 were grouped into three types of allele effects and their associations with SCR phenotypes were verified by post-GWAS case-control sampling, allele/haplotype effect analysis. Relative resistance (RRR) and relative susceptibility (RRs) catering to its inbred carrier were estimated from single QTN and QTN-QTN combos and epistatitic effects were estimated for QTN-QTN combos. By transcriptomic annotation, a set of candidate genes were predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation (S5_145, Zm00001d01613, transcription factor GTE4), phosphorylation (S8_123, Zm00001d010672, Pgk2- phosphoglycerate kinase 2), and temperature stress response (S6_164a/S6_164b, Zm00001d038806, hsp101, and S5_211, Zm00001d017978, cellulase25). The breeding implications of the above findings were discussed."
37812350,alpha tocopherol level,Low expression of lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3) enhances the retention of kernel tocopherols in maize during storage.,"Background: Deficiency of vitamin E results in several neurological and age-related disorders in humans. Utilization of maize mutants with favourable vte4-allele led to the development of several α-tocopherol (vitamin E) rich (16-19 µg/g) maize hybrids worldwide. However, the degradation of tocopherols during post-harvest storage substantially affects the efficacy of these genotypes. 

Methods and results: We studied the role of lipoxygenase enzyme and Lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3) gene on the degradation of tocopherols at monthly intervals under traditional storage up to six months in two vte4-based contrasting-tocopherol retention maize inbreds viz. HKI323-PVE and HKI193-1-PVE. The analysis revealed significant degradation of tocopherols across storage intervals in both the inbreds. Lower retention of α-tocopherol was noticed in HKI193-1-PVE. HKI323-PVE with the higher retention of α-tocopherol showed lower lipoxygenase activity throughout the storage intervals. LOX3 gene expression was higher (~ 1.5-fold) in HKI193-1-PVE compared to HKI323-PVE across the storage intervals. Both lipoxygenase activity and LOX3 expression peaked at 120 days after storage (DAS) in both genotypes. Further, a similar trend was observed for LOX3 expression and lipoxygenase activity. The α-tocopherol exhibited a significantly negative correlation with lipoxygenase enzyme and expression of LOX3 across the storage intervals. 

Conclusions: HKI323-PVE with high tocopherol retention, low -lipoxygenase activity, and -LOX3 gene expression can act as a potential donor in the vitamin E biofortification program. Protein-protein association network analysis also indicated the independent effect of vte4 and LOX genes. This is the first comprehensive report analyzing the expression of the LOX3 gene and deciphering its vital role in the retention of α-tocopherol in biofortified maize varieties under traditional storage."
37813193,response to cold stress; drought response,Molecular mechanisms of SNAC1 (Stress-responsive NAC1) in conferring the abiotic stress tolerance.,"NAC family gene - SNAC1 (Stress-responsive NAC1) is responsive to drought, salt, cold stress, and ABA. It acts as a regulator in mediating tolerance to abiotic stress through different pathways. Abiotic stress, among them drought and salinity, are adverse factors for plant growth and crop productivity. SNAC1 was an object of high interest according to the effect of improved drought and salt tolerance when overexpressed in different plant species such as rice, wheat, barley, cotton, maize, banana, or oat. SNAC1 functions by regulating the expression of genes that contain the NAC Recognized Sequence (NACRS) within their promoter region. This gene is induced by drought, specifically in guard cells. Its downstream targets have been identified. The role of SNAC1 in molecular and physiological responses during abiotic stress has been proposed, but this knowledge still needs to be expanded. Here, we describe recent advances in understanding the action of SNAC1 in adapting plants to abiotic stress."
37814446,drought response,Targeting of flavodoxin to chloroplasts of mesophyll but not bundle sheath maize cells confers increased drought tolerance.,"The use of tissue-specific transformation in maize has been sparse, especially for photosynthetic studies. Our results indicate that flavodoxin intervention provides better tolerance to oxidative and drought stress in maize, but only when targeted to Ms chloroplasts. These plastids perform LET, and the ability of flavodoxin to engage in this pathway as a ferredoxin analog is well-established in C3 plants (Tognetti et al., 2006). Flavodoxin accumulation in BS chloroplasts performing CET was instead inconsequential. It is possible that LET occurring in Ms plastids is the most stress-sensitive pathway of C4 photosynthesis, as proposed by Liu et al. (2022), and thus the one that benefits more from the relief offered by flavodoxin to the excess of excitation energy. While these issues certainly deserve further investigation, our report identifies the type of intervention required to improve stress tolerance in maize plants using the flavodoxin approach, thus providing a more effective rationale to engineer this most important crop for better growth and yield in suboptimal environments. Moreover, combination of tissue-specific expression with alternative electron shuttles such as flavodoxin provides a research tool to investigate the complex relationship between environmental hardships and C4 photosynthesis."
37816495,response to western corn rootworm,GWAS analysis of maize host plant resistance to western corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) reveals candidate small effect loci for resistance breeding.,"Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (LeConte) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is the most serious economic pest of maize, Zea mays (L.) (Poales: Poaceae), in the U.S. Corn Belt and also threatens production in Europe. Traditional management options have repeatedly failed over time as western corn rootworm rapidly develops resistance to insecticides, transgenic maize and even crop rotation. Traits that improve host plant resistance and tolerance are highly sought after by plant breeders for crop protection and pest management. However, maize resistance to western corn rootworm appears to be highly complex and despite over 75 yr of breeding efforts, there are no naturally resistant hybrids available commercially. Using phenotypic data from field and greenhouse experiments on a highly diverse collection of 282 inbred lines, we screened and genetically mapped western corn rootworm-related traits to identify genetic loci which may be useful for future breeding or genetic engineering efforts. Our results confirmed that western corn rootworm resistance is complex with relatively low heritability due in part to strong genotype by environment impacts and the inherent difficulties of phenotyping below ground root traits. The results of the Genome Wide Associated Study identified 29 loci that are potentially associated with resistance to western corn rootworm. Of these loci, 16 overlap with those found in previous transcription or mapping studies indicating a higher likelihood they are truly involved in maize western corn rootworm resistance. Taken together with previous studies, these results indicate that breeding for natural western corn rootworm resistance will likely require the stacking of multiple small effect loci."
37817885,stomatal conductance,Rotating Stomata Measurement Based on Anchor-Free Object Detection and Stomata Conductance Calculation.,"Stomata play an essential role in regulating water and carbon dioxide levels in plant leaves, which is important for photosynthesis. Previous deep learning-based plant stomata detection methods are based on horizontal detection. The detection anchor boxes of deep learning model are horizontal, while the angle of stomata is randomized, so it is not possible to calculate stomata traits directly from the detection anchor boxes. Additional processing of image (e.g., rotating image) is required before detecting stomata and calculating stomata traits. This paper proposes a novel approach, named DeepRSD (deep learning-based rotating stomata detection), for detecting rotating stomata and calculating stomata basic traits at the same time. Simultaneously, the stomata conductance loss function is introduced in the DeepRSD model training, which improves the efficiency of stomata detection and conductance calculation. The experimental results demonstrate that the DeepRSD model reaches 94.3% recognition accuracy for stomata of maize leaf. The proposed method can help researchers conduct large-scale studies on stomata morphology, structure, and stomata conductance models."
37828926,husk tightness,Genomic selection to improve husk tightness based on genomic molecular markers in maize.,"Introduction: The husk tightness (HTI) in maize plays a crucial role in regulating the water content of ears during the maturity stage, thereby influencing the quality of mechanical grain harvesting in China. Genomic selection (GS), which employs molecular markers, offers a promising approach for identifying and selecting inbred lines with the desired HTI trait in maize breeding. However, the effectiveness of GS is contingent upon various factors, including the genetic architecture of breeding populations, sequencing platforms, and statistical models. 

Methods: An association panel of maize inbred lines was grown across three sites over two years, divided into four subgroups. GS analysis for HTI prediction was performed using marker data from three sequencing platforms and six marker densities with six statistical methods. 

Results: The findings indicate that a loosely attached husk can aid in the dissipation of water from kernels in temperate maize germplasms across most environments but not nessarily for tropical-origin maize. Considering the balance between GS prediction accuracy and breeding cost, the optimal prediction strategy is the rrBLUP model, the 50K sequencing platform, a 30% proportion of the test population, and a marker density of r2=0.1. Additionally, selecting a specific SS subgroup for sampling the testing set significantly enhances the predictive capacity for husk tightness. 

Discussion: The determination of the optimal GS prediction strategy for HTI provides an economically feasible reference for the practice of molecular breeding. It also serves as a reference method for GS breeding of other agronomic traits."
37828934,response to Fusarium stalk rot; response to Trichoderma spp.; response to Fusarium ear rot,"Maize plant expresses SWEET transporters differently when interacting with Trichoderma asperellum and Fusarium verticillioides, two fungi with different lifestyles.","Most Trichoderma species are beneficial fungi that promote plant growth and resistance, while Fusarium genera cause several crop damages. During the plant-fungi interaction there is a competition for sugars in both lifestyles. Here we analyzed the plant growth promotion and biocontrol activity of T. asperellum against F. verticillioides and the effect of both fungi on the expression of the maize diffusional sugar transporters, the SWEETs. The biocontrol activity was done in two ways, the first was by observing the growth capacity of both fungus in a dual culture. The second one by analyzing the infection symptoms, the chlorophyl content and the transcript levels of defense genes determined by qPCR in plants with different developmental stages primed with T. asperellum conidia and challenged with F. verticillioides. In a dual culture, T. asperellum showed antagonist activity against F. verticillioides. In the primed plants a delay in the infection disease was observed, they sustained chlorophyll content even after the infection, and displayed upregulated defense-related genes. Additionally, the T. asperellum primed plants had longer stems than the nonprimed plants. SWEETs transcript levels were analyzed by qPCR in plants primed with either fungus. Both fungi affect the transcript levels of several maize sugar transporters differently. T. asperellum increases the expression of six SWEETs on leaves and two at the roots and causes a higher exudation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose at the roots. On the contrary, F. verticillioides reduces the expression of the SWEETs on the leaves, and more severely when a more aggressive strain is in the plant. Our results suggest that the plant is able to recognize the lifestyle of the fungi and respond accordingly by changing the expression of several genes, including the SWEETs, to establish a new sugar flux."
37831626,root development,A role for fermentation in aerobic conditions as revealed by computational analysis of maize root metabolism during growth by cell elongation.,"The root is a well-studied example of cell specialisation, yet little is known about the metabolism that supports the transport functions and growth of different root cell types. To address this, we used computational modelling to study metabolism in the elongation zone of a maize lateral root. A functional-structural model captured the cell-anatomical features of the root and modelled how they changed as the root elongated. From these data, we derived constraints for a flux balance analysis model that predicted metabolic fluxes of the 11 concentric rings of cells in the root. We discovered a distinct metabolic flux pattern in the cortical cell rings, endodermis and pericycle (but absent in the epidermis) that involved a high rate of glycolysis and production of the fermentation end-products lactate and ethanol. This aerobic fermentation was confirmed experimentally by metabolite analysis. The use of fermentation in the model was not obligatory but was the most efficient way to meet the specific demands for energy, reducing power and carbon skeletons of expanding cells. Cytosolic acidification was avoided in the fermentative mode due to the substantial consumption of protons by lipid synthesis. These results expand our understanding of fermentative metabolism beyond that of hypoxic niches and suggest that fermentation could play an important role in the metabolism of aerobic tissues."
37834187,response to Ustilago maydis,The Resistance of Maize to Ustilago maydis Infection Is Correlated with the Degree of Methyl Esterification of Pectin in the Cell Wall.,"Common smut caused by Ustilago maydis is one of the dominant fungal diseases in plants. The resistance mechanism to U. maydis infection involving alterations in the cell wall is poorly studied. In this study, the resistant single segment substitution line (SSSL) R445 and its susceptible recurrent parent line Ye478 of maize were infected with U. maydis, and the changes in cell wall components and structure were studied at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 days postinfection. In R445 and Ye478, the contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin increased by varying degrees, and pectin methylesterase (PME) activity increased. The changes in hemicellulose and pectin in the cell wall after U. maydis infection were analyzed via immunolabeling using monoclonal antibodies against hemicellulsic xylans and high/low-methylated pectin. U. maydis infection altered methyl esterification of pectin, and the degree of methyl esterification was correlated with the resistance of maize to U. maydis. Furthermore, the relationship between methyl esterification of pectin and host resistance was validated using 15 maize inbred lines with different resistance levels. The results revealed that cell wall components, particularly pectin, were important factors affecting the colonization and propagation of U. maydis in maize, and methyl esterification of pectin played a role in the resistance of maize to U. maydis infection."
37837470,potassium content,Dynamic transcriptome analysis unravels key regulatory genes of maize root growth and development in response to potassium deficiency.,"Integrated root phenotypes and transcriptome analysis have revealed key candidate genes responsible for maize root growth and development in potassium deficiency. Potassium (K) is a vital macronutrient for plant growth, but our understanding of its regulatory mechanisms in maize root system architecture (RSA) and K+ uptake remains limited. To address this, we conducted hydroponic and field trials at different growth stages. K+ deficiency significantly inhibited maize root growth, with metrics like total root length, primary root length, width and maximum root number reduced by 50% to 80% during early seedling stages. In the field, RSA traits exhibited maximum values at the silking stage but continued to decline thereafter. Furthermore, K deprivation had a pronounced negative impact on root morphology and RSA growth and grain yield. RNA-Seq analysis identified 5972 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 17 associated with K+ signaling, transcription factors, and transporters. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed 23 co-expressed modules, with enrichment of transcription factors at different developmental stages under K deficiency. Several DEGs and transcription factors were predicted as potential candidate genes responsible for maize root growth and development. Interestingly, some of these genes exhibited homology to well-known regulators of root architecture or development in Arabidopsis, such as Zm00001d014467 (AtRCI3), Zm00001d011237 (AtWRKY9), and Zm00001d030862 (AtAP2/ERF). Identifying these key genes helps to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing maize root growth and development under nutrient deficient conditions offering potential benefits for enhancing maize production and improving stress resistance through targeted manipulation of RSA traits in modern breeding efforts. 
Main conclusion: Integrated root phenotypes and transcriptome analysis have revealed key candidate genes responsible for maize root growth and development in potassium deficiency."
37838155,root morphology,Maize (Zea mays L.) root exudation profiles change in quality and quantity during plant development - a field study.,"Deciphering root exudate composition of soil-grown plants is considered a crucial step to better understand plant-soil-microbe interactions affecting plant growth performance. In this study, two genotypes of Zea mays L. (WT, rth3) differing in root hair elongation were grown in the field in two substrates (sand, loam) in custom-made, perforated columns inserted into the field plots. Root exudates were collected at different plant developmental stages (BBCH 14, 19, 59, 83) using a soil-hydroponic-hybrid exudation sampling approach. Exudates were characterized by LC-MS based non-targeted metabolomics, as well as by spectrophotometric assays targeting total dissolved organic carbon, soluble carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, and phenolics. Results showed that plant developmental stage was the main driver for the composition and quantity of exuded compounds. Carbon (C) exudation per plant increased with increasing biomass production over time, while C exudation rates per cm² root surface area h-1 decreased with plant maturity. Furthermore, exudation rates were higher in the substrate with lower nutrient mobility (i.e., loam). Surprisingly, we observed higher exudation rates in root hairless rth3 compared to the root hair-forming WT sibling, though exudate metabolite composition remained similar. Our results highlight the impact of plant developmental stage on the plant-soil-microbe interplay. 
Highlights: 
    •    Root exudation profiling of field-grown maize plants across plant development 
    •    Plant developmental stage was main driver of changes in exudate the quality and quantity 
    •    Absence of root hairs enhanced exudation rate and caused changes in root morphology 
    •    Exudation was influenced by the substrate sorption capacity and nutrient mobility"
37839393,response to heavy metals,The bundle sheath in Zea mays leaves functions as a protective barrier against the toxic effect of lead.,"Lead is a highly toxic metal. It impairs the metabolism of living organisms. Plants show different sensitivity to the action of this element. One of the plants with relatively high lead tolerance is Zea mays, where even in detached leaves treated with Pb2+ ions, the photosynthesis rate remains very high compared to other plant species. This study set out to determine the mechanism responsible for the high resistance of maize photosynthetic tissue to the toxic effect of this metal. For this purpose, the cut leaves of Z. mays were incubated in Pb(NO3)2 solutions at different concentrations. Regions of lead accumulation in tissues and cells were located using histochemical methods and transmission electron microscopy. The experiments showed a diverse distribution of lead ions in the leaf blade of Z. mays. Most of the accumulated Pb2+ ions were observed in the vascular bundle and the bundle sheath, while minimal traces of metal were transferred to the mesophyll. In Pisum sativum leaves, although Pb(NO3)2 concentration in the solution was two-fold lower, lead accumulated in all the leaf tissues - mainly in the vascular bundle, epidermis, sclerenchyma, and mesophyll. Thus, bundle sheath cells in maize leaves were able to inhibit the flow of Pb2+ ions to the ground tissue. Therefore, the influence of the toxic metal on photosynthesis in mesophyll cells remained minimal. These experiments show that the structure of Z. mays leaf, with a layer of bundle sheath cells (characteristic of C4 plants), contributes to the protecting photosynthetic tissue against the toxic effect of lead."
37850886,drought response,Maize GOLDEN2-LIKE proteins enhance drought tolerance in rice by promoting stomatal closure.,"Drought has become one of the most severe abiotic stresses experienced in agricultural production across the world. Plants respond to water deficit via stomatal movements in the leaves, which are mainly regulated by abscisic acid (ABA). A previous study from our lab showed that constitutive expression of maize (Zea mays L.) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.) can improve stomatal conductance and plant photosynthetic capacity under field conditions. In the present study, we uncovered a function of ZmGLKs regulation of stomatal movement in rice during drought stress. We found that elevated drought tolerance in rice plants overexpressing ZmGLK1 or GOLDEN2 (ZmG2) was conferred by rapid ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Comparative analysis of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the rice leaves and DNA-affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) results obtained in vitro revealed that ZmGLKs played roles in regulating ABA-related and stress-responsive pathways. Four up-regulated genes closely functioning in abiotic stress tolerance with strong binding peaks in the DAP-seq data were identified as putative target genes of ZmGLK1 and ZmG2 in rice. These results demonstrated that maize GLKs play an important role in regulating stomatal movements to coordinate photosynthesis and stress tolerance. This trait is a valuable target for breeding drought-tolerant crop plants without compromising photosynthetic capacity."
37851276,mycorrhizal infection,Mycorrhizal status and host genotype interact to shape plant nutrition in field grown maize (Zea mays ssp. mays).,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish symbioses with the major cereal crops, providing plants with increased access to nutrients while enhancing their tolerance to toxic heavy metals. However, not all plant varieties benefit equally from this association. In this study, we used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to evaluate the combined effect of host genotypic variation (G) and AMF across 141 genotypes on the concentration of 20 mineral elements in the leaves and grain of field grown maize (Zea mays spp. mays). Our mapping design included selective incorporation of a castor AMF-incompatibility mutation, allowing estimation of AMF, QTL and QTLxAMF effects by comparison of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Overall, AMF compatibility was associated with higher concentrations of boron (B), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), phosphorus (P), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) and lower concentrations of arsenic (As), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), potassium (K) and strontium (Sr). In addition to effects on individual elements, pairwise correlation matrices for element concentration differed between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. We mapped 22 element QTLs, including 18 associated with QTLxAMF effects that indicate plant genotype-specific differences in the impact of AMF on the host ionome. Although there is considerable interest in AMF as biofertilizers, it remains challenging to estimate the impact of AMF in the field. Our design illustrates an effective approach for field evaluation of AMF effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capacity of the ionome to reveal host genotype-specific variation in the impact of AMF on plant nutrition."
37855950,water use efficiency,Plasticity QTLs specifically contribute to the genotype × water availability interaction in maize.,"Multi-trial genome wide association study of plasticity indices allow to detect QTLs specifically involved in the genotype x water availability interaction. Concerns regarding high maize yield losses due to increasing occurrences of drought events are growing, and breeders are still looking for molecular markers for drought tolerance. However, the genetic determinism of traits in response to drought is highly complex and identification of causal regions is a tremendous task. Here, we exploit the phenotypic data obtained from four trials carried out on a phenotyping platform, where a diversity panel of 254 maize hybrids was grown under well-watered and water deficit conditions, to investigate the genetic bases of the drought response in maize. To dissociate drought effect from other environmental factors, we performed multi-trial genome-wide association study on well-watered and water deficit phenotypic means, and on phenotypic plasticity indices computed from measurements made for six ecophysiological traits. We identify 102 QTLs and 40 plasticity QTLs. Most of them were new compared to those obtained from a previous study on the same dataset. Our results show that plasticity QTLs cover genetic regions not identified by QTLs. Furthermore, for all ecophysiological traits, except one, plasticity QTLs are specifically involved in the genotype by water availability interaction, for which they explain between 60 and 100% of the variance. Altogether, QTLs and plasticity QTLs captured more than 75% of the genotype by water availability interaction variance, and allowed to find new genetic regions. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering phenotypic plasticity to decipher the genetic architecture of trait response to stress. 
Key message: Multi-trial genome wide association study of plasticity indices allow to detect QTLs specifically involved in the genotype x water availability interaction."
37858961,tassel branch number,ZmELF3.1 integrates the RA2-TSH4 module to repress maize tassel branching.,"Tassel branch number (TBN) is a key agronomic trait for adapting to high-density planting and grain yield in maize. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying tassel branching are still largely unknown. Here, we used molecular and genetic studies together to show that ZmELF3.1 plays a critical role in regulating TBN in maize. Previous studies showed that ZmELF3.1 forms the evening complex through interacting with ZmELF4 and ZmLUX to regulate flowering in maize and that RA2 and TSH4 (ZmSBP2) suppresses and promotes TBN in maize, respectively. In this study, we show that loss-of-function mutants of ZmELF3.1 exhibit a significant increase of TBN. We also show that RA2 directly binds to the promoter of TSH4 and represses its expression, thus leading to reduced TBN. We further demonstrate that ZmELF3.1 directly interacts with both RA2 and ZmELF4.2 to form tri-protein complexes that further enhance the binding of RA2 to the promoter of TSH4, leading to suppressed TSH4 expression and consequently decreased TBN. Our combined results establish a novel functional link between the ELF3-ELF4-RA2 complex and miR156-SPL regulatory module in regulating tassel branching and provide a valuable target for genetic improvement of tassel branching in maize."
37860246,haploid production,Genetic basis of maize maternal haploid induction beyond MATRILINEAL and ZmDMP.,"In maize, doubled haploid (DH) lines are created in vivo through crosses with maternal haploid inducers. Their induction ability, usually expressed as haploid induction rate (HIR), is known to be under polygenic control. Although two major genes (MTL and ZmDMP) affecting this trait were recently described, many others remain unknown. To identify them, we designed and performed a SNP based (~9007) genome-wide association study using a large and diverse panel of 159 maternal haploid inducers. Our analyses identified a major gene near MTL, which is present in all inducers and necessary to disrupt haploid induction. We also found a significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 10 using a case-control mapping approach, in which 793 noninducers were used as controls. This QTL harbors a kokopelli ortholog, whose role in maternal haploid induction was recently described in Arabidopsis. QTL with smaller effects were identified on six of the ten maize chromosomes, confirming the polygenic nature of this trait. These QTL could be incorporated into inducer breeding programs through marker-assisted selection approaches. Further improving HIR is important to reduce the cost of DH line production."
37860252,assimilate partitioning; drought response,Securing maize reproductive success under drought stress by harnessing CO2 fertilization for greater productivity.,"Securing maize grain yield is crucial to meet food and energy needs for the future growing population, especially under frequent drought events and elevated CO2 (eCO2) due to climate change. To maximize the kernel setting rate under drought stress is a key strategy in battling against the negative impacts. Firstly, we summarize the major limitations to leaf source and kernel sink in maize under drought stress, and identified that loss in grain yield is mainly attributed to reduced kernel set. Reproductive drought tolerance can be realized by collective contribution with a greater assimilate import into ear, more available sugars for ovary and silk use, and higher capacity to remobilize assimilate reserve. As such, utilization of CO2 fertilization by improved photosynthesis and greater reserve remobilization is a key strategy for coping with drought stress under climate change condition. We propose that optimizing planting methods and mining natural genetic variation still need to be done continuously, meanwhile, by virtue of advanced genetic engineering and plant phenomics tools, the breeding program of higher photosynthetic efficiency maize varieties adapted to eCO2 can be accelerated. Consequently, stabilizing maize production under drought stress can be achieved by securing reproductive success by harnessing CO2 fertilization."
37868313,response to Exserohilum turcicum,Inhibition of ethylene involved in resistance to E. turcicum in an exotic-derived double haploid maize population.,"Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is an economically important disease of maize. While the genetic architecture of NCLB has been well characterized, the pathogen is known to overcome currently deployed resistance genes, and the role of hormones in resistance to NCLB is an area of active research. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify significant markers associated with resistance to NCLB, (ii) to identify metabolic pathways associated with NCLB resistance, and (iii) to examine role of ethylene in resistance to NCLB. We screened 252 lines from the exotic-derived double haploid BGEM maize population for resistance to NCLB in both field and greenhouse environments. We used a genome wide association study (GWAS) and stepwise regression to identify four markers associated with resistance, followed by a pathway association study tool (PAST) to identify important metabolic pathways associated with disease severity and incubation period. The ethylene synthesis pathway was significant for disease severity and incubation period. We conducted a greenhouse assay in which we inhibited ethylene to examine the role of ethylene in resistance to NCLB. We observed a significant increase in incubation period and a significant decrease in disease severity between plants treated with the ethylene inhibitor and mock-treated plants. Our study confirms the potential of the BGEM population as a source of novel alleles for resistance. We also confirm the role of ethylene in resistance to NCLB and contribute to the growing body of literature on ethylene and disease resistance in monocots."
37872143,response to Ustilago maydis,A transcriptional activator effector of Ustilago maydis regulates hyperplasia in maize during pathogen-induced tumor formation,"Ustilago maydis causes common smut in maize, which is characterized by tumor formation in aerial parts of maize. Tumors result from the de novo cell division of highly developed bundle sheath and subsequent cell enlargement. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. Here, we characterize the U. maydis effector Sts2 (Small tumor on seedlings 2), which promotes the division of hyperplasia tumor cells. Upon infection, Sts2 is translocated into the maize cell nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional activator, and the transactivation activity is crucial for its virulence function. Sts2 interacts with ZmNECAP1, a yet undescribed plant transcriptional activator, and it activates the expression of several leaf developmental regulators to potentiate tumor formation. On the contrary, fusion of a suppressive SRDX-motif to Sts2 causes dominant negative inhibition of tumor formation, underpinning the central role of Sts2 for tumorigenesis. Our results not only disclose the virulence mechanism of a tumorigenic effector, but also reveal the essential role of leaf developmental regulators in pathogen-induced tumor formation."
37877090,nitrogen use efficiency,Phenotypic and genome-wide association analyses for nitrogen use efficiency related traits in maize (Zea mays L.) exotic introgression lines.,"Nitrogen (N) limits crop production, yet more than half of N fertilizer inputs are lost to the environment. Developing maize hybrids with improved N use efficiency can help minimize N losses and in turn reduce adverse ecological, economical, and health consequences. This study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with agronomic traits (plant height, grain yield, and anthesis to silking interval) under high and low N conditions. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 181 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from crosses between landraces from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (BGEM lines) project and two inbreds, PHB47 and PHZ51. These DH lines were genotyped using 62,077 SNP markers. The same lines from the per se trials were used as parental lines for the testcross field trials. Plant height, anthesis to silking interval, and grain yield were collected from high and low N conditions in three environments for both per se and testcross trials. We used three GWAS models, namely, general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), and Fixed and Random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU) model. We observed significant genetic variation among the DH lines and their derived testcrosses. Interestingly, some testcrosses of exotic introgression lines were superior under high and low N conditions compared to the check hybrid, PHB47/PHZ51. We detected multiple SNPs associated with agronomic traits under high and low N, some of which co-localized with gene models associated with stress response and N metabolism. The BGEM panel is, thus, a promising source of allelic diversity for genes controlling agronomic traits under different N conditions."
37889164,response to Exserohilum turcicum,Photosynthetic costs and impact on epidemiological parameters associated with Ht resistance genes in maize lines infected with Exserohilum turcicum.,"Northern corn leaf blight is caused by Exserohilum turcicum, mainly controlled by the use of resistant cultivars. Maize lines carrying individual resistance genes B37Ht1, B37Ht2, B37Ht3 and B37Htn1 express different defense symptoms having impact on the photosynthetic activity, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and on epidemiological parameters. Plants were inoculated with a race 0 isolate of E. turcicum conferring a compatible interaction with B37 and incompatible interactions with plants carrying resistance genes. Five days post inoculation (dpi), the resistant lines displayed reduction in leaf CO2 assimilation (A) of 30 to 80% compared to healthy plants. At 14 dpi, inoculated plants of B37Ht1 showed a significant decrease in A, similar to B37 (up to 94%). The instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (k) was significantly reduced on inoculated plants of the lines B37Ht2, B37Ht3, and B37Htn1 (54 - 81%) at 5 dpi. Curiously, the reduction in k for B37 and B37Ht1 (up to 95%) was higher at 14 dpi then at 5 dpi (up to 81%). At 6 dpi, low levels of H2O2 were detected in B37Ht1, in contrast to B37Htn1, where a high H2O2 level and peroxidase activity were observed. Sporulation rate on B37Ht1, B37Ht3 and B37Htn1 decreased by 92% compared to the susceptible control, while strong sporulation occurred in lesions on line B37Ht2. The resistance in maize to E. turcicum conferred by Ht resistance genes is associated with photosynthetic costs and may have quite contrasting effects on host physiology and major epidemiological parameters, like sporulation, which contributes inoculum for secondary infections."
37900110,root development,A Plate Growth Assay to Quantify Embryonic Root Development of Zea mays.,"Murashige-Skoog medium solutions have been used in a variety of plant plate growth assays, yet most research uses Arabidopsis thaliana as the study organism. For larger seeds such as maize (Zea mays), most protocols employ a paper towel roll method for experiments, which often involves wrapping maize seedlings in wet, sterile germination paper. What the paper towel roll method lacks, however, is the ability to image the roots over time without risk of contamination. Here, we describe a sterile plate growth assay that contains Murashige-Skoog medium to grow seedlings starting two days after germination. This protocol uses a section of a paper towel roll method to achieve uniform germination of maize seedlings, which are sterilely transferred onto large acrylic plates for the duration of the experiment. The media can undergo modification to include an assortment of plant hormones, exogenous sugars, and other chemicals. The acrylic plates allow researchers to freely image the plate without disturbing the seedlings and control the environment in which the seedlings are grown, such as modifications in temperature and light. Additionally, the protocol is widely adaptable for use with other cereal crops. Key features • Builds upon plate growth methods routinely used for Arabidopsis seedlings but that are inadequate for maize. • Real-time photographic analysis of seedlings up to two weeks following germination. • Allows for testing of various growth conditions involving an assortment of additives and/or modification of environmental conditions. • Samples are able to be collected for genotype screening."
37920843,Abiotic stress response,Exploring the roles of ZmARM gene family in maize development and abiotic stress response.,"Armadillo (ARM) was a gene family important to plants, with crucial roles in regulating plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, the properties and functions of ARM family members in maize had received limited attention. Therefore, this study employed bioinformatics methods to analyze the structure and evolution of ARM-repeat protein family members in maize. The maize (Zea mays L.) genome contains 56 ARM genes distributed over 10 chromosomes, and collinearity analysis indicated 12 pairs of linkage between them. Analysis of the physicochemical properties of ARM proteins showed that most of these proteins were acidic and hydrophilic. According to the number and evolutionary analysis of the ARM genes, the ARM genes in maize can be divided into eight subgroups, and the gene structure and conserved motifs showed similar compositions in each group. The findings shed light on the significant roles of 56 ZmARM domain genes in development and abiotic stress, particularly drought stress. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that drought stress exerts an influence on specific members of the ZmARM family, such as ZmARM4, ZmARM12, ZmARM34 and ZmARM36. The comprehensive profiling of these genes in the whole genome, combined with expression analysis, establishes a foundation for further exploration of plant gene function in the context of abiotic stress and reproductive development."
37934825,stalk lodging,Cryptochrome 1b represses gibberellin signaling to enhance lodging resistance in maize,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Photoperiod, light quality, and light intensity in the environment can affect the growth, development, yield, and quality of maize. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), cryptochromes are blue-light receptors that mediate the photocontrol of stem elongation, leaf expansion, shade tolerance, and photoperiodic flowering. However, the function of maize cryptochrome ZmCRY in maize architecture and photomorphogenic development remains largely elusive. The ZmCRY1b transgene product can activate the light signaling pathway in Arabidopsis and complement the etiolation phenotype of the cry1-304 mutant. Our findings show that the loss-of-function mutant of ZmCRY1b in maize exhibits more etiolation phenotypes under low blue light and appears slender in the field compared with wild-type plants. Under blue and white light, overexpression of ZmCRY1b in maize substantially inhibits seedling etiolation and shade response by enhancing protein accumulation of the bZIP transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (ZmHY5) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5-LIKE (ZmHY5L), which directly upregulate the expression of genes encoding gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidase to deactivate GA and repress plant height. More interestingly, ZmCRY1b enhances lodging resistance by reducing plant and ear heights and promoting root growth in both inbred lines and hybrids. In conclusion, ZmCRY1b contributes blue-light signaling upon seedling de-etiolation and integrates light signals with the GA metabolic pathway in maize, resulting in lodging resistance and providing information for improving maize varieties."
37937624,phosphorus uptake,Diversity of nitrogen-fixing and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria associated with the rhizosphere of Andean maize in Ecuador.,"A great diversity of microorganisms in the soil plays an important role in the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Among these microorganisms are bacteria that have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen or mineralize phosphorus, thus making it easily assimilable for plants. Maize is the main crop in the highlands of Ecuador (above 2000 meters) and it is predominantly traditional, using native seeds and very little or no agrochemicals. The National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIAP) has a collection of bacteria collected from the rhizosphere of maize in the highlands of Ecuador that has not been taxonomically identified. This research aimed to carry out a biochemical and genetic characterization to establish the identity of the collected nitrogen-fixing and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria and to understand better the diversity of microorganisms present in the root biome of Andean maize. The hypothesis consisted of determining if there is a difference in the bacteria associated with the rhizosphere of maize in the Andean region of Ecuador compared with other regions. The bacteria underwent classical biochemical characterization based on catalase, oxidase, urease, sulfates, indole, sulfate-indole motility (SIM), and lactose, among others, and genetic identification by 16S rDNA ribosomal gene sequencing, PCR, and SANGER sequencing. A great diversity of microorganisms associated with the rhizosphere of the crop was found, including the genera Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, Brevundimonas, Pseudomonas, and Pseudoxanthomonas. INIAP conserves these bacteria in a bank of microorganisms associated with crops of economic importance. They are useful for the development of biofertilizers that could contribute to a more sustainable agriculture in the region."
37938583,response to aluminum,Transcriptome-based strategies for identifying aluminum tolerance genes in popcorn (Zea mays L. var. everta).,"Aluminum (Al) toxicity limits crop production worldwide. Although studies have identified genes associated with Al tolerance in crops, a large amount of data remains unexplored using other strategies. Here, we searched for single substitutions and InDels across differentially expressed genes (DEGs), linked DEGs to Al-tolerance QTLs reported in the literature for common maize, and investigated the alternative splicing regulated by Al3+ toxicity. We found 929 substitutions between DEGs in Al-tolerant and 464 in Al-sensitive inbred lines, of which 165 and 80 were non-synonymous, respectively. Only 12 NS variants had deleterious predicted effect on protein function in Al-tolerant and 13 in Al-sensitive. Moreover, 378 DEGs were mapped in Al-QTL regions for the Al-tolerant and 213 for the Al-sensitive. Furthermore, Al stress is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level in popcorn. Important genes identified, such as HDT1, SWEET4a, GSTs, SAD9, PIP2-2, CASP-like 5, and AGP, may benefit molecular assisted popcorn breeding or be useful in biotechnological approaches. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms of Al tolerance in popcorn and provide a 'hypothesis-free' strategy for identifying and prioritizing candidate genes that could be used to develop molecular markers or cultivars resilient to acidic soils."
37955399,photosynthetic efficiency,"A carbonic anhydrase, ZmCA4, contributes to photosynthetic efficiency, and modulates CO2 signaling gene expression by interacting with aquaporin ZmPIP2;6 in maize","Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the reversible CO2 hydration reaction that produces bicarbonate for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). This is the initial step for transmitting the CO2 signal in C4 photosynthesis. However, it remains unknown whether the maize (Zea mays L.) carbonic anhydrase gene, ZmCA4, plays a role in maize photosynthesis process. In our study, we found that ZmCA4 was relatively highly expressed in leaves and localized at chloroplast and plasma membrane of mesophyll protoplasts. Knockout of ZmCA4 reduced CA activity, while overexpression of ZmCA4 increased rubisco activity, as well as the quantum yield and relative electron transport rate in photosystem II. Overexpression of ZmCA4 enhanced maize yield-related traits. Moreover, ZmCA4 interacted with aquaporin ZmPIP2;6 in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The double-knockout mutant for ZmPIP2;6 and ZmCA4 genes showed reductions in its growth, CA and PEPC activities, assimilation rate, and photosystem activity. The RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the expression of other ZmCAs, ZmPIPs, as well as CO2 signaling pathway homologous genes, and photosynthetic-related genes were all altered in the double-knockout mutant compared with the wild type. Altogether, our study’s findings point to a critical role of ZmCA4 in determining photosynthetic capacity, and modulating CO2 signaling regulation via its interaction with ZmPIP2;6, thus providing insight into the potential genetic value of ZmCA4 for maize yield improvement."
37956067,kernel development,DEFECTIVE KERNEL 56 functions in mitochondrial RNA editing and maize seed development.,"Proper seed development is essential for achieving grain production, successful seed germination, and seedling establishment in maize (Zea mays). In the past few decades, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been proven to play an essential role in regulating the development of maize kernels through post-transcriptional RNA modification of mitochondrial genes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized a mutant of DEFECTIVE KERNEL 56 (DEK56) with defective kernels that exhibited arrested development of both the embryo and endosperm. Accordingly, we isolated DEK56 through a map-based cloning strategy, and found that it encoded an E-subgroup PPR protein located in the mitochondria. Dysfunction of DEK56 resulted in altered cytidine (C) -to- uridine (U) editing efficiency at 48 editing sites across 21 mitochondrial transcripts. Notably, the editing efficiency of the maturase-related (matR) -1124 site was substantially reduced or abolished in the dek56 mutant. Furthermore, we found that the splicing efficiency of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4) introns 1 and 3 was substantially reduced in dek56 kernels, which might be a consequence of the defective MatR function. Through a protein-protein interaction test, we hypothesized that DEK56 carries out its function by recruiting the PPR-DYW protein PPR motif, coiled-coil, and DYW domain-containing protein 1 (PCW1). This interaction is facilitated by Multiple Organellar RNA Editing Factors (ZmMORFs) and Glutamine-Rich Protein 23 (ZmGRP23). Based on these findings, we developed a working model of PPR-mediated mitochondrial processing that plays an essential role in the development of maize kernels. The present study will further broaden our understanding of PPR-mediated seed development and provide a theoretical basis for maize improvement."
37966579,inflorescence development,Factors specifying sex determination in maize.,"Plant architecture is an important feature for agronomic performance in crops. In maize, which is a monoecious plant, separation of floral organs to produce specific gametes has been studied from different perspectives including genetic, biochemical and physiological. Maize mutants affected in floral organ development have been key to identifying genes, hormones and other factors like miRNAs important for sex determination. In this review, we describe floral organ formation in maize, representative mutants and genes identified with a function in establishing sexual identity either classified as feminizing or masculinizing, and its relationship with hormones associated with sexual organ identity as jasmonic acid, brassinosteroid and gibberellin. Finally, we discuss the challenges and scopes of future research in maize sex determination."
37967146,nitrogen use efficiency,Mining genic resources regulating nitrogen-use efficiency based on integrative biological analyses and their breeding applications in maize and other crops.,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential factor for limiting crop yields, and cultivation of crops with low nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) exhibits increasing environmental and ecological risks. Hence, it is crucial to mine valuable NUE improvement genes, which is very important to develop and breed new crop varieties with high NUE in sustainable agriculture system. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis are the most common methods for dissecting genetic variations underlying complex traits. In addition, with the advancement of biotechnology, multi-omics technologies can be used to accelerate the process of exploring genetic variations. In this study, we integrate the substantial data of QTLs, quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) from GWAS, and multi-omics data including transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome and further analyze their interactions to predict some NUE-related candidate genes. We also provide the genic resources for NUE improvement among maize, rice, wheat, and sorghum by homologous alignment and collinearity analysis. Furthermore, we propose to utilize the knowledge gained from classical cases to provide the frameworks for improving NUE and breeding N-efficient varieties through integrated genomics, systems biology, and modern breeding technologies."
37971599,drought response,Molecular mechanism analysis of ZmRL6 positively regulating drought stress tolerance in maize,"MYB-related genes, a subclass of MYB transcription factor family, have been documented to play important roles in biological processes such as secondary metabolism and stress responses that affect plant growth and development. However, the regulatory roles of MYB-related genes in drought stress response remain unclear in maize. In this study, we discovered that a 1R-MYB gene, ZmRL6, encodes a 96-amino acid protein and is highly drought-inducible. We also found that it is conserved in both barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Aegilops tauschii. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of ZmRL6 can enhance drought tolerance while knock-out of ZmRL6 by CRISPR-Cas9 results in drought hypersensitivity. DAP-seq analyses additionally revealed the ZmRL6 target genes mainly contain ACCGTT, TTACCAAAC and AGCCCGAG motifs in their promoters. By combining RNA-seq and DAP-seq results together, we subsequently identified eight novel target genes of ZmRL6 that are involved in maize's hormone signal transduction, sugar metabolism, lignin synthesis, and redox signaling/oxidative stress. Collectively, our data provided insights into the roles of ZmRL6 in maize’s drought response."
37975264,cuticular lipids,Trade-offs between the accumulation of cuticular wax and jasmonic acid-mediated herbivory resistance in maize.,"Plants have evolved complex physical and chemical defense systems that allow them to withstand herbivory infestation. Composed of a complex mixture of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, cuticular wax constitutes the first physical line of defense against herbivores. Here, we report the function of Glossy 8 (ZmGL8), which encodes a 3-ketoacyl reductase belonging to the fatty acid elongase complex, in orchestrating wax production and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defenses against herbivores in maize (Zea mays). The mutation of GL8 enhanced chemical defenses by activating the JA-dependent pathway. We observed a trade-off between wax accumulation and JA levels across maize glossy mutants and 24 globally collected maize inbred lines. In addition, we demonstrated that mutants defective in cuticular wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize exhibit enhanced chemical defenses. Comprehensive transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses indicated that the gl8 mutant confers chemical resistance to herbivores by remodeling VLCFA-related lipid metabolism and subsequent JA biosynthesis and signaling. These results suggest that VLCFA-related lipid metabolism has a critical role in regulating the trade-offs between cuticular wax and JA-mediated chemical defenses."
37986260,response to nicosulfuron; herbicide response; response to tolpyralate,First report of severe tolpyralate sensitivity in corn (Zea mays) discovers a novel genetic factor conferring crop response to an herbicide.,"Background: Tolpyralate is a relatively new inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), is registered for postemergence use in all types of corn (Zea mays L.) and has a record of excellent crop tolerance. A report of severe crop injury to sweet corn inbred (XSEN187) led to the following objectives: 1) determine if sensitivity to tolpyralate in XSEN187 exists, and if confirmed, 2) determine the genetic basis of tolpyralate sensitivity, and 3) screen other corn germplasm for sensitivity to tolpyralate. 

Results: Inbred XSEN187 was confirmed sensitive to tolpyralate. Inclusion of methylated seed oil or nonionic surfactant in the spray volume was necessary for severe crop injury. Tolpyralate sensitivity in XSEN187 is not conferred by alleles at Nsf1, a cytochrome P450-encoding gene (CYP81A9) conferring tolerance to many corn herbicides. Evidence suggests tolpyralate sensitivity in XSEN187 is conferred by a single gene mapped to the Chr05: 283,240 - 1,222,909 bp interval. Moreover, tolpyralate sensitivity was observed in 48 other sweet corn and field corn inbreds. 

Conclusions: Severe sensitivity to tolpyralate exists in sweet corn and field corn germplasm when the herbicide is applied according to label directions. While corn response to several other herbicides, including HPPD-inhibitors, is conferred by the Nsf1 locus, corn sensitivity to tolpyralate is the result of a different locus. The use of tolpyralate should consider herbicide tolerance in inbred lines from which corn hybrids were derived, while alleles that render corn germplasm sensitive to tolpyralate should be eliminated from breeding populations, inbreds, and commercial cultivars."
37993774,response to gibberellin,DNA methylation and lipid metabolism are involved in GA-induced maize aleurone layers PCD as revealed by transcriptome analysis.,"Background: The aleurone layer is a part of many plant seeds, and during seed germination, aleurone cells undergo PCD, which is promoted by GA from the embryo. However, the numerous components of the GA signaling pathway that mediate PCD of the aleurone layers remain to be identified. Few genes and transcriptomes have been studied thus far in aleurone layers to improve our understanding of how PCD occurs and how the regulatory mechanism functions during PCD. Our previous studies have shown that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are required in GA-induced PCD of aleurone layer. To further explore the molecular mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications regulate aleurone PCD, we performed a global comparative transcriptome analysis of embryoless aleurones treated with GA or histone acetylase (HAT) inhibitors. 

Results: In this study, a total of 7,919 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed, 2,554 DEGs of which were found to be common under two treatments. These identified DEGs were involved in various biological processes, including DNA methylation, lipid metabolism and ROS signaling. Further investigations revealed that inhibition of DNA methyltransferases prevented aleurone PCD, suggesting that active DNA methylation plays a role in regulating aleurone PCD. GA or HAT inhibitor induced lipoxygenase gene expression, leading to lipid degradation, but this process was not affected by DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation inhibitor could regulate ROS-related gene expression and inhibit GA-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). 

Conclusion: Overall, linking of lipoxygenase, DNA methylation, and H2O2 may indicate that GA-induced higher HDAC activity in aleurones causes breakdown of lipids via regulating lipoxygenase gene expression, and increased DNA methylation positively mediates H2O2 production; thus, DNA methylation and lipid metabolism pathways may represent an important and complex signaling network in maize aleurone PCD."
38003347,Abiotic stress response,Membrane-Bound Transcription Factor ZmNAC074 Positively Regulates Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most widely cultivated crops for humans, making a vital contribution to human nutrition and health. However, in recent years, due to the influence of external adverse environments, the yield and quality of maize have been seriously affected. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) are important plant-unique TFs, which are crucial for regulating the abiotic stress response of plants. Therefore, it is of great biological significance to explore the underlying regulatory function of plant NAC TFs under various abiotic stresses. In this study, wild-type and ZmNAC074-overexpressed transgenic Arabidopsis were used as experimental materials to dissect the stress-resistant function of ZmNAC074 in transgenic Arabidopsis at phenotypic, physiological and molecular levels. The analyses of seed germination rate, survival rate, phenotype, the content of chlorophyll, carotenoids, malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and other physiological indexes induced by distinct abiotic stress conditions showed that overexpression of ZmNAC074 could confer the enhanced resistance of salt, drought, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating that ZmNAC074 plays an important regulatory role in plant response to abiotic stress, which provides an important theoretical foundation for further uncovering the molecular regulation mechanism of ZmNAC074 under abiotic stresses."
38005700,germination index,Application of Methionine Increases the Germination Rate of Maize Seeds by Triggering Multiple Phenylpropanoid Biosynthetic Genes at Transcript Levels.,"Methionine is an essential amino acid that initiates protein synthesis and serves as a substrate for various chemical reactions. Methionine metabolism plays an important role in Arabidopsis seed germination, but how methionine works in seed germination of maize has not been elucidated. We compared the changes in germination rate, the contents of methionine and folates, and transcriptional levels using transcriptome analysis under water or exogenous methionine treatment. The results indicate that the application of methionine increases seed germination rate (95% versus 70%), leading to significant differences in the content of methionine at 36 h, which brought the rapid increase forward by 12 h in the embryo and endosperm. Transcriptome analysis shows that methionine mainly affects the proliferation and differentiation of cells in the embryo, and the degradation of storage substances and signal transduction in the endosperm. In particular, multiple phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes were triggered upon methionine treatment during germination. These results provide a theoretical foundation for promoting maize seed germination and serve as a valuable theoretical resource for seed priming strategies."
38009661,oil content  kernel,Multi-omics-driven advances in the understanding of triacylglycerol biosynthesis in oil seeds.,"Vegetable oils are rich sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids and energy as well as valuable sources of human food, animal feed, and bioenergy. Triacylglycerols, which are comprised of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone, are the main component of vegetable oils. Here, we review the development and application of multiple-level omics in major oilseeds and emphasize the progress in the analysis of the biological roles of key genes underlying seed oil content and quality in major oilseeds. Finally, we discuss future research directions in functional genomics research based on current omics and oil metabolic engineering strategies that aim to enhance seed oil content and quality, and specific fatty acids components according to either human health needs or industrial requirements."
38009862,response to salt; photoperiod response; days to flowering,ZmELF6-ZmPRR37 module regulates maize flowering and salt response.,"The control of flowering time in maize is crucial for reproductive success and yield, and it can be influenced by environmental stresses. Using the approaches of Ac/Ds transposon and transposable element amplicon sequencing techniques, we identified a Ds insertion mutant in the ZmPRR37 gene. The Ds insertion showed a significant correlation with days to anthesis. Further research indicated that ZmPRR37-CR knockout mutants exhibited early flowering, whereas ZmPRR37-overexpression lines displayed delayed flowering compared to WT under long-day (LD) conditions. We demonstrated that ZmPRR37 repressed the expression of ZmNF-YC2 and ZmNF-YA3 to delay flowering. Association analysis revealed a significant correlation between flowering time and a SNP2071-C/T located upstream of ZmPRR37. The SNP2071-C/T impacted the binding capacity of ZmELF6 to the promoter of ZmPRR37. ZmELF6 also acted as a flowering suppressor in maize under LD conditions. Notably, our study unveiled that ZmPRR37 can enhance salt stress tolerance in maize by directly regulating the expression of ABA-responsive gene ZmDhn1. ZmDhn1 negatively regulated maize salt stress resistance. In summary, our findings proposed a novel pathway for regulating photoperiodic flowering and responding to salt stress based on ZmPRR37 in maize, providing novel insights into the integration of abiotic stress signals into floral pathways."
38011108,response to Metarhizium robertsii,Maize response to endophytic Metarhizium robertsii is altered by water stress.,"To defend against damage from environmental stress, plants have evolved strategies to respond to stress efficiently. One such strategy includes forming mutualist relationships with endophytes which confer stress-alleviating plant defensive and growth promoting effects. Metarhizium robertsii is an entomopathogen and plant-protective and growth-promoting endophyte. To determine the context dependency of the relationship between M. robertsii and maize, we conducted a greenhouse experiment that imposed stress as deficit and excess soil moisture on maize plants which were inoculated or not inoculated with M. robertsii and measured plant growth and defense indicators. Maize height and endophytic root colonization by M. robertsii were positively correlated in the deficit water treatment, but not in the adequate or excess water treatments. The relative expression of ZmLOX1 in the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway was significantly greater in M. robertsii-inoculated than in non-inoculated plants, but water treatment had no effect. There was significant interaction between M. robertsii and water treatments on foliar concentrations of JA and jasmonoyl isoleucine (JA-ILE), suggesting that water stress impacts M. robertsii as a modulator of plant defense. Water stress, but not inoculation with M. robertsii, had a significant effect on the expression of MYB (p = 0.021) and foliar concentrations of abscisic acid (p<0.001), two signaling molecules associated with abiotic stress response. This study contributes toward understanding the highly sophisticated stress response signaling network and context dependency of endophytic mutualisms in crops."
38012865,insect response,A dual-subcellular localized β-glucosidase confers pathogen and insect resistance without a yield penalty in maize.,"Maize is one of the most important crops for food, cattle feed and energy production. However, maize is frequently attacked by various pathogens and pests, which pose a significant threat to maize yield and quality. Identification of quantitative trait loci and genes for resistance to pests will provide the basis for resistance breeding in maize. Here, a β-glucosidase ZmBGLU17 was identified as a resistance gene against Pythium aphanidermatum, one of the causal agents of corn stalk rot, by genome-wide association analysis. Genetic analysis showed that both structural variations at the promoter and a single nucleotide polymorphism at the fifth intron distinguish the two ZmBGLU17 alleles. The causative polymorphism near the GT-AG splice site activates cryptic alternative splicing and intron retention of ZmBGLU17 mRNA, leading to the downregulation of functional ZmBGLU17 transcripts. ZmBGLU17 localizes in both the extracellular matrix and vacuole and contribute to the accumulation of two defence metabolites lignin and DIMBOA. Silencing of ZmBGLU17 reduces maize resistance against P. aphanidermatum, while overexpression significantly enhances resistance of maize against both the oomycete pathogen P. aphanidermatum and the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis. Notably, ZmBGLU17 overexpression lines exhibited normal growth and yield phenotype in the field. Taken together, our findings reveal that the apoplastic and vacuolar localized ZmBGLU17 confers resistance to both pathogens and insect pests in maize without a yield penalty, by fine-tuning the accumulation of lignin and DIMBOA."
38019431,insect response; animal response,Feeding Assay to Study the Effect of Phytocytokines on Direct and Indirect Defense in Maize.,"Phytocytokines mediate defense against pests and pathogens. Many methods have been developed to study the physiological responses triggered by phytocytokines in dicot plants. Here, we describe a detailed peptide feeding protocol to study the effect of phytocytokines on direct and indirect anti-herbivore defense in maize. This method relies on peptide uptake by the excised maize seedling or leaves via the transpiration stream. The headspace volatiles from plant samples are then analyzed by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS), or by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The samples can also be further processed to evaluate phytocytokine-induced defense gene expression or phytohormone production."
38023907,response to low phosphorus,Functional analysis of ZmG6PE reveals its role in responses to low-phosphorus stress and regulation of grain yield in maize.,"A previous metabolomic and genome-wide association analysis of maize screened a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase (ZmG6PE) gene, which responds to low-phosphorus (LP) stress and regulates yield in maize's recombinant inbred lines (RILs). However, the relationship of ZmG6PE with phosphorus and yield remained elusive. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying response mechanism of the ZmG6PE gene to LP stress and its consequential impact on maize yield. The analysis indicated that ZmG6PE required the Aldose_epim conserved domain to maintain enzyme activity and localized in the nucleus and cell membrane. The zmg6pe mutants showed decreased biomass and sugar contents but had increased starch content in leaves under LP stress conditions. Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis showed that LP stress activated plant immune regulation in response to the LP stress through carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Notably, LP stress significantly reduced the synthesis of glucose-1-phosphate, mannose-6-phosphate, and β-alanine-related metabolites and changed the expression of related genes. ZmG6PE regulates LP stress by mediating the expression of ZmSPX6 and ZmPHT1.13. Overall, this study revealed that ZmG6PE affected the number of grains per ear, ear thickness, and ear weight under LP stress, indicating that ZmG6PE participates in the phosphate signaling pathway and affects maize yield-related traits through balancing carbohydrates homeostasis."
38030972,mycorrhizal infection,Systematic analysis of the Rboh gene family in seven gramineous plants and its roles in response to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in maize.,"Background: Plant respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) gene family produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), and it plays key roles in plant-microbe interaction. Most Rboh gene family-related studies mainly focused on dicotyledonous plants; however, little is known about the roles of Rboh genes in gramineae. 

Results: A total of 106 Rboh genes were identified in seven gramineae species, including Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Setaria italica, Hordeum vulgare, and Triticum aestivum. The Rboh protein sequences showed high similarities, suggesting that they may have conserved functions across different species. Duplication mode analysis detected whole-genome/segmental duplication (WGD)/(SD) and dispersed in the seven species. Interestingly, two local duplication (LD, including tandem and proximal duplication) modes were found in Z. mays, S. italica and H. vulgare, while four LD were detected in T. aestivum, indicating that these genes may have similar functions. Collinearity analysis indicated that Rboh genes are at a stable evolution state in all the seven species. Besides, Rboh genes from Z. mays were closely related to those from S. bicolor, consistent with the current understanding of plant evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes in the subgroups I and II may participate in plant-AM fungus symbiosis. Cis-element analysis showed that different numbers of elements are related to fungal induction in the promoter region. Expression profiles of Rboh genes in Z. mays suggested that Rboh genes had distinct spatial expression patterns. By inoculation with AM fungi, our transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of Rboh genes varies upon AM fungal inoculation. In particularly, ZmRbohF was significantly upregulated after inoculation with AM fungi. pZmRbohF::GUS expression analyses indicated that ZmRbohF was induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in maize. By comparing WT and ZmRbohF mutant, we found ZmRbohF had limited impact on the establishment of maize-AM fungi symbiosis, but play critical roles in regulating the proper development of arbuscules. 

Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution relationship of Rboh genes in seven gramineae species. Results showed that several Rboh genes regulate maize-AM fungal symbiosis process. This study provides valuable information for further studies of Rboh genes in gramineae."
38037456,response to Ustilago maydis,The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis targets the maize corepressor RELK2 to modulate host transcription for tumorigenesis.,"Ustilago maydis is a biotrophic fungus that causes tumor formation on all aerial parts of maize. U. maydis secretes effector proteins during penetration and colonization to successfully overcome the plant immune response and reprogram host physiology to promote infection. In this study, we functionally characterized the U. maydis effector protein Topless (TPL) interacting protein 6 (Tip6). We found that Tip6 interacts with the N-terminus of RELK2 through its two Ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs. We show that the EAR motifs are essential for the virulence function of Tip6 and critical for altering the nuclear distribution pattern of RELK2. We propose that Tip6 mimics the recruitment of RELK2 by plant repressor proteins, thus disrupting host transcriptional regulation. We show that a large group of AP2/ERF B1 subfamily transcription factors are misregulated in the presence of Tip6. Our study suggests a regulatory mechanism where the U. maydis effector Tip6 utilizes repressive domains to recruit the corepressor RELK2 to disrupt the transcriptional networks of the host plant."
38038768,dormancy,Identification and validation of seed dormancy loci and candidate genes and construction of regulatory networks by WGCNA in maize introgression lines.,"Seventeen PHS-QTLs and candidate genes were obtained, including eleven major loci, three under multiple environments and two with co-localization by the other mapping methods; The functions of three candidate genes were validated using mutants; nine target proteins and five networks were filtered by joint analysis of GWAS and WGCNA. Seed dormancy (SD) and pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) affect yield, as well as grain and hybrid quality in seed production. Therefore, identification of genetic and regulatory pathways underlying PHS and SD is key to gene function analysis, allelic variation mining and genetic improvement. In this study, 78,360 SNPs by SLAF-seq of 230 maize chromosome segment introgression lines (ILs), PHS under five environments were used to conduct GWAS (genome wide association study) (a threshold of 1/n), and seventeen unreported PHS QTLs were obtained, including eleven QTLs with PVE > 10% and three QTLs under multiple environments. Two QTL loci were co-located between the other two genetic mapping methods. Using differential gene expression analyses at two stages of grain development, gene functional analysis of Arabidopsis mutants, and gene functional analysis in the QTL region, seventeen PHS QTL-linked candidate genes were identified, and their five molecular regulatory networks constructed. Based on the Arabidopsis T-DNA mutations, three candidate genes were shown to regulate for SD and PHS. Meanwhile, using RNA-seq of grain development, the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed, deducing five regulatory pathways and target genes that regulate PHS and SD. Based on the conjoint analysis of GWAS and WGCNA, four pathways, nine target proteins and target genes were revealed, most of which regulate cell wall metabolism, cell proliferation and seed dehydration tolerance. This has important theoretical and practical significance for elucidating the genetic basis of maize PHS and SD, as well as mining of genetic resources and genetic improvement of traits."
38041011,response to salt,Dynamic physiological and transcriptomic changes reveal memory effects of salt stress in maize.,"Background: Pre-exposing plants to abiotic stresses can induce stress memory, which is crucial for adapting to subsequent stress exposure. Although numerous genes involved in salt stress response have been identified, the understanding of memory responses to salt stress remains limited. 
Results: In this study, we conducted physiological and transcriptional assays on maize plants subjected to recurrent salt stress to characterize salt stress memory. During the second exposure to salt stress, the plants exhibited enhanced salt resistance, as evidenced by increased proline content and higher POD and SOD activity, along with decreased MDA content, indicative of physiological memory behavior. Transcriptional analysis revealed fewer differentially expressed genes and variations in response processes during the second exposure compared to the first, indicative of transcriptional memory behavior. A total of 2,213 salt stress memory genes (SMGs) were identified and categorized into four response patterns. The most prominent group of SMGs consisted of genes with elevated expression during the first exposure to salt stress but reduced expression after recurrent exposure to salt stress, or vice versa ([+ / −] or [− / +]), indicating that a revised response is a crucial process in plant stress memory. Furthermore, nine transcription factors (TFs) (WRKY40, WRKY46, WRKY53, WRKY18, WRKY33, WRKY70, MYB15, KNAT7, and WRKY54) were identified as crucial factors related to salt stress memory. These TFs regulate over 53% of SMGs, underscoring their potential significance in salt stress memory. 
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that maize can develop salt stress memory, and the genes identified here will aid in the genetic improvement of maize and other crops."
38051956,response to Cercospora; response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; disease response; response to Exserohilum turcicum; response to Clavibacter michiganense; response to multiple leaf diseases,Identification of loci conferring resistance to four foliar diseases of maize,"Foliar diseases of maize are among the most important diseases of maize worldwide. This study focused on four major foliar diseases of maize: Goss’s wilt (GW), gray leaf spot (GLS), northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) and southern corn leaf blight (SCLB). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for resistance to GW was conducted in four disease resistance introgression line (DRIL) populations with Oh7B as the common recurrent parent and Ki3, NC262, NC304, and NC344 as recurrent donor parents. Mapping results for GW resistance were combined with previous studies for GLS, NCLB and SCLB resistance in the same four populations. We conducted 1) individual linkage mapping analysis to identify QTL specific to each disease and population; 2) Mahalanobis distance analysis to identify putative multiple disease resistance regions for each population; and 3) joint linkage mapping to identify QTL across the four populations for each disease. We identified three lines that were resistant to all four diseases. We mapped 13 GW QTLs in the individual populations and an additional six using joint linkage mapping. All GW QTL had small effects, confirming that resistance to GW is highly quantitative. We report several potentially important chromosomal bins associated with multiple disease resistance including 1.02, 1.03, 3.04, 4.06, 4.08, and 9.03. Together, these findings indicate that disease QTL distribution is not random and that there are locations in the genome that confer resistance to multiple diseases. Furthermore, resistance to bacterial and fungal diseases are not entirely distinct, and we identified lines resistant to both fungi and bacteria, as well as loci that confer resistance to both bacterial and fungal diseases."
38053761,Growth and Development; leaf development,Determinants of photochemical characteristics of the photosynthetic electron transport chain of maize.,"Introduction: The photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC) is the bridge that links energy harvesting during the photophysical reactions at one end and energy consumption during the biochemical reactions at the other. Its functioning is thus fundamental for the proper balance between energy supply and demand in photosynthesis. Currently, there is a lack of understanding regarding how the structural properties of the ETC are affected by nutrient availability and plant developmental stages, which is a major roadblock to comprehensive modeling of photosynthesis. 

Methods: Redox parameters reflect the structural controls of ETC on the photochemical reactions and electron transport. We conducted joint measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and gas exchange under systematically varying environmental conditions and growth stages of maize and sampled foliar nutrient contents. We utilized the recently developed steady-state photochemical model to infer redox parameters of electron transport from these measurements. 

Results and discussion: We found that the inferred values of these photochemical redox parameters varied with leaf macronutrient content. These variations may be caused either directly by these nutrients being components of protein complexes on the ETC or indirectly by their impacts on the structural integrity of the thylakoid and feedback from the biochemical reactions. Also, the redox parameters varied with plant morphology and developmental stage, reflecting seasonal changes in the structural properties of the ETC. Our findings will facilitate the parameterization and simulation of complete models of photosynthesis."
38058237,kernel development,Defective kernel 58 encodes an Rrp15p domain-containing protein essential to ribosome biogenesis and seed development in maize.,"Ribosome biogenesis is a highly dynamic and orchestrated process facilitated by hundreds of ribosomal biogenesis factors and small nucleolar RNAs. While many of the advances are derived from studies in yeast, ribosome biogenesis remains largely unknown in plants despite its importance to plant growth and development. Through characterizing the maize (Zea mays) defective kernel and embryo-lethal mutant dek58, we show that DEK58 encodes an Rrp15p domain-containing protein with 15.3% identity to yeast Rrp15. Over-expression of DEK58 rescues the mutant phenotype. DEK58 is localized in the nucleolus. Ribosome profiling and RNA gel blot analyses show that the absence of DEK58 reduces ribosome assembly and impedes pre-rRNA processing, accompanied by the accumulation of nearly all the pre-rRNA processing intermediates and the production of an aberrant processing product P-25S*. DEK58 interacts with ZmSSF1, a maize homolog of the yeast Ssf1 in the 60S processome. DEK58 and ZmSSF1 interact with ZmCK2α, a putative component of the yeast UTP-C complex involved in the small ribosomal subunit processome. These results demonstrate that DEK58 is essential to seed development in maize. It functions in the early stage of pre-rRNA processing in ribosome biogenesis, possibly through interacting with ZmSSF1 and ZmCK2α in maize."
38058244,response to Cercospora,ZmWAK02 encoding an RD-WAK protein confers maize resistance against gray leaf spot.,"Gray leaf spot (GLS) caused by Cercospora zeina or C. zeae-maydis is a major maize disease throughout the world. Although more than 100 QTLs resistant against GLS have been identified, very few of them have been cloned. Here, we identified a major resistance QTL against GLS, qRglsSB, explaining 58.42% phenotypic variation in SB12×SA101 BC1 F1 population. By fine-mapping, it was narrowed down into a 928 kb region. By using transgenic lines, mutants and complementation lines, it was confirmed that the ZmWAK02 gene, encoding an RD wall-associated kinase, is the responsible gene in qRglsSB resistant against GLS. The introgression of the ZmWAK02 gene into hybrid lines significantly improves their grain yield in the presence of GLS pressure and does not reduce their grain yield in the absence of GLS. In summary, we cloned a gene, ZmWAK02, conferring large effect of GLS resistance and confirmed its great value in maize breeding."
38072329,Abiotic stress response,"A novel maize F-bZIP member, ZmbZIP76, functions as a positive regulator in ABA-mediated abiotic stress tolerance by binding to ACGT-containing elements.","The group F-bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis are involved in nutrient deficiency or salt stress responses. Nevertheless, our learning about the functions of group F-bZIP genes in maize remains limited. Here, we cloned a new F-bZIP gene (ZmbZIP76) from maize inbred line He344. The expression of ZmbZIP76 in maize was dramatically induced by high salt, osmotic stress and abscisic acid. Accordingly, overexpression of ZmbZIP76 increased tolerance of transgenic plants to salt and osmotic stress. In addition, ZmbZIP76 functions as a nuclear transcription factor and upregulates the expression of a range of abiotic stress-responsive genes by binding to the ACGT-containing elements, leading to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability, increased abscisic acid level, proline content, and ratio of K+/Na+, reduced water loss rate, and membrane damage. These physiological changes caused by ZmbZIP76 ultimately enhanced tolerance of transgenic plants to salt and osmotic stress."
38073308,cytoplasmic male sterility,A P-type pentatricopeptide repeat protein ZmRF5 promotes 5' region partial cleavages of atp6c transcripts to restore the fertility of CMS-C maize by recruiting a splicing factor.,"A fast evolution within mitochondria genome(s) often generates discords between nuclear and mitochondria, which is manifested as cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and fertility restoration (Rf) system. The maize CMS-C trait is regulated by the chimeric mitochondrial gene, atp6c, and can be recovered by the restorer gene ZmRf5. Through positional cloning in this study, we identified the nuclear restorer gene, ZmRf5, which encodes a P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family protein. The over-expression of ZmRf5 brought back the fertility to CMS-C plants, whereas its genomic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 induced abortive pollens in the restorer line. ZmRF5 is sorted to mitochondria, and recruited RS31A, a splicing factor, through MORF8 to form a cleaving/restoring complex, which promoted the cleaving of the CMS-associated transcripts atp6c by shifting the major cleavage site from 480th nt to 344 th nt for fast degradation, and preserved just right amount of atp6c RNA for protein translation, providing adequate ATP6C to assembly complex V, thus restoring male fertility. Interestingly, ATP6C in the sterile line CMo17A, with similar cytology and physiology changes to YU87-1A, was accumulated much less than it in NMo17B, exhibiting a contrary trend in the YU87-1 nuclear genome previously reported, and was restored to normal level in the presence of ZmRF5. Collectively these findings unveil a new molecular mechanism underlying fertility restoration by which ZmRF5 cooperates with MORF8 and RS31A to restore CMS-C fertility in maize, complemented and perfected the sterility mechanism, and enrich the perspectives on communications between nucleus and mitochondria."
38077131,response to Rhizophagus irregularis; response to heat stress; response to cold stress,A multi-organ maize metabolic model connects temperature stress with energy production and reducing power generation.,"Climate change has adversely affected maize productivity. Thereby, a holistic understanding of metabolic crosstalk among its organs is important to address this issue. Thus, we reconstructed the first multi-organ maize metabolic model, iZMA6517, and contextualized it with heat and cold stress transcriptomics data using expression distributed reaction flux measurement (EXTREAM) algorithm. Furthermore, implementing metabolic bottleneck analysis on contextualized models revealed differences between these stresses. While both stresses had reducing power bottlenecks, heat stress had additional energy generation bottlenecks. We also performed thermodynamic driving force analysis, revealing thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis dictating the nature of temperature stress responses. Thus, a temperature-tolerant maize ideotype can be engineered by leveraging the proposed thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis. We experimentally inoculated maize root with a beneficial mycorrhizal fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, and as a proof-of-concept demonstrated its efficacy in alleviating temperature stress. Overall, this study will guide the engineering effort of temperature stress-tolerant maize ideotypes."
38082218,response to gibberellin,Insights into ZmWAKL in maize kernel development: genome-wide investigation and GA-mediated transcription,"Background: The functional roles of the Wall Associated Kinase (WAK) and Wall Associated Kinase Like (WAKL) families in cellular expansion and developmental processes have been well-established. However, the molecular regulation of these kinases in maize development is limited due to the absence of comprehensive genome-wide studies. 
Results: Through an in-depth analysis, we identified 58 maize WAKL genes, and classified them into three distinct phylogenetic clusters. Moreover, structural prediction analysis showed functional conservation among WAKLs across maize. Promoter analysis uncovered the existence of cis-acting elements associated with the transcriptional regulation of ZmWAKL genes by Gibberellic acid (GA). To further elucidate the role of WAKL genes in maize kernels, we focused on three highly expressed genes, viz ZmWAKL38, ZmWAKL42 and ZmWAKL52. Co-expression analyses revealed that their expression patterns exhibited a remarkable correlation with GA-responsive transcription factors (TF) TF5, TF6, and TF8, which displayed preferential expression in kernels. RT-qPCR analysis validated the upregulation of ZmWAKL38, ZmWAKL42, ZmWAKL52, TF5, TF6, and TF8 following GA treatment. Additionally, ZmWAKL52 showed significant increase of transcription in the present of TF8, with ZmWAKL52 localizing in both the plasma membrane and cell wall. TF5 positively regulated ZmWAKL38, while TF6 positively regulated ZmWAKL42. 
Conclusions: Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the characterization and regulatory mechanisms of specific ZmWAKL genes involved in maize kernel development, offering prospects for their utilization in maize breeding programs."
38093101,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; response to Curvularia leaf spot,Characterization and fine mapping of a maize lesion mimic mutant (Les8) with enhanced resistance to Curvularia leaf spot and southern leaf blight.,"A novel light-dependent dominant lesion mimic mutant with enhanced multiple disease resistance was physiologically, biochemically, and genetically characterized; the causal gene was fine mapped to a 909 kb interval containing 38 genes. Identification of genes that confer multiple disease resistance (MDR) is crucial for the improvement of maize disease resistance. However, very limited genes are identified as MDR genes in maize. In this study, we characterized a dominant disease lesion mimics 8 (Les8) mutant that had chlorotic lesions on the leaves and showed enhanced resistance to both curvularia leaf spot and southern leaf blight. Major agronomic traits were not obviously altered, while decreased chlorophyll content was observed in the mutant, and the genetic effect of the Les8 mutation was stable in different genetic backgrounds. By BSR-seq analysis and map-based cloning, the LES8 gene was mapped into a 909 kb region containing 38 candidate genes on chromosome 9 wherein no lesion mimic or disease-resistance genes were previously reported. Using transcriptomics analysis, we found that genes involved in defense responses and secondary metabolite biosynthesis were enriched in the significantly up-regulated genes, while genes involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate-related pathways were enriched in the significantly down-regulated genes in Les8. In addition, there was an overaccumulation of jasmonic acid and lignin but not salicylic acid in Les8. Taken together, this study revealed candidate genes and potential mechanism underlying Les8-conferred MDR in maize."
38093996,plant height; ear height,"Identification of QTNs, QTN-by-environment interactions for plant height and ear height in maize multi-environment GWAS.","Plant height (PH) and ear height (EH) are important traits associated with biomass, lodging resistance, and grain yield in maize. There were strong effects of genotype x environment interaction (GEI) on plant height and ear height of maize. In this study, 203 maize inbred lines were grown at five locations across China's Spring and Summer corn belts, and plant height (PH) and ear height (EH) phenotype data were collected and grouped using GGE biplot. Five locations fell into two distinct groups (or mega environments) that coincide with two corn ecological zones called Summer Corn Belt and Spring Corn Belt. In total, 73,174 SNPs collected using GBS sequencing platform were used as genotype data and a recently released multi-environment GWAS software package IIIVmrMLM was employed to identify QTNs and QTN x environment (corn belt) interaction (QEIs); 12 and 11 statistically significant QEIs for PH and EH were detected respectively and their phenotypic effects were further partitioned into Add*E and Dom*E components. There were 28 and 25 corn-belt-specific QTNs for PH and EH identified, respectively. The result shows that there are a large number of genetic loci underlying the PH and EH GEIs and IIIVmrMLM is a powerful tool in discovering QTNs that have significant QTN-by-Environment interaction. PH and EH candidate genes were annotated based on transcriptomic analysis and haplotype analysis. EH related-QEI S10_135 (Zm00001d025947, saur76, small auxin up RNA76) and PH related-QEI S4_4 (Zm00001d049692, mads32, encoding MADS-transcription factor 32), and corn-belt specific QTNs including S10_4 (Zm00001d023333, sdg127, set domain gene127) and S7_1 (Zm00001d018614, GLR3.4, and glutamate receptor 3.4 or Zm00001d018616, DDRGK domain-containing protein) were reported, and the relationship among GEIs, QEIs and phenotypic plasticity and their biological and breeding implications were discussed."
38100891,oleic acid level; drought response; palmitic acid level; 2 hexadecadienoic acid level; stearic acid level; palmitoleic acid level; linoleic acid level; linolenic acid level,Altered fatty acid composition confers improved drought acclimation in maize.,"Drought induces alteration in membrane lipid composition in plants; however, still little is known about whether membrane lipid remodeling plays a role in plant drought acclimation, including both drought tolerance and recovery, especially in crops. Here, we imposed natural progressive drought and re-watering in 18 maize genotypes at the seedling stage, and analyzed the physiological responses, drought tolerance and drought acclimation capabilities, contents of lipids, and fatty acid compositions. The results showed that drought caused significant reductions in shoot dry weight, relative water content, Fv/Fm, total lipid content, and double bond index (DBI) in most genotypes, while re-watering partially recovered these reductions. Meanwhile, the total lipid content, fatty acid composition, and DBI were also changed obviously in response to drought and re-watering. In order to explore the relationship between membrane lipid change and plant drought response, we did a principal component analysis. The results showed that C18:3 fatty acid contributed greatly to drought tolerance, and C16:2 and C16:3 fatty acids were more responsible for drought recovery. Meanwhile, DBI showed significant positive correlations with shoot dry weight and relative water content, but a negative association with lipid peroxidation, and more importantly, DBI was important for both drought tolerance and recovery. These alterations in membrane lipid composition may facilitate increasing membrane fluidity and decreasing membrane damage, thus maintaining the high photosynthetic capability under drought. Our results suggest that lipid remodeling is important for drought tolerance and recovery in crops, and different fatty acid species have different roles in crop drought acclimation."
38108117,response to salt,Designing salt stress-resilient crops: Current progress and future challenges.,"Excess soil salinity affects large regions of land and is a major hindrance to crop production worldwide. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of plant salt tolerance has scientific importance and practical significance. In recent decades, studies have characterized hundreds of genes associated with plant responses to salt stress in different plant species. These studies have substantially advanced our molecular and genetic understanding of salt tolerance in plants and have introduced an era of molecular design breeding of salt-tolerant crops. This review summarizes our current knowledge of plant salt tolerance, emphasizing advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of osmotic stress tolerance, salt ion transport and compartmentalization, oxidative stress tolerance, alkaline stress tolerance, and the trade-off between growth and salt tolerance. We also examine recent advances in understanding natural variation in the salt tolerance of crops and discuss possible strategies and challenges for designing salt stress-resilient crops. We focus on the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the four most-studied crops: rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), and soybean (Glycine max).

38113320,stalk quality,Genetic basis of maize stalk strength decoded via linkage and association mapping.,"Stalk lodging is a severe problem that limits maize production worldwide, although little attention has been given to its genetic basis. Here we measured rind penetrometer resistance (RPR), an effective index for stalk lodging, in a multi-parent population of 1948 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and an association population of 508 inbred lines (AMP508). Linkage and association mapping identified 53 and 29 single quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 50 and 19 pairs of epistatic interactions for RPR in the multi-parent population and AMP508 population, respectively. Phenotypic variation explained by all identified epistatic QTLs (up to ~5%) was much less than that explained by all single additive QTLs (up to ~33% in the multi-parent population and ~ 60% in the AMP508 population). Among all detected QTLs, only eight single QTLs explained >10% of phenotypic variation in single RIL populations. Alleles that increased RPR were enriched in tropical/subtropical (TST) groups from the AMP508 population. Based on genome-wide association studies in both populations, we identified 137 candidate genes affecting RPR, which were assigned to multiple biological processes, such as the biosynthesis of cell wall components. Sixty-six candidate genes were cross-validated by multiple methods or populations. Most importantly, 23 candidate genes were upregulated or downregulated in high-RPR lines relative to low-RPR lines, supporting the associations between candidate genes and RPR. These findings reveal the complex nature of the genetic basis underlying RPR and provide loci or candidate genes for developing elite varieties that are resistant to stalk lodging via molecular breeding."
38114353,response to maize rough dwarf virus,ZmGLK36 transcription factor bestows viral resistance in rice and wheat,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) threatens the sustainable production of major cereal crops. Recently, Xu et al. reported a new resistance gene, ZmGLK36, which promotes MRDD resistance in maize by increasing jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defence. This discovery provides opportunities to develop resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) in other cereal crops such as rice and wheat."
38123363,leaf angle,Genetic mapping of dynamic control of leaf angle across multiple canopy levels in maize.,"Optimizing leaf angle and other canopy architecture traits has helped modern maize (Zea mays L.) become adapted to higher planting densities over the last 60 years. Traditional investigations into genetic control of leaf angle have focused on one leaf or the average of multiple leaves; as a result, our understanding of genetic control across multiple canopy levels is still limited. To address this, genetic mapping across four canopy levels was conducted in the present study to investigate the genetic control of leaf angle across the canopy. We developed two populations of doubled haploid lines derived from three inbreds with distinct leaf angle phenotypes. These populations were genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotyped for leaf angle at four different canopy levels over multiple years. To understand how leaf angle changes across the canopy, the four measurements were used to derive three additional traits. Composite interval mapping was conducted with the leaf-specific measurements and the derived traits. A set of 59 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were uncovered for seven traits, and two genomic regions were consistently detected across multiple canopy levels. Additionally, seven genomic regions were found to contain consistent QTLs with either relatively stable or dynamic effects at different canopy levels. Prioritizing the selection of QTLs with dynamic effects across the canopy will aid breeders in selecting maize hybrids with the ideal canopy architecture that continues to maximize yield on a per area basis under increasing planting densities."
38124377,drought response; foliar senescence,Exogenous Methylglyoxal Alleviates Drought-Induced ''Plant Diabetes'' and Leaf Senescence in Maize.,"Drought-induced leaf senescence is related to high sugar levels, which bears resemblance to the syndrome of diabetes in human. However, the underlying mechanisms of plant diabetes on carbon imbalance in maize and corresponding detoxification strategy have not been well-understood. Here, we investigate the regulatory mechanism of exogenous MG on plant diabetes under drought stress through foliar spraying application during grain-filling stage. Results demonstrated that exogenous MG delayed leaf senescence and promoted photoassimilation, thereby retrieving 14% drought-induced yield loss. Transcriptome and metabolite analyses revealed that drought increased sugar accumulation in leaf with inhibition of sugar transporters facilitating phloem loading. This led to disequilibrium of glycolysis and over-accumulation of endogenous MG. Contrarily, exogenous MG upregulated glycolytic flux and glyoxalase system catabolizing endogenous MG and advanced glycation end-products, ultimately alleviating plant diabetes. Besides, the genes facilitating anabolism and catabolism of trehalose-6-phosphate were promoted and suppressed by drought, respectively, whereas exogenous MG reversed this effect, implying trehalose-6-phosphate signaling in plant diabetes mediation. Moreover, exogenous MG activated phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, promoting lignin and phenol contents for resilience. Collectively, our findings support that exogenous MG activates the defense-related pathway to alleviate the toxicity derived from plant diabetes, thereby maintaining leaf function and yield production under drought."
38128552,water use efficiency,Localized measurements of water potential reveal large loss of conductance in living tissues of maize leaves.,"The water status of the living tissue in leaves between the xylem and stomata (outside xylem zone - OXZ) plays a critical role for plant function and global mass and energy balance but has remained largely inaccessible. We resolve the local water relations of OXZ tissue using a nanogel reporter of water potential (ψ), AquaDust, that enables an in-situ, non-destructive measurement of both ψ of xylem and highly localized ψ at the terminus of transpiration in the OXZ. Working in maize (Zea mays L.), these localized measurements reveal gradients in the OXZ that are several fold larger than those based on conventional methods and values of ψ in the mesophyll apoplast well below the macroscopic turgor loss potential. We find a strong loss of hydraulic conductance in both the bundle sheath and the mesophyll with decreasing xylem potential but not with evaporative demand. Our measurements suggest the OXZ plays an active role in regulating the transpiration path, and our methods provide the means to study this phenomenon."
38131117,ear height; days to flowering; plant height; leaf angle; leaf canopy architecture; root morphology; response to plant population,Breeding maize of ideal plant architecture for high-density planting tolerance through modulating shade avoidance response and beyond.,"Maize is a major staple crop widely used as food, animal feed, and raw materials in industrial production. High-density planting is a major factor contributing to the continuous increase of maize yield. However, high planting density usually triggers a shade avoidance response and causes increased plant height and ear height, resulting in lodging and yield loss. Reduced plant height and ear height, more erect leaf angle, reduced tassel branch number, earlier flowering, and strong root system architecture are five key morphological traits required for maize adaption to high-density planting. In this review, we summarize recent advances in deciphering the genetic and molecular mechanisms of maize involved in response to high-density planting. We also discuss some strategies for breeding advanced maize cultivars with superior performance under high-density planting conditions."
38135780,response to salt; response to cold stress,The maize ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ZmMRPA6 confers cold and salt stress tolerance in plants,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins are major transmembrane transporters that play significant roles in plant development against various abiotic stresses. However, available information regarding stress-related ABC genes in maize is minimal. In this study, a maize ABC transporter gene, ZmMRPA6, was identified through genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) for cold tolerance in maize seeds germination and functionally characterized. During germination and seedling stages, the zmmrpa6 mutant exhibited enhanced resistance to cold or salt stress. Mutated of ZmMRPA6 did not affect the expression of downstream response genes related cold or salt response at the transcriptional level. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that most of the differential proteins between zmmrpa6 and wild-type plants were involved in response to stress process including oxidative reduction, hydrolase activity, small molecule metabolism, and photosynthesis process. Meanwhile, the plants which lack the ZmMRPA6 homologous genes AtABCC4 or AtABCC14 were sensitive to salt stress in Arabidopsis. These results indicated that ZmMRPA6 and its homologous genes play a conserved role in cold and salt stress, and functional differentiation occurs in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. In summary, these findings dramatically improved our understanding of the function of ABC transporters resistance to abiotic stresses in plants. 
Key message: ZmMRPA6 was cloned and characterized as the first ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in maize to be proven to participate in cold and salt tolerance. Homologous genes AtABCC4 and AtABCC14 of ZmMRPA6 also responded to salt stress."
38148416,drought response,Gene editing of ZmGA20ox3 improves plant architecture and drought tolerance in maize.,"Editing ZmGA20ox3 can achieve the effect similar to applying Cycocel, which can reduce maize plant height and enhance stress resistance. Drought stress, a major plant abiotic stress, is capable of suppressing crop yield performance severely. However, the trade-off between crop drought tolerance and yield performance turns out to be significantly challenging in drought-resistant crop breeding. Several phytohormones [e.g., gibberellin (GA)] have been reported to play a certain role in plant drought response, which also take on critical significance in plant growth and development. In this study, the loss-of-function mutations of GA biosynthesis enzyme ZmGA20ox3 were produced using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in maize. As indicated by the result of 2-year field trials, the above-mentioned mutants displayed semi-dwarfing phenotype with the decrease of GA1, and almost no yield loss was generated compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Interestingly, as revealed by the transcriptome analysis, differential expressed genes (DEGs) were notably enriched in abiotic stress progresses, and biochemical tests indicated the significantly increased ABA, JA, and DIMBOA levels in mutants, suggesting that ZmGA20ox3 may take on vital significance in stress response in maize. The in-depth analysis suggested that the loss function of ZmGA20ox3 can enhance drought tolerance in maize seedling, reduce Anthesis-Silking Interval (ASI) delay while decreasing the yield loss significantly in the field under drought conditions. The results of this study supported that regulating ZmGA20ox3 can improve plant height while enhancing drought resistance in maize, thus serving as a novel method for drought-resistant genetic improvement in maize."
38163293,kernel size; kernel weight,Genetic variation in ZmKW1 contributes to kernel weight and size in dent corn and popcorn.,"Kernel weight is a critical factor that essentially affects maize (Zea mays) yield. In natural inbred lines, popcorn kernels exhibit overtly smaller sizes compared to dent corn kernels, and kernel weight, which is controlled by multiple genetic loci, varies widely. Here, we characterized a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 1, responsible for controlling kernel weight (qKW1) and size. The qKW1 locus encodes a protein containing a seven in absentia domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, expressed prominently from the top to the middle region of the endosperm. The presence and function of qKW1 were confirmed through ZmKW1 gene editing, where the mutations in ZmKW1 within dent corn significantly increased kernel weight, consistent with alterations in kernel size, while overexpression of ZmKW1 had the opposite effect. ZmKW1 acts as a negative regulator of kernel weight and size by reducing both the number and size of the endosperm cells and impacting endosperm filling. Notably, the popcorn allele qKW1N and the dent corn allele qKW1D encode identical proteins; however, the differences in promoter activity arise due to the insertion of an Indel-1346 sequence in the qKW1N promoter, resulting in higher expression levels compared to qKW1D , thus contributing to the variation in kernel weight and size between popcorn and dent corn kernels. Linkage disequilibrium analysis of the 2.8 kb promoter region of ZmKW1 in a dataset comprising 111 maize association panels identified two distinct haplotypes. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying kernel development and yield regulation in dent corn and popcorn, with a specific focus on the role of the ubiquitination system."
38163896,response to Cercospora,Genetic dissection of resistance to gray leaf spot by genome-wide association study in a multi-parent maize population.,"Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying gray leaf spot (GLS) resistance in maize is crucial for breeding GLS-resistant inbred lines and commercial hybrids. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene functional annotation are valuable methods for identifying potential SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) and candidate genes associated with GLS resistance in maize.In this study, a total of 757 lines from five recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of maize at the F7 generation were used to construct an association mapping panel. SNPs obtained through genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) were used to perform GWAS for GLS resistance using a linear mixture model in GEMMA. Candidate gene screening was performed by analyzing the 10 kb region upstream and downstream of the significantly associated SNPs linked to GLS resistance. Through GWAS analysis of multi-location phenotypic data, we identified ten candidate genes that were consistently detected in two locations or from one location along with best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE). One of these candidate genes, Zm00001d003257 that might impact GLS resistance by regulating gibberellin content, was further identified through haplotype-based association analysis, candidate gene expression analysis, and previous reports.The discovery of the novel candidate gene provides valuable genomic resources for elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying GLS resistance in maize. Additionally, these findings will contribute to the development of new genetic resources by utilizing molecular markers to facilitate the genetic improvement and breeding of maize for GLS resistance."
38163910,grain moisture,Reveal the kernel dehydration mechanisms in maize based on proteomic and metabolomic analysis.,"Kernel dehydration is an important factor for the mechanized harvest in maize. Kernel moisture content (KMC) and kernel dehydration rate (KDR) are important indicators for kernel dehydration. Although quantitative trait loci and genes related to KMC have been identified, where most of them only focus on the KMC at harvest, these are still far from sufficient to explain all genetic variations, and the relevant regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we tried to reveal the key proteins and metabolites related to kernel dehydration in proteome and metabolome levels. Moreover, we preliminarily explored the relevant metabolic pathways that affect kernel dehydration combined proteome and metabolome. These results could accelerate the development of further mechanized maize technologies.In this study, three maize inbred lines (KB182, KB207, and KB020) with different KMC and KDR were subjected to proteomic analysis 35, 42, and 49 days after pollination (DAP). In total, 8,358 proteins were quantified, and 2,779 of them were differentially expressed proteins in different inbred lines or at different stages. By comparative analysis, K-means cluster, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on the proteome data, some important proteins were identified, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress and defense response, lipid metabolism, and seed development. Through metabolomics analysis of KB182 and KB020 kernels at 42 DAP, 18 significantly different metabolites, including glucose, fructose, proline, and glycerol, were identified.In sum, we inferred that kernel dehydration could be regulated through carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant systems, and late embryogenesis abundant protein and heat shock protein expression, all of which were considered as important regulatory factors during kernel dehydration process. These results shed light on kernel dehydration and provide new insights into developing cultivars with low moisture content."
38164019,drought response,ZmC2H2-149 negatively regulates drought tolerance by repressing ZmHSD1 in maize.,"Drought is a major abiotic stress that limits maize production worldwide. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve drought tolerance in crop plants for sustainable agriculture. In this study, we examined the roles of Cys2 /His2 zinc-finger-proteins (C2H2-ZFPs) in maize's drought tolerance as C2H2-ZFPs have been implicated for plant stress tolerance. By subjecting 150 Ac/Ds mutant lines to drought stress, we successfully identified a Ds-insertion mutant, zmc2h2-149, which shows increased tolerance to drought stress. Overexpression of ZmC2H2-149 in maize led to a decrease in both drought tolerance and crop yield. DAP-Seq, RNA-Seq, Y1H and LUC assays additionally showed that ZmC2H2-149 directly suppresses the expression of a positive drought tolerance regulator, ZmHSD1 (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1). Consistently, the zmhsd1 mutants exhibited decreased drought tolerance and grain yield under water deficit conditions compared to their respective wild-type plants. Our findings thus demonstrated that ZmC2H2-149 can regulate ZmHSD1 for drought stress tolerance in maize, offering valuable theoretical and genetic resources for maize breeding programmes that aim for improving drought tolerance."
38174365,male fertility,Receptor-like kinases and their signaling cascades for plant male fertility: loyal messengers,"Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are evolved for plant cell–cell communications. The typical RLK protein contains an extracellular and hypervariable N-terminus to perceive various signals, a transmembrane domain to anchor into plasma membrane, and a cytoplasmic, highly conserved kinase domain to phosphorylate target proteins. To date, RLKs have manifested their significance in a myriad of biological processes during plant reproductive growth, especially in male fertility. This review first summarizes a recent update on RLKs and their interacting protein partners controlling anther and pollen development, pollen release from dehisced anther, and pollen function during pollination and fertilization. Then, regulatory networks of RLK signaling pathways are proposed. In addition, we predict RLKs in maize and rice genome, obtain homologs of well-studied RLKs from phylogeny of three subfamilies and then analyze their expression patterns in developing anthers of maize and rice to excavate potential RLKs regulating male fertility in crops. Finally, current challenges and future prospects regarding RLKs are discussed. This review will contribute to a better understanding of plant male fertility control by RLKs, creating potential male sterile lines, and inspiring innovative crop breeding methods."
38183327,inflorescence development; response to heat stress; Flowering,Heat stress and sexual reproduction in maize: unveiling the most pivotal factors and the biggest opportunities.,"The escalation in the intensity, frequency, and duration of high temperature (HT) stress is currently unparalleled, which aggravates the challenges for crop production. Yet, the stage-dependent responses of sexual reproductive organs to HT stress at the morphological, physiological, and molecular levels, remain inadequately explored, particularly in pivotal staple crops. This review synthesized current knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which HT stress induces abnormalities and aberrations in reproductive growth and development, as well as alters the morphology and function of florets and their constituents, flowering patterns, and the processes of pollination and fertilization in maize (Zea mays L.). We identified the stage-specific sensitivities to HT stress through compiling and analyzing hundreds of lines of evidence, and accurately defined the sensitive period from days to hours timescale. The microspore tetrad phase of pollen development and anthesis (especially shortly after pollination) are most sensitive to HT stress, and even brief temperature spikes during these stages can lead to significant kernel loss. Unfortunately, these weak links are hidden and often neglected in practice. The impetuses behind the heat-induced impairments in seed set are closely related to carbon, reactive oxygen species, phytohormone signals, ion (e.g., Ca2+) homeostasis, plasma membrane structure and function, and others. At last, the recent advancements in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying HT stress responses during maize sexual reproduction have been systematically summarized. This knowledge holds significant implications for the development of improved maize genotypes and effective crop management strategies to mitigate heat stress."
38185653,drought response,Utilizing transcriptomics and metabolomics to unravel key genes and metabolites of maize seedlings in response to drought stress.,"Background: Drought stress can substantially restrict maize growth and productivity, and global warming and an increasing frequency of extreme weather events are likely to result in more yield losses in the future. Therefore, unraveling the molecular mechanism underlying the response to drought stress is essential for breeding drought-resilient crops. 

Results: In this study, we subjected the 3-leaf-period plants of two maize inbred lines, a drought-tolerant line (si287) and a drought-sensitive line (X178), to drought stress for seven days while growing in a chamber. Subsequently, we measured physiological traits and analyzed transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of two inbred lines. Our KEGG analysis of genes and metabolites revealed significant differences in pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and biosynthesis of amino acids. Additionally, our joint analysis identified proline, tryptophan and phenylalanine are crucial amino acids for maize response to drought stress. Furthermore, we concentrated on tryptophan (Trp), which was found to enhance tolerance via IAA-ABA signaling, as well as SA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) consequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. We identified three hub genes in tryptophan biosynthesis, indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase (ZmAO1, 542,228), catalase 1 (ZmCAT1, 542,369), and flavin-containing monooxygenase 6 (ZmYUC6, 103,629,142), High expression of these genes plays a significant role in regulating drought tolerance. Two metabolites related to tryptophan biosynthesis, quinolinic acid, and kynurenine improved maize tolerance to drought stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. 

Conclusions: This study illuminates the mechanisms underlying the response of maize seedlings to drought stress. Especially, it identifies novel candidate genes and metabolites, enriching our understanding of the role of tryptophan in drought stress. The identification of distinct resistance mechanisms in maize inbred lines will facilitate the exploration of maize germplasm and the breeding of drought-resilient hybrids."
38192695,seed viability,An end-to-end seed vigor prediction model for imbalanced samples using hyperspectral image.,"Hyperspectral imaging is a key technology for non-destructive detection of seed vigor presently due to its capability to capture variations of optical properties in seeds. As the seed vigor data depends on the actual germination rate, it inevitably results in an imbalance between positive and negative samples. Additionally, hyperspectral image (HSI) suffers from feature redundancy and collinearity due to its inclusion of hundreds of wavelengths. It also creates a challenge to extract effective wavelength information in feature selection, however, which limits the ability of deep learning to extract features from HSI and accurately predict seed vigor. Accordingly, in this paper, we proposed a Focal-WAResNet network to predict seed vigor end-to-end, which improves the network performance and feature representation capability, and improves the accuracy of seed vigor prediction. Firstly, the focal loss function is utilized to adjust the loss weights of different sample categories to solve the problem of sample imbalance. Secondly, a WAResNet network is proposed to select characteristic wavelengths and predict seed vigor end-to-end, focusing on wavelengths with higher network weights, which enhance the ability of seed vigor prediction. To validate the effectiveness of this method, this study collected HSI of maize seeds for experimental verification, providing a reference for plant breeding. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, with an accuracy up to 98.48% and an F1 score of 95.9%."
38194910,shoot development; days to flowering; leaf development,Temporal regulation of vegetative phase change in plants.,"During their vegetative growth, plants reiteratively produce leaves, buds, and internodes at the apical end of the shoot. The identity of these organs changes as the shoot develops. Some traits change gradually, but others change in a coordinated fashion, allowing shoot development to be divided into discrete juvenile and adult phases. The transition between these phases is called vegetative phase change. Historically, vegetative phase change has been studied because it is thought to be associated with an increase in reproductive competence. However, this is not true for all species; indeed, heterochronic variation in the timing of vegetative phase change and flowering has made important contributions to plant evolution. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism of vegetative phase change, how the timing of this process is controlled by endogenous and environmental factors, and its ecological and evolutionary significance."
38198228,carotenoid content,The maize PLASTID TERMINAL OXIDASE (PTOX) locus controls the carotenoid content of kernels,"Carotenoids perform a broad range of important functions in humans; therefore, carotenoid biofortification of maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most highly produced cereal crops worldwide, would have a global impact on human health. PLASTID TERMINAL OXIDASE (PTOX) genes play an important role in carotenoid metabolism; however, the possible function of PTOX in carotenoid biosynthesis in maize has not yet been explored. In this study, we characterized the maize PTOX locus by forward- and reverse-genetic analyses. While most higher plant species possess a single copy of the PTOX gene, maize carries two tandemly duplicated copies. Characterization of mutants revealed that disruption of either copy resulted in a carotenoid-deficient phenotype. We identified mutations in the PTOX genes as being causal of the classic maize mutant, albescent1. Remarkably, overexpression of ZmPTOX1 significantly improved the content of carotenoids, especially β-carotene (provitamin A), which was increased by ~threefold, in maize kernels. Overall, our study shows that maize PTOX locus plays an important role in carotenoid biosynthesis in maize kernels and suggests that fine-tuning the expression of this gene could improve the nutritional value of cereal grains."
38200224,response to cold stress; leaf development,Cellular dynamics in the maize leaf growth zone during recovery from chilling depends on the leaf developmental stage.,"A novel non-steady-state kinematic analysis shows differences in cell division and expansion determining a better recovery from a 3-day cold spell in emerged compared to non-emerged maize leaves. Zea mays is highly sensitive to chilling which frequently occurs during its seedling stage. Although the direct effect of chilling is well studied, the mechanisms determining the subsequent recovery are still unknown. Our goal is to determine the cellular basis of the leaf growth response to chilling and during recovery of leaves exposed before or after their emergence. We first studied the effect of a 3-day cold spell on leaf growth at the plant level. Then, we performed a kinematic analysis to analyse the dynamics of cell division and elongation during recovery of the 4th leaf after exposure to cold before or after emergence. Our results demonstrated cold more strongly reduced the final length of non-emerged than emerged leaves (- 13 vs. - 18%). This was not related to growth differences during cold, but a faster and more complete recovery of the growth of emerged leaves. This difference was due to a higher cell division rate on the 1st and a higher cell elongation rate on the 2nd day of recovery, respectively. The dynamics of cell division and expansion during recovery determines developmental stage-specific differences in cold tolerance of maize leaves."
38206190,cuticular lipids; drought response,A genome-wide association study identifies genes associated with cuticular wax metabolism in maize.,"The plant cuticle is essential in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. To systematically elucidate the genetic architecture of maize (Zea mays L.) cuticular wax metabolism, two cuticular wax-related traits, the chlorophyll extraction rate (CER) and water loss rate (WLR) of 389 maize inbred lines, were investigated and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 1.25 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 57 non-redundant quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining 5.57%-15.07% of the phenotypic variation for each QTL were identified. These QTLs contained 183 genes, among which, 21 strong candidates were identified based on functional annotations and previous publications. Remarkably, 3 candidate genes that express differentially during cuticle development encode β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS). While KCS19was known to be involved in cuticle wax metabolism, KCS12 and KCS3 functions were not reported. The association between KCS12 and WLR was confirmed by re-sequencing 106 inbred lines, and the variation of WLR was significant between different haplotypes of ZmKCS12. In this study, the loss-of-function mutant of ZmKCS12 exhibited wrinkled leaf morphology, altered wax crystal morphology, and decreased C32 wax monomer levels, causing an increased water loss rate and sensitivity to drought. These results confirm that ZmKCS12 plays a vital role in maize C32 wax monomers synthesis and is critical for drought tolerance. In sum, through GWAS of two cuticular wax-associated traits, this study reveals comprehensively the genetic architecture in maize cuticular wax metabolism and provides a valuable reference for the genetic improvement of stress tolerance in maize."
38214462,response to cold stress; radiation use efficiency (RUE),Contrasting leaf-scale photosynthetic low-light response and its temperature dependency are key to differences in crop-scale radiation use efficiency.,"Radiation use efficiency (RUE) is a key crop adaptation trait that quantifies the potential amount of aboveground biomass produced by the crop per unit of solar energy intercepted. But it is unclear why elite maize and grain sorghum hybrids differ in their RUE at the crop level. Here, we used a non-traditional top-down approach via canopy photosynthesis modelling to identify leaf-level photosynthetic traits that are key to differences in crop-level RUE. A novel photosynthetic response measurement was developed and coupled with use of a Bayesian model fitting procedure, incorporating a C4 leaf photosynthesis model, to infer cohesive sets of photosynthetic parameters by simultaneously fitting responses to CO2 , light, and temperature. Statistically significant differences between leaf photosynthetic parameters of elite maize and grain sorghum hybrids were found across a range of leaf temperatures, in particular for effects on the quantum yield of photosynthesis, but also for the maximum enzymatic activity of Rubisco and PEPc. Simulation of diurnal canopy photosynthesis predicted that the leaf-level photosynthetic low-light response and its temperature dependency are key drivers of the performance of crop-level RUE, generating tastable hypotheses for further physiological analysis and bioengineering applications."
38214876,response to Azospirillum brasilense,Maize—Azospirillum brasilense interaction: accessing maize’s miRNA expression under the effect of an inhibitor of indole-3-acetic acid production by the plant,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non-coding RNAs. They play essential roles in plants’ physiology, as in the regulation of plant development, response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and symbiotic processes. This work aimed to better understand the importance of maize’s miRNA during Azospirillum-plant interaction when the plant indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production was inhibited with yucasin, an inhibitor of the TAM/YUC pathway. Twelve cDNA libraries from a previous Dual RNA-Seq experiment were used to analyze gene expression using a combined analysis approach. miRNA coding genes (miR) and their predicted mRNA targets were identified among the differentially expressed genes. Statistical differences among the groups indicate that Azospirillum brasilense, yucasin, IAA concentration, or all together could influence the expression of several maize’s miRNAs. The miRNA’s probable targets were identified, and some of them were observed to be differentially expressed. Dcl4, myb122, myb22, and morf3 mRNAs were probably regulated by their respective miRNAs. Other probable targets were observed responding to the IAA level, the bacterium, or all of them. A. brasilense was able to influence the expression of some maize’s miRNA, for example, miR159f, miR164a, miR169j, miR396c, and miR399c. The results allow us to conclude that the bacterium can influence directly or indirectly the expression of some of the identified mRNA targets, probably due to an IAA-independent pathway, and that they are somehow involved in the previously observed physiological effects."
38215563,chlorophyll content,Detection of chlorophyll content based on optical properties of maize leaves.,"The chlorophyll content reflects plants' photosynthetic capacity, growth stage, and nitrogen status. Maize is one of the three widely planted gain crops in the world. In order to offer useful information for the development of chlorophyll content detectors of maize leaves, a single integrating sphere system was used to measure the transmittance and reflectance spectra of maize leaves over the wavelength range of 500-950 nm. The linear relationships of transmittance and reflectance with chlorophyll content were investigated. The feature wavelengths (FWs) sensitive to chlorophyll content were extracted from the full transmittance and reflectance spectra using the successive projections algorithm (SPA). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for predicting the chlorophyll content were established using the full spectra and extracted FWs. The results showed that there were obvious linear relationships between transmittance and reflectance with chlorophyll content of maize leaves and the best linear relationships were found at 709 nm and 714 nm, respectively, with the linear correlation coefficients of 0.801 and 0.696, and the root-mean-squares error (RMSEP) of 0.321 mg·g-1 and 0.405 mg·g-1, respectively. Eight and 6 FWs were extracted from the transmittance and reflectance spectra, respectively. The PLSR model established using the selected FWs from transmittance spectra had better prediction performance with RMSEP of 0.208 mg·g-1 than using full transmittance spectra. The built PLSR models using the full reflectance spectra and extracted FWs had poor robustness. This research offers some theoretical basis for developing a maize leaf chlorophyll content detector based on transmittance or reflectance."
38223702,water use efficiency; ear development,Response of WUE of maize at ear stage to the coupling effect of CO2 and temperature.,"In the face of global warming, the photosynthesis and transpiration of plants will change greatly, which will ultimately affect the water use efficiency (WUE) of plants. In order to study the coupling effects of CO2 and temperature on WUE of maize at ear stage, 'Zhengdan 958' was taken as the research object, and 5 temperatures (20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C and 40 °C) and 11 CO2 concentration (400, 300, 200, 150, 100, 50, 400, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 μmol mol-1) were set to measure the parameters such as net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) of single leaves. The response of WUE (Pn/Tr) to CO2 and temperature was evaluated by a CO2 response model. The results show that at the same temperature, Pn and WUE increased with CO2 level, while Tr decreased as CO2 level increases; at the same CO2 concentration, Pn and Tr were both positively correlated with temperature, while WUE decreased with the increase of temperature. The maximum value of WUE was obtained when the CO2 concentration was 1000 μmol mol-1 and the temperature was 20.0 °C. The results suggest that global warming will not improve WUE of maize, which will bring more severe challenges to water-saving agriculture and food security."
38227608,disease response,Cloning of maize chitinase 1 gene and its expression in genetically transformed rice to confer resistance against rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae,"Fungal pathogens are one of the major reasons for biotic stress on rice (Oryza sativa L.), causing severe productivity losses every year. Breeding for host resistance is a mainstay of rice disease management, but conventional development of commercial resistant varieties is often slow. In contrast, the development of disease resistance by targeted genome manipulation has the potential to deliver resistant varieties more rapidly. The present study reports the first cloning of a synthetic maize chitinase 1 gene and its insertion in rice cv. (Basmati 385) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to confer resistance to the rice blast pathogen, Pyricularia oryzae. Several factors for transformation were optimized; we found that 4-week-old calli and an infection time of 15 minutes with Agrobacterium before colonization on co-cultivation media were the best-suited conditions. Moreover, 300 μM of acetosyringone in co-cultivation media for two days was exceptional in achieving the highest callus transformation frequency. Transgenic lines were analyzed using molecular and functional techniques. Successful integration of the gene into rice lines was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with primer sets specific to chitinase and hpt genes. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis of transformants indicated a strong association between transgene expression and elevated levels of resistance to rice blast. Functional validation of the integrated gene was performed by a detached leaf bioassay, which validated the efficacy of chitinase-mediated resistance in all transgenic Basmati 385 plants with variable levels of enhanced resistance against the P. oryzae. We concluded that overexpression of the maize chitinase 1 gene in Basmati 385 improved resistance against the pathogen. These findings will add new options to resistant germplasm resources for disease resistance breeding. The maize chitinase 1 gene demonstrated potential for genetic improvement of rice varieties against biotic stresses in future transformation programs."
38235209,leaf canopy architecture; tassel branch number,Genome-wide association analysis of plant architecture traits using doubled haploid lines derived from different cycles of the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic maize population.,"Selection in the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) maize population for high yield, grain moisture, and root and stalk lodging has indirectly modified plant architecture traits that are important for adaptation to high plant density. In this study, we developed doubled haploid (DH) lines from the BSSS maize population in the earliest cycle of recurrent selection (BSSS), cycle 17 of reciprocal recurrent selection, [BSSS(R)17] and the cross between the two cycles [BSSS/BSSS(R)C17]. We aimed to determine the phenotypic variation and changes in agronomic traits that have occurred through the recurrent selection program in this population and to identify genes or regions in the genome associated with the plant architecture changes observed in the different cycles of selection. We conducted a per se evaluation of DH lines focusing on high heritability traits important for adaptation to high planting density and grain yield. Trends for reducing flowering time, anthesis-silking interval, ear height, and the number of primary tassel branches in BSSS(R)17 DH lines compared to BSSS and BSSS/BSSS(R)C17 DH lines were observed. Additionally, the BSSS(R)C17 DH lines showed more upright flag leaf angles. Using the entire panel of DH lines increased the number of SNP markers identified within candidate genes associated with plant architecture traits. The genomic regions identified for plant architecture traits in this study may help to elucidate the genetic basis of these traits and facilitate future work about marker-assisted selection or map-based cloning in maize breeding programs."
38236419,drought response,"Effect of irrigation on wild and inbred maize with relation to the antioxidant status of pollens, flag leaves, and developing grains","The investigation was carried out to evaluate the net effect of limited irrigation on the antioxidant status of pollens, flag leaves, and developing grains of wild and inbred maize lines. Teosinte pollens showed the highest activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), and peroxidase (POX) under stressful conditions while LM 11 showed a significant decrease in APX, CAT, GR, and GST activities. Limited irrigations increased the contents of superoxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) to maximum levels in LM 11 leaves. The pollens, leaves, and developing grains of teosinte had the highest content of total phenols. Proline was maximum in the developing grains of teosinte and CML 32 while lowest in those of LM 11. Principal component analysis showed that LM 11 genotype and the respective antioxidant enzymes were in completely opposite quadrants. Chord analysis showed that CAT activity and total phenol content in pollens, leaves, and developing grains contributed towards most of the variations observed in teosinte and might be responsible for managing the yield attributes of genotype during stress conditions. The pollens and leaves of teosinte, with significant SOD activity, further helped in optimizing plant yield, under stressful conditions. CML 32 occupied intermediate position owing to the unaffected activities of most of the antioxidant enzymes and high content of antioxidants in its tissues. It may be concluded that the overall antioxidant status of tissues decides the tolerance behavior of plants."
38238629,response to Cercospora,The ZmWAKL–ZmWIK–ZmBLK1–ZmRBOH4 module provides quantitative resistance to gray leaf spot in maize,"Gray leaf spot (GLS), caused by the fungal pathogens Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina, is a major foliar disease of maize worldwide (Zea mays L.). Here we demonstrate that ZmWAKL encoding cell-wall-associated receptor kinase-like protein is the causative gene at the major quantitative disease resistance locus against GLS. The ZmWAKLY protein, encoded by the resistance allele, can self-associate and interact with a leucine-rich repeat immune-related kinase ZmWIK on the plasma membrane. The ZmWAKLY/ZmWIK receptor complex interacts with and phosphorylates the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) ZmBLK1, which in turn phosphorylates its downstream NADPH oxidase ZmRBOH4. Upon pathogen infection, ZmWAKLY phosphorylation activity is transiently increased, initiating immune signaling from ZmWAKLY, ZmWIK, ZmBLK1 to ZmRBOH4, ultimately triggering a reactive oxygen species burst. Our study thus uncovers the role of the maize ZmWAKL–ZmWIK–ZmBLK1–ZmRBOH4 receptor/signaling/executor module in perceiving the pathogen invasion, transducing immune signals, activating defense responses and conferring increased resistance to GLS."
38252634,light interception; leaf canopy architecture,Genetic regulation of self-organizing azimuthal canopy orientations and their impacts on light interception in maize,"The efficiency of solar radiation interception contributes to the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants. Light interception is a function of canopy architecture, including plant density; leaf number, length, width, and angle; and azimuthal canopy orientation. We report on the ability of some maize (Zea mays) genotypes to alter the orientations of their leaves during development in coordination with adjacent plants. Although the upper canopies of these genotypes retain the typical alternate-distichous phyllotaxy of maize, their leaves grow parallel to those of adjacent plants. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on this parallel canopy trait identified candidate genes, many of which are associated with shade avoidance syndrome, including phytochromeC2 . GWAS conducted on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by canopies also identified multiple candidate genes, including liguleless1 (lg1), previously defined by its role in ligule development. Under high plant densities, mutants of shade avoidance syndrome and liguleless genes (lg1, lg2 and Lg3) exhibit altered canopy patterns, viz., the numbers of interrow leaves are greatly reduced as compared to those of non-mutant controls, resulting in dramatically decreased PAR interception. In at least the case of lg2, this phenotype is not a consequence of abnormal ligule development. Instead, liguleless gene functions are required for normal light responses, including azimuth canopy re-orientation."
38262942,Abiotic stress response,Computational analysis of the AP2/ERF family in crops genome.,"Background: The Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor family has diverse functions that enhance development and torment resistance in the plant genome. In variation, the ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) family of TF's genes is extensive in the crop genome. Generally, the plant-specific ethylene-responsive factor family may divided by the dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) subfamily. So, the AP2/ERF super-family demonstrated the repeated AP2 domain during growth. The sole AP2 domain function represents abiotic stress resistance. Also, the AP2 with B3 domain enhances during the replication of brassinosteroid. 

Objective: The study objective is to investigate the Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor family in a model organism of the Arabidopsis thaliana for comparative analysis towards Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato), Brassica juncea (Indian and Chinese mustard), Zea mays L. (Maize) and Oryza sativa (Indian and Japanese Rice). So, examinations of the large AP2/ERF super-family are mandatory to explore the Apetala 2 (AP2) family, ERF family, DREB subfamily, and RAV family involved during growth and abiotic stress stimuli in crops. 

Methods: Therefore, perform bioinformatics and computational methods to the current knowledge of the Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor family and their subfamilies in the crop genome. This method may be valuable for functional analysis of particular genes and their families in the plant genome. 

Results: Observation data provided evidence of the Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) super-family and their sub-family present in Arabidopsis thaliana (Dicots) and compared with Solanum lycopersicum (Dicots), Brassica juncea (Dicots), Zea mays L. (Monocots) and Oryza sativa (Monocots). Also, remarks genes in Oryza sativa. This report upgraded the Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family in the crop genome. So, the analysis documented the conserved domain, motifs, and phylogenetic tree towards Dicots and Monocots species. Those outcomes will be valuable for future studies of the defensive Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor family in crops. 

Conclusion: Therefore, the study concluded that the several species-specific TF genes in the Apetala 2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family in Arabidopsis thaliana and compared with crop-species of Solanum lycopersicum, Brassica juncea, Zea mays L. and Oryza sativa. Those plant-specific genes regulate during growth and abiotic stress control in plants."
38263872,pollen viability,MSH7 confers quantitative variation in pollen fertility and boosts grain yield in maize.,"Fertile pollen is critical for the survival, fitness, and dispersal of flowering plants, and directly contributes to crop productivity. Extensive mutational screening studies have been carried out to dissect the genetic regulatory network determining pollen fertility, but we still lack fundamental knowledge about whether and how pollen fertility is controlled in natural populations. We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to show that ZmGEN1A and ZmMSH7, two DNA repair-related genes, confer natural variation in maize pollen fertility. Mutants defective in these genes exhibited abnormalities in meiotic or post-meiotic DNA repair, leading to reduced pollen fertility. More importantly, ZmMSH7 showed evidence of selection during maize domestication, and its disruption resulted in a substantial increase in grain yield for both inbred and hybrid. Overall, our study describes the first systematic examination of natural genetic effects on pollen fertility in plants, providing valuable genetic resources for optimizing male fertility. In addition, we find that ZmMSH7 represents a candidate for improvement of grain yield."
38277077,drought response,Overexpression of ZmSUS1 increased drought resistance of maize (Zea mays L.) by regulating sucrose metabolism and soluble sugar content.,"ZmSUS1 improved drought tolerance of maize by regulating sucrose metabolism and increasing soluble sugar content, and endowing transgenic maize with higher relative water content and photosynthesis levels. Sucrose synthase (SUS), a key enzyme of sugar metabolism, plays an important role in the regulation of carbon partitioning in plant, and affects important agronomic traits and abiotic responses to adversity. However, the function of ZmSUS1 in plant drought tolerance is still unknown. In this study, the expression patterns of ZmSUS1 in different tissues and under drought stress were analyzed in maize (Zea mays L.). It was found that ZmSUS1 was highly expressed during kernel development but also in leaves and roots of maize, and ZmSUS1 was induced by drought stress. Homozygous transgenic maize lines overexpressing ZmSUS1 increased the content and activity of SUS under drought stress and exhibited higher relative water content, proline and abscisic acid content in leaves. Specifically, the net photosynthetic rate and the soluble sugar contents including sucrose, glucose, fructose and SUS decomposition products including UDP-glucose (UDP-G) and ADP-glucose (ADP-G) in transgenic plants were significantly improved after drought stress. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpressing of ZmSUS1 mainly affected the expression level of carbon metabolism-related genes. Especially the expression level of sucrose metabolism-related genes including sucrose phosphatase gene (SPP), sucrose phosphate synthase gene (SPS) and invertase gene (INV) were significantly up-regulated in transgenic maize. Overall, these results suggested that ZmSUS1 improved drought tolerance by regulating sucrose metabolism and increasing the soluble sugar content, and endowing transgenic maize with higher relative water content and photosynthesis levels, which can serve as a new gene candidate for cultivating drought-resistant maize varieties."
38281155,response to Puccinia sorghi,Application of a U-Net Neural Network to the Puccinia sorghi-Maize Pathosystem.,"Phenotyping in phytopathology has become a critical area of research, particularly as pathogen distribution changes and the ability to overcome both innate resistance and control methods develop among pathogen populations. Computer vision approaches to analyze plant disease data can be both faster and more reliable than traditional, manual approaches. However, the requirement of manually annotating training data for the majority of machine learning applications can present a challenge for pipeline development. Here, we describe a machine learning approach to quantify Puccinia sorghi incidence on maize leaves utilizing U-Net convolutional neural network models. We analyze several U-Net models with increasing amounts of training image data, either randomly chosen from a large data pool, or randomly chosen from a subset of disease time course data. As training dataset size increases, models perform better, but the rate of performance decreases. Additionally, the use of a diverse training dataset can improve model performance and reduce the amount of annotated training data required for satisfactory performance. Models with as few as 48 training images are able to replicate the ground truth results within our testing dataset. The final model utilizing our entire training dataset performs similarly to our ground truth data, with an intersection over union value of 0.5002 and an F1 score of 0.6669. This work illustrates the capacity of U-Nets to accurately answer real world plant pathology questions related to quantification and estimation of plant disease symptoms."
38281646,response to humic acid,Photosynthesis promotion mechanisms of artificial humic acid depend on plant types: A hydroponic study on C3 and C4 plants.,"It is feasible to improve plant photosynthesis to address the global climate goals of carbon neutrality. The application of artificial humic acid (AHA) is a promising approach to promote plant photosynthesis, however, the associated mechanisms for C3 and C4 plants are still unclear. In this study, the real-time chlorophyll synthesis and microscopic physiological changes in plant leave cells with the application of AHA were first revealed using the real-time chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and Non-invasive Micro-test Technique. The transcriptomics suggested that the AHA application up-regulated the genes in photosynthesis, especially related to chlorophyll synthesis and light energy capture, in maize and the genes in photosynthetic vitality and carbohydrate metabolic process in lettuce. Structural equation model suggested that the photodegradable substances and growth hormones in AHA directly contributes to photosynthesis of C4 plants (0.37). AHA indirectly promotes the photosynthesis in the C4 plants by upregulating functional genes (e.g., Mg-CHLI and Chlorophyllase) involved in light capture and transformation (0.96). In contrast, AHA mainly indirectly promotes C3 plants photosynthesis by increasing chlorophyll synthesis, and the Rubisco activity and the ZmRbcS expression in the dark reaction of lettuce (0.55). In addition, Mg2+ transfer and flux in C3 plant leaves was significantly improved by AHA, indirectly contributes to plant photosynthesis (0.24). Finally, the AHA increased the net photosynthetic rate of maize by 46.50 % and that of lettuce by 88.00 %. Application of the nutrients- and hormone-rich AHA improves plant growth and photosynthesis even better than traditional Hoagland solution. The revelation of the different photosynthetic promotion mechanisms on C3 and C4 plant in this work guides the synthesis and efficient application of AHA in green agriculture and will propose the development of AHA technology to against climate change resulting from CO2 emissions in near future."
38285217,response to salt,Calcineurin B-like protein ZmCBL8-1 promotes salt stress resistance in Arabidopsis.,"ZmCBL8-1 enhances salt stress tolerance in maize by improving the antioxidant system to neutralize ROS homeostasis and inducing Na+/H+ antiporter gene expressions of leaves. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) as plant-specific calcium sensors have been explored for their roles in the regulation of abiotic stress tolerance. Further, the functional variations in ZmCBL8, encoding a component of the salt overly sensitive pathway, conferred the salt stress tolerance in maize. ZmCBL8-1 is a transcript of ZmCBL8 found in maize, but its function in the salt stress response is still unclear. The present study aimed to characterize the protein ZmCBL8-1 that was determined to be composed of 194 amino acids (aa) with three conserved EF hands responsible for binding Ca2+. However, a 20-aa fragment was found to be missing from its C-terminus relative to another transcript of ZmCBL8. Results indicated that it harbored a dual-lipid modification motif MGCXXS at its N-terminus and was located on the cell membrane. The accumulation of ZmCBL8-1 transcripts was high in the roots but relatively lower in the leaves of maize under normal condition. In contrast, its expression was significantly decreased in the roots, while increased in the leaves under NaCl treatment. The overexpression of ZmCBL8-1 resulted in higher salt stress resistance of transgenic Arabidopsis in a Ca2+-dependent manner relative to that of the wild type (WT). In ZmCBL8-1-overexpressing plants exposed to NaCl, the contents of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide were decreased in comparison with those in the WT, and the expression of key genes involved in the antioxidant defense system and Na+/H+ antiporter were upregulated. These results suggested that ZmCBL8-1 played a positive role in the response of leaves to salt stress by inducing the expression of Na+/H+ antiporter genes and enhancing the antioxidant system to neutralize the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. These observations further indicate that ZmCBL8-1 confers salt stress tolerance, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of the ZmCBL8 gene is important for salt tolerance."
38288407,root morphology,Topological data analysis expands the genotype to phenotype map for 3D maize root system architecture.,"A central goal of biology is to understand how genetic variation produces phenotypic variation, which has been described as a genotype to phenotype (G to P) map. The plant form is continuously shaped by intrinsic developmental and extrinsic environmental inputs, and therefore plant phenomes are highly multivariate and require comprehensive approaches to fully quantify. Yet a common assumption in plant phenotyping efforts is that a few pre-selected measurements can adequately describe the relevant phenome space. Our poor understanding of the genetic basis of root system architecture is at least partially a result of this incongruence. Root systems are complex 3D structures that are most often studied as 2D representations measured with relatively simple univariate traits. In prior work, we showed that persistent homology, a topological data analysis method that does not pre-suppose the salient features of the data, could expand the phenotypic trait space and identify new G to P relations from a commonly used 2D root phenotyping platform. Here we extend the work to entire 3D root system architectures of maize seedlings from a mapping population that was designed to understand the genetic basis of maize-nitrogen relations. Using a panel of 84 univariate traits, persistent homology methods developed for 3D branching, and multivariate vectors of the collective trait space, we found that each method captures distinct information about root system variation as evidenced by the majority of non-overlapping QTL, and hence that root phenotypic trait space is not easily exhausted. The work offers a data-driven method for assessing 3D root structure and highlights the importance of non-canonical phenotypes for more accurate representations of the G to P map."
38292308,stalk lodging,Biomechanical phenotyping pipeline for stalk lodging resistance in maize.,"Stalk lodging (structural failure crops prior to harvest) significantly reduces annual yields of vital grain crops. The lack of standardized, high throughput phenotyping methods capable of quantifying biomechanical plant traits prevents comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of stalk lodging resistance. A phenotyping pipeline developed to enable higher throughput biomechanical measurements of plant traits related to stalk lodging is presented. The methods were developed using principles from the fields of engineering mechanics and metrology and they enable retention of plant-specific data instead of averaging data across plots as is typical in most phenotyping studies. This pipeline was specifically designed to be implemented in large experimental studies and has been used to phenotype over 40,000 maize stalks. The pipeline includes both lab- and field-based phenotyping methodologies and enables the collection of metadata. Best practices learned by implementing this pipeline over the past three years are presented. The specific instruments (including model numbers and manufacturers) that work well for these methods are presented, however comparable instruments may be used in conjunction with these methods as seen fit. 
•Efficient methods to measure biomechanical traits and record metadata related to stalk lodging. 
•Can be used in studies with large sample sizes (i.e., > 1,000)."
38293619,response to nicosulfuron,Distinctive physiological and molecular responses of foxtail millet and maize to nicosulfuron.,"Introduction: Nicosulfuron is the leading acetolactate synthase inhibitor herbicide product, and widely used to control gramineous weeds. Here, we investigated the metabolic process of nicosulfuron into foxtail millet and maize, in order to clarify the mechanism of the difference in sensitivity of foxtail millet and maize to nicosulfuron from the perspective of physiological metabolism and provide a theoretical basis for the breeding of nicosulfuron-resistant foxtail millet varieties. 

Methods: We treated foxtail millet (Zhangzagu 10, Jingu 21) and maize (Nongda 108, Ditian 8) with various doses of nicosulfuron in both pot and field experiments. The malonaldehyde (MDA) content, target enzymes, detoxification enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes, as well as related gene expression levels in the leaf tissues of foxtail millet and maize were measured, and the yield was determined after maturity. 

Results: The results showed that the recommended dose of nicosulfuron caused Zhangzagu 10 and Jingu 21 to fail to harvest; the yield of the sensitive maize variety (Ditian 8) decreased by 37.09%, whereas that of the resistant maize variety (Nongda 108) did not decrease. Nicosulfuron stress increased the CYP450 enzyme activity, MDA content, and antioxidant enzyme activity of foxtail millet and maize, reduced the acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity and ALS gene expression of foxtail millet and Ditian 8, and reduced the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and GST gene expression of foxtail millet. In conclusion, target enzymes, detoxification enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes were involved in the detoxification metabolism of nicosulfuron in plants. ALS and GST are the main factors responsible for the metabolic differences among foxtail millet, sensitive maize varieties, and resistant maize varieties. 

Discussion: These findings offer valuable insights for exploring the target resistance (TSR) and non-target resistance (NTSR) mechanisms in foxtail millet under herbicide stress and provides theoretical basis for future research of develop foxtail millet germplasm with diverse herbicide resistance traits."
38300347,response to Rhizoctonia solani,The F-box protein ZmFBL41 negatively regulates disease resistance to Rhizoctonia solani by degrading the abscisic acid synthase ZmNCED6 in maize.,"The maize F-box protein ZmFBL41 targets abscisic acid synthase 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 6 for degradation, and this regulatory module is exploited by Rhizoctonia solani to promote infection. F-box proteins are crucial regulators of plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Previous research identified the F-box gene ZmFBL41 as a negative regulator of maize (Zea mays) defenses against Rhizoctonia solani. However, the precise mechanisms by which F-box proteins mediate resistance to R. solani remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that ZmFBL41 interacts with an abscisic acid (ABA) synthase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 6 (ZmNCED6), promoting its degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. We discovered that the ectopic overexpression of ZmNCED6 in rice (Oryza sativa) inhibited R. solani infection by activating stomatal closure, callose deposition, and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, indicating that ZmNCED6 enhances plant immunity against R. solani. Natural variation at ZmFBL41 across different maize haplotypes did not affect the ZmFBL41-ZmNCED6 interaction. These findings suggest that ZmFBL41 targets ZmNCED6 for degradation, leading to a decrease in ABA levels in maize, in turn, inhibiting ABA-mediated disease resistance pathways, such as stomatal closure, callose deposition, and JA biosynthesis, ultimately facilitating R. solani infection."
38302871,Abiotic stress response,Genome-wide identification and transcriptome profiling expression analysis of the U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase gene family related to abiotic stress in maize (Zea mays L.),"Background: The U-box gene family encodes E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in plant hormone signaling pathways and abiotic stress responses. However, there has yet to be a comprehensive analysis of the U-box gene family in maize (Zea mays L.) and its responses to abiotic stress. 
Results: In this study, 85 U-box family proteins were identified in maize and were classified into four subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. In addition to the conserved U-box domain, we identified additional functional domains, including Pkinase, ARM, KAP and Tyr domains, by analyzing the conserved motifs and gene structures. Chromosomal localization and collinearity analysis revealed that gene duplications may have contributed to the expansion and evolution of the U-box gene family. GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified a total of 105 GO terms and 21 KEGG pathways that were notably enriched, including ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. Tissue expression analysis showed that some ZmPUB genes were specifically expressed in certain tissues and that this could be due to their functions. In addition, RNA-seq data for maize seedlings under salt stress revealed 16 stress-inducible plant U-box genes, of which 10 genes were upregulated and 6 genes were downregulated. The qRT-PCR results for genes responding to abiotic stress were consistent with the transcriptome analysis. Among them, ZmPUB13, ZmPUB18, ZmPUB19 and ZmPUB68 were upregulated under all three abiotic stress conditions. Subcellular localization analysis showed that ZmPUB19 and ZmPUB59 were located in the nucleus. 
Conclusions: Overall, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the U-box gene family in maize and its responses to abiotic stress, suggesting that U-box genes play an important role in the stress response and providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the response to abiotic stress in maize."
38305579,stomatal conductance,Stomatal conductance reduction tradeoffs in maize leaves: A theoretical study.,"As the leading global grain crop, maize significantly impacts agricultural water usage.
Presently, photosynthesis (Anet) in leaves of modern maize crops is saturated with
CO2, implying that reducing stomatal conductance (gs) would not affect Anet but
reduce transpiration (τ), thereby increasing water use efficiency (WUE). While gs
reduction benefits upper canopy leaves under optimal conditions, the tradeoffs in
low light and nitrogen‐deficient leaves under nonoptimal microenvironments remain
unexplored. Moreover, gs reduction increases leaf temperature (Tleaf) and water
vapor pressure deficit, partially counteracting transpiratory water savings. There-
fore, the overall impact of gs reduction on water savings remains unclear. Here, we
use a process‐based leaf model to investigate the benefits of reduced gs in maize
leaves under different microenvironments. Our findings show that increases in Tleaf
due to gs reduction can diminish WUE gains by up to 20%. However, gs reduction
still results in beneficial WUE tradeoffs, where a 29% decrease in gs in upper canopy
leaves results in a 28% WUE gain without loss in Anet. Lower canopy leaves exhibit
superior tradeoffs in gs reduction with 178% gains in WUE without loss in Anet. Our
simulations show that these WUE benefits are resilient to climate chang"
38315718,response to low phosphorus,ZmARF1 positively regulates low phosphorus stress tolerance via modulating lateral root development in maize,"Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the most critical factors for plant growth and productivity, including its inhibition of lateral root initiation. Auxin response factors (ARFs) play crucial roles in root development via auxin signaling mediated by genetic pathways. In this study, we found that the transcription factor ZmARF1 was associated with low inorganic phosphate (Pi) stress-related traits in maize. This superior root morphology and greater phosphate stress tolerance could be ascribed to the overexpression of ZmARF1. The knock out mutant zmarf1 had shorter primary roots, fewer root tip number, and lower root volume and surface area. Transcriptomic data indicate that ZmLBD1, a direct downstream target gene, is involved in lateral root development, which enhances phosphate starvation tolerance. A transcriptional activation assay revealed that ZmARF1 specifically binds to the GC-box motif in the promoter of ZmLBD1 and activates its expression. Moreover, ZmARF1 positively regulates the expression of ZmPHR1, ZmPHT1;2, and ZmPHO2, which are key transporters of Pi in maize. We propose that ZmARF1 promotes the transcription of ZmLBD1 to modulate lateral root development and Pi-starvation induced (PSI) genes to regulate phosphate mobilization and homeostasis under phosphorus starvation. In addition, ZmERF2 specifically binds to the ABRE motif of the promoter of ZmARF1 and represses its expression. Collectively, the findings of this study revealed that ZmARF1 is a pivotal factor that modulates root development and confers low-Pi stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of the biological function of ZmLBD1 and the expression of key Pi transport proteins. 
Author summary: Phosphorus (P) is a critical macronutrient for plant growth and development. Root system architecture (RSA) affects the ability of plants to obtain water and mineral nutrients from soil. Several auxin response factors (ARFs) are involved in auxin signaling and lateral root (LR) formation in P-deficient plants, but the molecular mechanisms underlying P deficiency-induced changes in the RSA of maize is not well understood. We found that ZmARF1 positively regulates root development and confers tolerance to low inorganic phosphate (Pi) stress in maize. ZmARF1 regulates root development by interacting with the promoter of ZmLBD1 and positively regulating its expression. Furthermore, we empirically revealed that ZmARF1 enhanced Pi mobilization under low Pi stress by positively regulating the expression of ZmPHR1, ZmPHT1;2, and ZmPHO2, which are key Pi transporters in the Pi transport machinery of maize. Overall, enhanced root development and expression of key Pi transporter proteins have been suggested as key nexuses mediating the biological function of ZmARF1 in conferring low-Pi stress tolerance in maize."
38317308,cell wall carbohydrate content; stalk lodging,Diverging cell wall strategies for drought adaptation in two maize inbreds with contrasting lodging resistance,"The plant cell wall is a plastic structure of variable composition that constitutes the first line of defence against environmental challenges. Lodging and drought are two stressful conditions that severely impact maize yield. In a previous work, we characterised the cell walls of two maize inbreds, EA2024 (susceptible) and B73 (resistant) to stalk lodging. Here, we show that drought induces distinct phenotypical, physiological, cell wall, and transcriptional changes in the two inbreds, with B73 exhibiting lower tolerance to this stress than EA2024. In control conditions, EA2024 stalks had higher levels of cellulose, uronic acids and p-coumarate than B73. However, upon drought EA2024 displayed increased levels of arabinose-enriched polymers, such as pectin-arabinans and arabinogalactan proteins, and a decreased lignin content. By contrast, B73 displayed a deeper rearrangement of cell walls upon drought, including modifications in lignin composition (increased S subunits and S/G ratio; decreased H subunits) and an increase of uronic acids. Drought induced more substantial changes in gene expression in B73 compared to EA2024, particularly in cell wall-related genes, that were modulated in an inbred-specific manner. Transcription factor enrichment assays unveiled inbred-specific regulatory networks coordinating cell wall genes expression. Altogether, these findings reveal that B73 and EA2024 inbreds, with opposite stalk-lodging phenotypes, undertake different cell wall modification strategies in response to drought. We propose that the specific cell wall composition conferring lodging resistance to B73, compromises its cell wall plasticity, and renders this inbred more susceptible to drought."
38332029,germination index,The germination response of Zea mays L. to osmotic potentials across optimal temperatures via halo-thermal time model.,"The maize (Zea mays L.) is a monocot that is a member of the Poaceae family and a valuable feed for livestock, human food, and raw material for various industries. The halothermal time model determines how plants respond to salt (NaCl) stress under sub-optimal conditions. This model examines the relation between NaClb (g), GR, GP, salinity and temperature stress on germination of seeds dynamics in various crops. Five constant temperatures i.e. 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C and five ψ levels (NaCl concentrations converted to ψ - 0, - 0.2, - 0.4, - 0.6, and - 0.8 MPa) were used in this experiment. In light of the results, the maximum halo-thermal time constant value was recorded at 35 °C temperature, while maximum germination percentage was detected at 30 °C in the controlled condition. Moreover, the lowermost value was recorded at 20 °C at - 0.8 MPa osmotic potential. The highest CAT, APX, and GPX activities were recorded at 15 °C at - 0.8 MPa, while the lowest values were observed for 0 MPa at 30 °C temperature. In conclusion, by employing the halo thermal time model, the germination of maize variety (var.30W52) was accurately predicted for the first time under varying levels of temperature and osmotic potentials."
38334939,Anthocyanin content,Backcrossing Modulates the Metabolic Profiles of Anthocyanin-Pigmented 'Vitamaize' Lines Derived from Elite Maize Lines.,"Vitamaize lines (VMLs) were created by backcrossing the pigmented aleurone trait into Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT) maize lines (CMLs). This study evaluates metabolic differences between the VMLs and their original CMLs. Direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) analyses, carotenoid profiling, total anthocyanins content (TAC) determination, and biochemical evaluation of the quality protein maize (QPM) endosperm trait allowed a comprehensive chemical characterization of the maize lines. DIMS data indicate higher hexoses and trigonelline content for most VMLs; the carotenoid profile revealed a decrease in β-cryptoxanthin to less than half of the original parent content for two VMLs but an augmentation for one VML. The pigmented aleurone VMLs did not inherit the complex QPM endosperm trait of the QPM CMLs. Except for anthocyanin accumulation, no other metabolites were consistently modified across all the backcross-generated maize lines with a pigmented aleurone trait. These findings suggest using genetic or metabolic markers rather than morphological or visual traits for future breeding programs."
38339032,tassel weight,Genome-Wide Association Study and Prediction of Tassel Weight of Tropical Maize Germplasm in Multi-Parent Population,"Tassel weight (TW) is a crucial agronomic trait that significantly affects pollen supply and grain yield development in maize breeding. To improve maize yield and develop new varieties, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying tassel weight is essential. In this study, tropical maize inbred lines, namely CML312, CML373, CML444, and YML46, were selected as female parents and crossed with the elite maize inbred line Ye107, which served as the common male parent, to develop a multi-parent population comprising four F8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) subpopulations. Using 6616 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we conducted genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) on 642 F8 RILs in four subpopulations across three different environments. Through GWAS, we identified 16 SNPs that were significantly associated with TW, encompassing two stable loci expressed across multiple environments. Furthermore, within the candidate regions of these SNPs, we discovered four novel candidate genes related to TW, namely Zm00001d044362, Zm00001d011048, Zm00001d011049, and Zm00001d031173 distributed on chromosomes 1, 3, and 8, which have not been previously reported. These genes are involved in processes such as signal transduction, growth and development, protein splicing, and pollen development, all of which play crucial roles in inflorescence meristem development, directly affecting TW. The co-localized SNP, S8_137379725, on chromosome 8 was situated within a 16.569 kb long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT), located 22.819 kb upstream and 26.428 kb downstream of the candidate genes (Zm00001d011048 and Zm00001d011049). When comparing three distinct GS models, the BayesB model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting TW. This study establishes the theoretical foundation for future research into the genetic mechanisms underlying maize TW and the efficient breeding of high-yielding varieties with desired tassel weight through GS."
38339894,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,"The C4 photosynthesis bifunctional enzymes, PDRPs, of maize are co-opted to cytoplasmic viral replication complexes to promote infection of a prevalent potyvirus sugarcane mosaic virus.","In maize, two pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) regulatory proteins, ZmPDRP1 and ZmPDRP2, are respectively specific to the chloroplast of mesophyll cells (MCs) and bundle sheath cells (BSCs). Functionally, ZmPDRP1/2 catalyse both phosphorylation/inactivation and dephosphorylation/activation of ZmPPDK, which is implicated as a major rate-limiting enzyme in C4 photosynthesis of maize. Our study here showed that maize plants lacking ZmPDRP1 or silencing of ZmPDRP1/2 confer resistance to a prevalent potyvirus sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). We verified that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of ZmPDRP1 plays a key role in promoting viral infection while independent of enzyme activity. Intriguingly, ZmPDRP1 and ZmPDRP2 re-localize to cytoplasmic viral replication complexes (VRCs) following SCMV infection. We identified that SCMV-encoded cytoplasmic inclusions protein CI targets directly ZmPDRP1 or ZmPDRP2 or their CTDs, leading to their re-localization to cytoplasmic VRCs. Moreover, we found that CI could be degraded by the 26S proteasome system, while ZmPDRP1 and ZmPDRP2 could up-regulate the accumulation level of CI through their CTDs by a yet unknown mechanism. Most importantly, with genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches, we provide evidence that BSCs-specific ZmPDRP2 could accumulate in MCs of Zmpdrp1 knockout (KO) lines, revealing a unique regulatory mechanism crossing different cell types to maintain balanced ZmPPDK phosphorylation, thereby to keep maize normal growth. Together, our findings uncover the genetic link of the two cell-specific maize PDRPs, both of which are co-opted to VRCs to promote viral protein accumulation for robust virus infection."
38348523,Growth and Development,Deciphering temporal growth patterns in maize: integrative modeling of phenotype dynamics and underlying genomic variations.,"Quantifying the temporal or longitudinal growth dynamics of crops in diverse environmental conditions is crucial for understanding plant development, requiring further modeling techniques. In this study, we analyzed the growth patterns of two different maize (Zea mays L.) populations using high-throughput phenotyping with a maize population consisting of 515 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) grown in Texas and a hybrid population containing 1090 hybrids grown in Missouri. Two models, Gaussian peak and functional principal component analysis (FPCA), were employed to study the Normalized Green-Red Difference Index (NGRDI) scores. The Gaussian peak model showed strong correlations (c. 0.94 for RILs and c. 0.97 for hybrids) between modeled and non-modeled temporal trajectories. Functional principal component analysis differentiated NGRDI trajectories in RILs under different conditions, capturing substantial variability (75%, 20%, and 5% for RILs; 88% and 12% for hybrids). By comparing these models with conventional BLUP values, common quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, containing candidate genes of brd1, pin11, zcn8 and rap2. The harmony between these loci's additive effects and growing degree days, as well as the differentiation of RIL haplotypes across growth stages, underscores the significant interplay of these loci in driving plant development. These findings contribute to advancing understanding of plant-environment interactions and have implications for crop improvement strategies."
38366643,response to heat stress,Heat stress at the bicellular stage inhibits sperm cell development and transport into pollen tubes,"For successful double fertilization in flowering plants (angiosperms), pollen tubes deliver two non-motile sperm cells towards female gametes (egg and central cell, respectively). Heatwaves, especially during the reproduction period, threaten male gametophyte (pollen) development, resulting in severe yield losses. Using maize (Zea mays) as a crop and grass model system, we found strong seed set reduction when moderate heat stress was applied for two days during the uni- and bicellular stages of pollen development. We show that heat stress accelerates pollen development and impairs pollen germination capabilities when applied at the unicellular stage. Heat stress at the bicellular stage impairs sperm cell development and transport into pollen tubes. To understand the course of the latter defects, we used marker lines and analyzed the transcriptomes of isolated sperm cells. Heat stress affected the expression of genes associated with transcription, RNA processing and translation, DNA replication, and the cell cycle. This included the genes encoding centromeric histone 3 (CENH3) and α-tubulin. Most genes that were mis-regulated encode proteins involved in the transition from metaphase to anaphase during pollen mitosis II (PM II). Heat stress also activated spindle assembly check point and meta- to anaphase transition genes in sperm cells. In summary, mis-regulation of the identified genes during heat stress at the bicellular stage results in sperm cell development and transport defects ultimately leading to sterility."
38366721,response to flooding,Comparative analysis of defensive secondary metabolites in wild teosinte and cultivated maize under flooding and herbivory stress.,"Climate change is driving an alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of abiotic and biotic stress factors, negatively impacting plant development and agricultural productivity. To survive, plants respond by inducing changes in below and aboveground metabolism with concomitant alterations in defensive secondary metabolites. While plant responses to the isolated stresses of flooding and insect herbivory have been extensively studied, much less is known about their response in combination. Wild relatives of cultivated plants with robust stress tolerance traits provide an excellent system for comparing how diverse plant species respond to combinatorial stress, and provide insight into potential germplasms for stress-tolerant hybrids. In this study, we compared the below and aboveground changes in the secondary metabolites of maize (Zea mays) and a flood-tolerant wild relative Nicaraguan teosinte (Zea nicaraguensis) in response to flooding, insect herbivory, and their combination. Root tissue was analyzed for changes in belowground metabolism. Leaf total phenolic content and headspace volatile organic compound emission were analyzed for changes in aboveground secondary metabolism. Results revealed significant differences in the root metabolome profiles of teosinte and maize. Notably, the accumulation of the flavonoids apigenin, naringenin, and luteolin during flooding and herbivory differentiated teosinte from maize. Aboveground, terpenes, including trans-α-bergamotene and (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene, shaped compositional differences in their volatile profiles between flooding, herbivory, and their combination. Taken together, these results suggest teosinte may be more tolerant than maize due to dynamic metabolic changes during flooding and herbivory that help relieve stress and influence plant-insect interactions."
38370253,seedling emergence,Comparative regulatory network of transcripts behind radicle emergence and seedling stage of maize (Zea mays L.).,"The transition from radicle emergence to seedling growth in maize is a crucial phase in the plant's life cycle, where rapid physiological and biochemical changes occur to facilitate successful development. In this study, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular processes driving this critical transition. The early divergence in gene expression patterns highlighted the upregulation of a substantial number of genes during radicle emergence. During radicle emergence, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis unveiled active participation in biological processes such as chromatin assembly, cellular response to abiotic stress, and hormone signaling. This indicates that the initial stages of growth are marked by cellular expansion and adaptation to environmental stimuli. Conversely, in the seedling growth stage, GO analysis demonstrated a shift toward processes such as photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, reflecting a transition to energy production and enhanced growth. In contrast, seedling growth was characterized by pathways related to photosynthesis and the production of gibberellins, crucial for robust seedling development. Hormonal regulation and starch metabolism were also prominent during radicle emergence, with various hormones, including auxins, diterpenoids, and brassinosteroids, driving processes like cell enlargement and stem growth. Moreover, starch and sucrose metabolism genes were expressed to mobilize stored reserves for energy during this stage. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic regulation of genes and pathways during this critical phase of maize development."
38384753,response to heat stress,A SLAF-based high-density genetic map construction and genetic architecture of thermotolerant traits in maize (Zea mays L.).,"The leaf scorching trait at flowering is a crucial thermosensitive phenotype in maize under high temperature stress (HS), yet the genetic basis of this trait remains poorly understood. In this study, we genotyped a 254 RIL-F2:8 population, derived from the leaf scorch-free parental inbred line Abe2 and the leaf scorching maternal inbred line B73, using the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method. A total of 10,112 polymorphic SLAF markers were developed, and a high-density genetic map with a total length of 1,475.88 cM was constructed. The average sequencing depth of the parents was 55.23X, and that of the progeny was 12.53X. Then, we identified a total of 16 QTLs associated with thermotolerant traits at flowering, of which four QTLs of leaf scorching damage (LS) were distributed on chromosomes 1 (qLS1), 2 (qLS2.1, qLS2.2) and 3 (qLS3), which could explain 19.73% of phenotypic variation. Combining one qLS1 locus with QTL-seq results led to the identification of 6 candidate genes. Expression experiments and sequence variation indicated that Zm00001d033328, encoding N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase, was the most likely candidate gene controlling thermotolerant traits at flowering. In summary, the high-density genetic map and genetic basis of thermotolerant traits lay a critical foundation for mapping other complex traits and identifying the genes associated with thermotolerant traits in maize."
38385996,animal response,High-resolution kinetics of herbivore-induced plant volatile transfer reveal clocked response patterns in neighboring plants.,"Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants (senders) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants (receivers), however, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.Most plants are anchored to the soil by roots and need to be able to defend themselves from insects and other animal pests while remaining stationary. One way plants achieve this is to emit chemicals known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) into the air when they are under attack to attract other animals that are natural enemies of the pest. Certain HIPVs also prime other nearby plants (known as ‘receivers’) to be ready for an attack, or even pre-emptively activate defense responses in the plant before they encounter the pest. However, it remains unclear how the temporal patterns of HIPVs emitted from attacked plants affect how receiver plants respond to these chemicals, and how day-to-night light fluctuations impact this transfer of chemical information. To investigate this question, Waterman et al. exposed maize plants to a common pest caterpillar called Spodoptera exigua. Individual infested maize plants (referred to as ‘senders’) were placed in transparent glass chambers that were linked by a narrow tube to a second glass chamber containing a receiver plant that had not encountered caterpillars. The team used a mass spectrometry approach to measure the HIPVs emitted by the sender plants and the responses of the receivers in real-time. The experiments found that within the first few hours of exposure to HIPVs, receiver plants had a small burst of defense activity that was followed by a far stronger burst several hours later. The second burst coincided with the accumulation of plant hormones called jasmonates in the receiver plants, and was not controlled by fluctuations in light levels. This suggests that HIPVs first prime and then subsequently induce defense responses in other plants in a manner that is independent of the patterns of day and night. In the future, these findings may be used to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of pest outbreaks in crop fields. They will also help us to better understand how plants communicate and the impact of this communication on their environment."
38393826,response to low phosphorus,ZmNF-YC1-ZmAPRG pathway modulates low phosphorus tolerance in maize,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and yield. Low phosphate-use-efficiency makes it important to clarify the molecular mechanism of low phosphorus stress. In our previous studies, a phosphorus efficiency gene ZmAPRG was identified. Here, we further screened the upstream regulator ZmNF-YC1 of ZmAPRG by yeast one hybrid (Y1H) assay, and found it was a low Pi-inducible gene. The results of dual luciferase assays, expression analysis and ChIP-qPCR assays showed that ZmNF-YC1 is a positive regulator of ZmAPRG. Overexpression of ZmNF-YC1 improved low phosphorus tolerance whereas knockout of ZmNF-YC1 decreased low phosphorus tolerance in maize. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), Y2H and Y3H assay further showed that ZmNF-YC1 can interact with ZmNF-YB14, and recruit ZmNF-YA4/10 to form NF-Y complexes. Transcriptional activation assay confirmed that the NF-Y complexes can activate the promoters of ZmAPRG. Meanwhile, transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicated that overexpression of ZmAPRG improves low P tolerance by regulating lipid composition and photosynthetic capacity, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters supplied evidence in support of this hypothesis. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmAPRG increased grain yield in inbred and hybrid maize under low P conditions. Taken together, our research revealed the low P tolerance mechanism of ZmNF-YC1-ZmAPRG pathway."
38408034,response to maize lethal necrosis; response to maize chlorotic mottle virus; response to potyirus,Effects of Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus and Potyvirus Resistance on Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease.,"Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is a viral disease caused by host co-infection by maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a potyvirus, such as sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). The disease is most effectively managed by growing MLN-resistant varieties. However, the relative importance of MCMV and potyvirus resistance in managing this synergistic disease is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SCMV and/or MCMV resistance on disease, virus titers, and synergism and explored expression patterns of known potyvirus resistance genes TrxH and ABP1. MLN disease was significantly lower in both the MCMV-resistant and SCMV-resistant inbred lines compared with the susceptible control Oh28. Prior to 14 days postinoculation (dpi), MCMV titers in resistant lines N211 and KS23-6 were more than 100,000-fold lower than found in the susceptible Oh28. However, despite no visible symptoms, titer differences between MCMV-resistant and -susceptible lines were negligible by 14 dpi. In contrast, systemic SCMV titers in the potyvirus-resistant line, Pa405, ranged from 130,000-fold to 2 million-fold lower than susceptible Oh28 as disease progressed. Initial TrxH expression was up to 49,000-fold lower in Oh28 compared with other genotypes, whereas expression of ABP1 was up to 4.5-fold lower. Measures of virus synergy indicate that whereas MCMV resistance is effective in early infection, strong potyvirus resistance is critical for reducing synergist effects of co-infection on MCMV titer. These results emphasize the importance of both potyvirus resistance and MCMV resistance in an effective breeding program for MLN management."
38427606,response to Meloidogyne incognita,A QTL on Maize Chromosome 5 is Associated with Root-Knot Nematode Resistance.,"This study provides the first report of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in maize (Zea mays) for resistance to the southern root-knot nematode (SRKN) (Meloidogyne incognita). The SRKN can feed on the roots of maize in the U.S. Southern Coastal Plain region and can cause yield losses of 30% or greater in heavily infested fields. Increases in SRKN density in the soil may reduce the yield for subsequently planted susceptible crops. The use of maize hybrids with resistance to SRKN could prevent an increase in SRKN density, yet no genetic regions have been identified that confer host resistance. In this study, a B73 (susceptible) x Ky21 (resistant) S5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was phenotyped for total number of eggs (TE) and root weight. This population has been previously genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By utilizing the SNP data with the phenotype data, a single QTL was identified on chromosome 5 that explained 15% of the phenotypic variation (PV) for the number of eggs and 11% of the PV for the number of eggs per g of root (EGR). Plants that were homozygous for the Ky21 allele for the most associated marker PZA03172.3 had fewer eggs and fewer EGR than the plants that were homozygous or heterozygous for the B73 allele. Thus, the first QTL for SRKN resistance in maize has been identified and could be incorporated into maize hybrids."
38427914,carotenoid content,Investigating genomic prediction strategies for grain carotenoid traits in a tropical/subtropical maize panel.,"Vitamin A deficiency remains prevalent on a global scale, including in regions where maize constitutes a high percentage of human diets. One solution for alleviating this deficiency has been to increase grain concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.)-an example of biofortification. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) developed a Carotenoid Association Mapping panel of 380 inbred lines adapted to tropical and subtropical environments that have varying grain concentrations of provitamin A and other health-beneficial carotenoids. Several major genes have been identified for these traits, two of which have particularly been leveraged in marker-assisted selection. This project assesses the predictive ability of several genomic prediction (GP) strategies for maize grain carotenoid traits within and between four environments in Mexico. Ridge Regression-Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, Elastic Net, and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces had high predictive abilities for all tested traits (β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, provitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin) and outperformed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Furthermore, predictive abilities were higher when using genome-wide markers rather than only the markers proximal to two or 13 genes. These findings suggest that GP models using genome-wide markers (and assuming equal variance of marker effects) are worthwhile for these traits even though key genes have already been identified, especially if breeding for additional grain carotenoid traits alongside β-carotene. Predictive ability was maintained for all traits except lutein in between-environment prediction. The TASSEL (Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution, and Linkage) Genomic Selection plugin performed as well as other more computationally intensive methods for within-environment prediction. The findings observed herein indicate the utility of GP methods for these traits and could inform their resource-efficient implementation in biofortification breeding programs."
38431291,husk number,Natural polymorphisms in ZMET2 encoding a DNA methyltransferase modulate the number of husk layers in maize.,"DNA methylation affects agronomic traits and the environmental adaptability of crops, but the natural polymorphisms in DNA methylation-related genes and their contributions to phenotypic variation in maize (Zea mays) remain elusive. Here, we show that a polymorphic 10-bp Indel (insertion/deletion) variant in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Zea methyltransferase2 (ZMET2) alters its transcript level and accounts for variation in the number of maize husk layers. ZMET2 encodes a chromomethylase and is required for maintaining genome-wide DNA methylation in the CHG sequence context. Disruption of ZMET2 increased the number of husk layers and resulted in thousands of differentially methylated regions, a proportion of which were also distinguishable in natural ZMET2 alleles. Population genetic analyses indicated that ZMET2 was a target of selection and might play a role in the spread of maize from tropical to temperate regions. Our results provide important insights into the natural variation of ZMET2 that confers both global and locus-specific effects on DNA methylation, which contribute to phenotypic diversity in maize."
38431524,response to Ustilago maydis,Maize requires Arogenate Dehydratase 2 for resistance to Ustilago maydis and plant development.,"Maize (Zea mays) smut is a common biotrophic fungal disease caused by Ustilago maydis and leads to low maize yield. Maize resistance to U. maydis is a quantitative trait. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance of maize to U. maydis is poorly understood. Here, we reported that a maize mutant caused by a single gene mutation exhibited defects in both fungal resistance and plant development. maize mutant highly susceptible to U. maydis (mmsu) with a dwarf phenotype forms tumors in the ear. A map-based cloning and allelism test demonstrated that one gene encoding a putative arogenate dehydratase/prephenate dehydratase (ADT/PDT) is responsible for the phenotypes of the mmsu and was designated as ZmADT2. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that mmsu had substantial differences in multiple metabolic pathways in response to U. maydis infection compared with the wild type. Disruption of ZmADT2 caused damage to the chloroplast ultrastructure and function, metabolic flux redirection, and reduced the amounts of salicylic acid (SA) and lignin, leading to susceptibility to U. maydis and dwarf phenotype. These results suggested that ZmADT2 is required for maintaining metabolic flux, as well as resistance to U. maydis and plant development in maize. Meanwhile, our findings provided insights into the maize response mechanism to U. maydis infection."
38433245,leaf angle,WGCNA analysis of the effect of exogenous BR on leaf angle of maize mutant lpa1,"Leaf angle, as one of the important agronomic traits of maize, can directly affect the planting density of maize, thereby affecting its yield. Here we used the ZmLPA1 gene mutant lpa1 to study maize leaf angle and found that the lpa1 leaf angle changed significantly under exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) treatment compared with WT (inbred line B73). Transcriptome sequencing of WT and lpa1 treated with different concentrations of exogenous BR showed that the differentially expressed genes were upregulated with auxin, cytokinin and brassinosteroid; Genes associated with abscisic acid are down-regulated. The differentially expressed genes in WT and lpa1 by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) yielded two gene modules associated with maize leaf angle change under exogenous BR treatment. The results provide a new theory for the regulation of maize leaf angle by lpa1 and exogenous BR."
38443788,disease response,Epigenetic weapons of plants against fungal pathogens.,"In the natural environment, plants face constant exposure to biotic stress caused by fungal attacks. The plant's response to various biotic stresses relies heavily on its ability to rapidly adjust the transcriptome. External signals are transmitted to the nucleus, leading to activation of transcription factors that subsequently enhance the expression of specific defense-related genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are closely linked to chromatin states, regulate gene expression associated with defense against biotic stress. Additionally, chromatin remodelers and non-coding RNA play a significant role in plant defense against stressors. These molecular modifications enable plants to exhibit enhanced resistance and productivity under diverse environmental conditions. Epigenetic mechanisms also contribute to stress-induced environmental epigenetic memory and priming in plants, enabling them to recall past molecular experiences and utilize this stored information for adaptation to new conditions. In the arms race between fungi and plants, a significant aspect is the cross-kingdom RNAi mechanism, whereby sRNAs can traverse organismal boundaries. Fungi utilize sRNA as an effector molecule to silence plant resistance genes, while plants transport sRNA, primarily through extracellular vesicles, to pathogens in order to suppress virulence-related genes. In this review, we summarize contemporary knowledge on epigenetic mechanisms of plant defense against attack by pathogenic fungi. The role of epigenetic mechanisms during plant-fungus symbiotic interactions is also considered."
38446735,root angle; gravitropism,Ethylene regulates auxin-mediated root gravitropic machinery and controls root angle in cereal crops.,"Root angle is a critical factor in optimising the acquisition of essential resources from different soil depths. The regulation of root angle relies on the auxin-mediated root gravitropism machinery. While the influence of ethylene on auxin levels is known, its specific role in governing root gravitropism and angle remains uncertain, particularly when Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) core ethylene signaling mutants show no gravitropic defects. Our research, focusing on rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays), clearly reveals the involvement of ethylene in root angle regulation in cereal crops through the modulation of auxin biosynthesis and the root gravitropism machinery. We elucidated the molecular components by which ethylene exerts its regulatory effect on auxin biosynthesis to control root gravitropism machinery. The ethylene-insensitive mutants ethylene insensitive2 (osein2) and ethylene insensitive like1 (oseil1), exhibited substantially shallower crown root angle compared to the wild type. Gravitropism assays revealed reduced root gravitropic response in these mutants. Hormone profiling analysis confirmed decreased auxin levels in the root tips of the osein2 mutant, and exogenous auxin (NAA) application rescued root gravitropism in both ethylene-insensitive mutants. Additionally, the auxin-biosynthetic mutant mao hu zi10 (mhz10)/tryptophan aminotransferase2 (ostar2) showed impaired gravitropic response and shallow crown root angle phenotypes. Similarly, maize ethylene-insensitive mutants (zmein2) exhibited defective gravitropism and root angle phenotypes. In conclusion, our study highlights that ethylene controls the auxin-dependent root gravitropism machinery to regulate root angle in rice and maize, revealing a functional divergence in ethylene signaling between Arabidopsis and cereal crops. These findings contribute to a better understanding of root angle regulation and have implications for improving resource acquisition in agricultural systems."
38450401,seed vigor; germination index,An RGB image dataset for seed germination prediction and vigor detection - maize.,"To improve the accuracy of corn seed vigor detection, a new corn seed vigor dataset was created that included a standard germination test under six contrasting conditions. The dataset includes photographs of corn seeds taken at regular intervals and categorized based on their germination status, primary and secondary root growth. The dataset allows researchers to predicting and grading seed germination and vigor, providing a reliable data source for the study of improving corn seed vigor. Additionally, the method of data collection provides a reference for other seed vigor prediction data collection and improves the validity of non-destructive seed vigor identification and testing data in smart agriculture. It also provides a more scientific approach to seed vigor data collection."
38451289,ear morphology,Profiling the selected hotspots for ear traits in two maize–teosinte populations,"Throughout the history of maize cultivation, ear-related traits have been selected. However, little is known about the specific genes involved in shaping these traits from their origins in the wild progenitor, teosinte, to the characteristics observed in modern maize. In this study, five ear traits (kernel row number [KRN], ear length [EL], kernel number per row [KNR], cob diameter [CD], and ear diameter [ED]) were investigated, and eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) hotspots were identified in two maize–teosinte populations. Notably, our findings revealed a significant enrichment of genes showing a selection signature and expressed in the ear in qbdCD1.1, qbdCD5.1, qbpCD2.1, qbdED1.1, qbpEL1.1, qbpEL5.1, qbdKNR1.1, and qbdKNR10.1, suggesting that these eight QTL are selected hotspots involved in shaping the maize ear. By combining the results of the QTL analysis with data from previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving two natural panels, we identified eight candidate selected genes related to KRN, KNR, CD, and ED. Among these, considering their expression pattern and sequence variation, Zm00001d025111, encoding a WD40/YVTN protein, was proposed as a positive regulator of KNR. This study presents a framework for understanding the genomic distribution of selected loci crucial in determining ear-related traits. 
Key message: Eight selected hotspots related to ear traits were identified from two maize–teosinte populations."
38456017,grain quality,Linkage mapping and genomic prediction of grain quality traits in tropical maize (Zea mays L.).,"The suboptimal productivity of maize systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a pressing issue, with far-reaching implications for food security, nutrition, and livelihood sustainability within the affected smallholder farming communities. Dissecting the genetic basis of grain protein, starch and oil content can increase our understanding of the governing genetic systems, improve the efficacy of future breeding schemes and optimize the end-use quality of tropical maize. Here, four bi-parental maize populations were evaluated in field trials in Kenya and genotyped with mid-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Genotypic (G), environmental (E) and G×E variations were found to be significant for all grain quality traits. Broad sense heritabilities exhibited substantial variation (0.18-0.68). Linkage mapping identified multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the studied grain quality traits: 13, 7, 33, 8 and 2 QTLs for oil content, protein content, starch content, grain texture and kernel weight, respectively. The co-localization of QTLs identified in our research suggests the presence of shared genetic factors or pleiotropic effects, implying that specific genomic regions influence the expression of multiple grain quality traits simultaneously. Genomic prediction accuracies were moderate to high for the studied traits. Our findings highlight the polygenic nature of grain quality traits and demonstrate the potential of genomic selection to enhance genetic gains in maize breeding. Furthermore, the identified genomic regions and single nucleotide polymorphism markers can serve as the groundwork for investigating candidate genes that regulate grain quality traits in tropical maize. This, in turn, can facilitate the implementation of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs focused on improving grain nutrient levels."
38457358,kernel weight,"ZmMAPK6, a mitogenactivated protein kinase, regulates maize kernel weight.","Kernel weight is a critical agronomic trait in maize production. Many genes are related to it, but only a few of them have been applied to maize breeding and cultivation. Here, we identify a novel function of maize mitogenactivated protein kinase 6 (ZmMPK6) in the regulation of maize kernel weight. The kernel weight reduced in zmmpk6 mutants, while enhanced in ZmMPK6 overexpression lines. In addition, starch granules, starch content, protein content, and grainfilling characteristics are also affected. ZmMAPK6 is mainly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, widely distributed across various tissues, and expresses during kernel development, which is consistent with its role in kernel weight. Thus, these results denote new insights into the role of ZmMAPK6, a MAPK, in maize kernel weight, and could be applied to further molecular breeding for kernel quality and yield in maize."
38460024,haploid production,Prediction of matrilineal specific patatin-like protein governing in-vivo maternal haploid induction in maize using support vector machine and di-peptide composition.,"The mutant matrilineal (mtl) gene encoding patatin-like phospholipase activity is involved in in-vivo maternal haploid induction in maize. Doubling of chromosomes in haploids by colchicine treatment leads to complete fixation of inbreds in just one generation compared to 6-7 generations of selfing. Thus, knowledge of patatin-like proteins in other crops assumes great significance for in-vivo haploid induction. So far, no online tool is available that can classify unknown proteins into patatin-like proteins. Here, we aimed to optimize a machine learning-based algorithm to predict the patatin-like phospholipase activity of unknown proteins. Four different kernels [radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, polynomial, and linear] were used for building support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using six different sequence-based compositional features (AAC, DPC, GDPC, CTDC, CTDT, and GAAC). A total of 1170 protein sequences including both patatin-like (585 sequences) from various monocots, dicots, and microbes; and non-patatin-like proteins (585 sequences) from different subspecies of Zea mays were analyzed. RBF and polynomial kernels were quite promising in the prediction of patatin-like proteins. Among six sequence-based compositional features, di-peptide composition attained > 90% prediction accuracies using RBF and polynomial kernels. Using mutual information, most explaining dipeptides that contributed the highest to the prediction process were identified. The knowledge generated in this study can be utilized in other crops prior to the initiation of any experiment. The developed SVM model opened a new paradigm for scientists working in in-vivo haploid induction in commercial crops. This is the first report of machine learning of the identification of proteins with patatin-like activity."
38460111,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,Maize catalases are recruited by a virus to modulate viral multiplication and infection.,"Given the detrimental effects of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in plant cells, various antioxidant mechanisms have evolved to maintain cellular redox homeostasis, encompassing both enzymatic components (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic ones. Despite extensive research on the role of antioxidant systems in plant physiology and responses to abiotic stresses, the potential exploitation of antioxidant enzymes by plant viruses to facilitate viral infection remains insufficiently addressed. Herein, we demonstrate that maize catalases (ZmCATs) exhibited up-regulated enzymatic activities upon sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) infection. ZmCATs played crucial roles in SCMV multiplication and infection by catalysing the decomposition of excess cellular H2 O2 and promoting the accumulation of viral replication-related cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein through interaction. Peroxisome-localized ZmCATs were found to be distributed around SCMV replication vesicles in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Additionally, the helper component-protease (HC-Pro) of SCMV interacted with ZmCATs and enhanced catalase activities to promote viral accumulation. This study unveils a significant involvement of maize catalases in modulating SCMV multiplication and infection through interaction with two viral factors, thereby enhancing our understanding regarding viral strategies for manipulating host antioxidant mechanisms towards robust viral accumulation."
38466176,plant height; days to flowering,Cloning and functional analysis of ZmMADS42 gene in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important cereal crop in the world. Flowering period and photoperiod play important roles in the reproductive development of maize. This study, investigated ZmMADS42, a gene that is highly expressed in the shoot apical meristem. Agrobacterium infection was used to successfully obtain overexpressed ZmMADS42 plants. Fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that the expression of the ZmMADS42 gene in the shoot apical meristem of transgenic plants was 2.8 times higher than that of the wild-type(WT). In addition, the expression of the ZmMADS42 gene in the endosperm was 2.4 times higher than that in the wild-type. The seed width of the T2 generation increased by 5.35%, whereas the seed length decreased by 7.78% compared with that of the wild-type. Dissection of the shoot tips of transgenic and wild-type plants from the 7-leaf stage to the 9-leaf stage revealed that the transgenic plants entered the differentiation stage earlier and exhibited more tassel meristems during their vegetative growth period. The mature transgenic plants were approximately 20 cm shorter in height and had a lower panicle position than the wild-type plants. Comparing the flowering period, the tasseling, powdering, and silking stages of the transgenic plants occurred 10 days earlier than those of the wild-type plants. The results showed that the ZmMADS42 gene played a significant role in regulating the flowering period and plant height of maize."
38467539,response to fall armyworm,Endophytic Fungi-Mediated Defense Signaling in Maize: Unraveling the Role of WRKY36 in Regulating Immunity against Spodoptera frugiperda.,"Seed priming with beneficial endophytic fungi is an emerging sustainable strategy for enhancing plant resistance against insect pests. This study examined the effects of Beauvaria bassiana Bb20091317 and Metarhizium rileyi MrCDTLJ1 fungal colonization on maize growth, defence signalling, benzoxazinoid levels and gene expression. The colonization did not adversely affect plant growth but reduced larval weights of Spodoptera frugiperda. Maize leaves treated with M. rileyi exhibited higher levels of jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-Isoleucine, salicylic acid, and indole acetic acid compared to control. B. bassiana and M. rileyi accelerated phytohormone increase upon S. frugiperda herbivory. Gene expression analysis revealed modulation of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes. We further elucidated the immune regulatory role of the transcription factor zmWRKY36 using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in maize. zmWRKY36 positively regulates maize immunity against S. frugiperda, likely by interacting with defense-related proteins. Transient overexpression of zmWRKY36 in tobacco-induced cell death, while silencing in maize reduced chitin-triggered reactive oxygen species burst, confirming its immune function. Overall, B. bassiana and M. rileyi successfully colonized maize, impacting larval growth, defense signalling, and zmWRKY36-mediated resistance. This sheds light on maize-endophyte-insect interactions for sustainable plant protection."
38472657,response to low nitrogen,Fulvic acid alleviates the stress of low nitrogen on maize by promoting root development and nitrogen metabolism.,"The potential of fulvic acid (FA) to improve plant growth has been acknowledged, but its effect on plant growth and nutrient uptake under nutrient stress remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different FA application rates on maize growth and nitrogen utilization under low nitrogen stress. The results showed that under low nitrogen stress, FA significantly stimulated maize growth, particularly root development, biomass, and nitrogen content. The enhanced activity levels of key enzymes in nitrogen metabolism were observed, along with differential gene expression in maize, which enriched nitrogen metabolism, amino acid metabolism and plant hormone metabolism. The application of FA regulated the hormones' level, reduced abscisic acid content in leaves and Me-JA content in roots, and increased auxin and zeatin ribose content in leaves. This study concludes that, by promoting root development, nitrogen metabolism, and hormone metabolism, an appropriate concentration of FA can enhance plant tolerance to low nitrogen conditions and improve nitrogen use efficiency."
38472740,nitrogen use efficiency,NRG2 family members of Arabidopsis and maize regulate nitrate signalling and promote nitrogen use efficiency.,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and most plants absorb it as nitrate. AtNRG2 has been reported to play an important role in nitrate regulation. In this study, we investigated the functions of AtNRG2 family members of Arabidopsis thaliana and maize in nitrate signalling and metabolism. Our results showed that both AtNRG2.10 and AtNRG2.15 regulated nitrate signalling and metabolism. Overexpression of AtNRG2.11 (AtNRG2) could promote plant growth and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). In addition, the maize genome harbors 23 ZmNRG2 members. We detected the expression of these genes treated with nitrate and the expression of four genes was strongly induced with ZmNRG2.7 having the highest levels. Overexpression of ZmNRG2.7 in the atnrg2 mutant could restore the defects of atnrg2, suggesting that ZmNRG2.7 is involved in nitrate signalling and metabolism. Moreover, the overexpression lines of ZmNRG2.7 showed increased biomass and NUE. These findings demonstrate that at least a part of NRG2 family genes in Arabidopsis and maize regulate nitrate signalling and provide a molecular basis for improving the NUE of crops."
38483708,response to Cercospora,The symphony of maize signaling quartet defending against gray leaf spot.,"In plant immunity, a well-orchestrated cascade is initiated by the dimerization of receptor-like kinases (RLKs), followed by the phosphorylation of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) and subsequent activation of NADPH oxidases for ROS generation. Recent findings by Zhong et al. illustrated that a maize signaling module comprising ZmWAKL-ZmWIK-ZmBLK1-ZmRBOH4 governs quantitative disease resistance to grey leaf spot, a pervasive fungal disease in maize worldwide, unveiling the conservation of this signaling quartet in plant immunity."
38484013,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,NIa-Pro of sugarcane mosaic virus targets Corn Cysteine Protease 1 (CCP1) to undermine salicylic acid-mediated defense in maize.,"Papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) play pivotal roles in plant defense against pathogen invasions. While pathogens can secrete effectors to target and inhibit PLCP activities, the roles of PLCPs in plant-virus interactions and the mechanisms through which viruses neutralize PLCP activities remain largely uncharted. Here, we demonstrate that the expression and activity of a maize PLCP CCP1 (Corn Cysteine Protease), is upregulated following sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) infection. Transient silencing of CCP1 led to a reduction in PLCP activities, thereby promoting SCMV infection in maize. Furthermore, the knockdown of CCP1 resulted in diminished salicylic acid (SA) levels and suppressed expression of SA-responsive pathogenesis-related genes. This suggests that CCP1 plays a role in modulating the SA signaling pathway. Interestingly, NIa-Pro, the primary protease of SCMV, was found to interact with CCP1, subsequently inhibiting its protease activity. A specific motif within NIa-Pro termed the inhibitor motif was identified as essential for its interaction with CCP1 and the suppression of its activity. We have also discovered that the key amino acids responsible for the interaction between NIa-Pro and CCP1 are crucial for the virulence of SCMV. In conclusion, our findings offer compelling evidence that SCMV undermines maize defense mechanisms through the interaction of NIa-Pro with CCP1. Together, these findings shed a new light on the mechanism(s) controlling the arms races between virus and plant."
38484116,Anthocyanin content,"Phenolic Characterization of a Purple Maize (Zea mays cv. ""Moragro"") by HPLC-QTOF-MS and Study of Its Bioaccessibility Using a Simulated In Vitro Digestion/Caco-2 Culture Model.","The present work aimed to characterize the phenolic and antioxidant content of the Argentinian purple maize ""Moragro"" cultivar. Additionally, the INFOGEST simulated in vitro digestion model was used to establish the effect of digestion on bioactive compounds. Finally, digestion samples were used to treat Caco-2 cells in the transwell model to better understand their bioavailability. Twenty-six phenolic compounds were found in purple maize cv. ""Moragro"", 15 nonanthocyanins and 11 anthocyanins. Several compounds were identified in maize for the first time, such as pyrogallol, citric acid, gallic acid, kaempferol 3-(6″-ferulylglucoside), and kaempferol 3-glucuronide. Anthocyanins accounted for 24.9% of total polyphenols, with the predominant anthocyanin being cyanidin-3-(6″ malonylglucoside). Catechin-(4,8)-cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside and catechin-(4,8)-cyanidin-3-malonylglucoside-5-glucoside were detected as characteristics of this American maize variety. Total polyphenol content (TPC; by the Folin-Ciocalteu method), HPLC-DAD/MSMS, and antioxidant activity [by DPPH and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] were evaluated throughout in vitro digestion. TPC, DPPH, and FRAP results were 2.71 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g, 24 μmol Trolox equiv/g, and 22 μmol Trolox eq/g, respectively. The in vitro digestion process did not cause significant differences in TPC. However, the antioxidant activity was significantly decreased. Moreover, the bioavailability of anthocyanins was studied, showing that a small fraction of polyphenols in their intact form was conserved at the end of digestion. Finally, a protective effect of digested maize polyphenols was observed in the Caco-2 cell viability. The results suggest that ""Moragro"" purple maize is a good source of bioavailable anthocyanins in the diet and an interesting source of this group of compounds for the food industry."
38495581,response to nitrogen; chlorophyll content,Variation in Leaf Chlorophyll Concentration in Response to Nitrogen Application Across Maize Hybrids in Contrasting Environments.,"Leaf chlorophyll concentration was measured for 84 publicly available maize hybrids grown under three nitrogen fertilizer treatments in two contrasting environments in Nebraska. The effect of nitrogen treatment on chlorophyll response was found to be significant (p < 0.05) for both locations. In Scottsbluff, chlorophyll concentrations increased significantly with increasing nitrogen rate, while no significant difference was found between medium and high nitrogen in Lincoln. Within equivalent nitrogen treatments, chlorophyll was more abundant in Lincoln than Scottsbluff for nearly every hybrid. Hybrid response was not consistent between environments, with approximately 11% of variance explained by genotype by environment interaction."
38498254,osmotic stress response,"Maize multi-omics reveal leaf water status controlling of differential transcriptomes, proteomes and hormones as mechanisms of age-dependent osmotic stress response in leaves.","Drought-induced osmotic stress severely affects the growth and yield of maize. However, the mechanisms underlying the different responses of young and old maize leaves to osmotic stress remain unclear. To gain a systematic understanding of age-related stress responses, we compared osmotic-stress-induced changes in maize leaves of different ages using multi-omics approaches. After short-term osmotic stress, old leaves suffered more severe water deficits than young leaves. The adjustments of transcriptomes, proteomes, and hormones in response to osmotic stress were more dynamic in old leaves. Metabolic activities, stress signaling pathways, and hormones (especially abscisic acid) responded to osmotic stress in an age-dependent manner. We identified multiple functional clusters of genes and proteins with potential roles in stress adaptation. Old leaves significantly accumulated stress proteins such as dehydrin, aquaporin, and chaperones to cope with osmotic stress, accompanied by senescence-like cellular events, whereas young leaves exhibited an effective water conservation strategy mainly by hydrolyzing transitory starch and increasing proline production. The stress responses of individual leaves are primarily determined by their intracellular water status, resulting in differential transcriptomes, proteomes, and hormones. This study extends our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to osmotic stress."
38498536,response to Bipolaris maydis,Physiological and Biochemical Aspects of Silicon-Mediated Resistance in Maize against Maydis Leaf Blight.,"Maydis leaf blight (MLB), caused by the necrotrophic fungus Bipolaris maydis, has caused considerable yield losses in maize production. The hypothesis that maize plants with higher foliar silicon (Si) concentration can be more resistant against MLB was investigated in this study. This goal was achieved through an in-depth analysis of the photosynthetic apparatus (parameters of leaf gas exchange chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence and photosynthetic pigments) changes in activities of defense and antioxidative enzymes in leaves of maize plants with (+Si; 2 mM) and without (-Si; 0 mM) Si supplied, as well as challenged and not with B. maydis. The +Si plants showed reduced MLB symptoms (smaller lesions and lower disease severity) due to higher foliar Si concentration and less production of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and radical anion superoxide compared to -Si plants. Higher values for leaf gas exchange (rate of net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance to water vapor, and transpiration rate) and Chl a fluorescence (variable-to-maximum Chl a fluorescence ratio, photochemical yield, and yield for dissipation by downregulation) parameters along with preserved pool of chlorophyll a+b and carotenoids were noticed for infected +Si plants compared to infected -Si plants. Activities of defense (chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase, and lipoxygenase) and antioxidative (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase) enzymes were higher for infected +Si plants compared to infected -Si plants. Collectively, this study highlights the importance of using Si to boost maize resistance against MLB considering the more operative defense reactions and the robustness of the antioxidative metabolism of plants along with the preservation of their photosynthetic apparatus."
38499777,haploid production,Cyto-swapping in maize by haploid induction with a cenh3 mutant,"Maize mutants of the centromeric histone H3 (CENP-A/CENH3) gene can form haploids that inherit only chromosomes of the pollinating parent but the cytoplasm from the female parent. We developed CENH3 haploid inducers carrying a dominant anthocyanin colour marker for efficient haploid identification and harbouring cytoplasmic male sterile cytoplasm, a type of cytoplasm that results in male sterility useful for efficient hybrid seed production. The resulting cytoplasmic male sterility cyto-swapping method provides a faster and cheaper way to convert commercial lines to cytoplasmic male sterile compared to conventional trait introgression."
38501459,days to flowering,FKF1b controls reproductive transition associated with adaptation to geographical distribution in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays subspecies mays) is an important commercial crop across the world, and its flowering time is closely related to grain yield, plant cycle and latitude adaptation. FKF1 is an essential clock-regulated blue-light receptor with distinct functions on flowering time in plants, and its function in maize remains unclear. In this study, we identified two FKF1 homologs in the maize genome, named ZmFKF1a and ZmFKF1b, and indicated that ZmFKF1a and ZmFKF1b independently regulate reproductive transition through interacting with ZmCONZ1 and ZmGI1 to increase the transcription levels of ZmCONZ1 and ZCN8. We demonstrated that ZmFKF1b underwent artificial selection during modern breeding in China probably due to its role in geographical adaptation. Furthermore, our data suggested that ZmFKF1bHap_C7 may be an elite allele, which increases the abundance of ZmCONZ1 mRNA more efficiently and adapt to a wider range of temperature zone than that of ZmFKF1bHap_Z58 to promote maize floral transition. It extends our understanding of the genetic diversity of maize flowering. This allele is expected to be introduced into tropical maize germplasm to enrich breeding resources and may improve the adaptability of maize at different climate zones, especially at temperate region."
38510827,leaf angle; leaf canopy architecture,Three-Dimensional Modeling of Maize Canopies Based on Computational Intelligence.,"The 3-dimensional (3D) modeling of crop canopies is fundamental for studying functional-structural plant models. Existing studies often fail to capture the structural characteristics of crop canopies, such as organ overlapping and resource competition. To address this issue, we propose a 3D maize modeling method based on computational intelligence. An initial 3D maize canopy is created using the t-distribution method to reflect characteristics of the plant architecture. The subsequent model considers the 3D phytomers of maize as intelligent agents. The aim is to maximize the ratio of sunlit leaf area, and by iteratively modifying the azimuth angle of the 3D phytomers, a 3D maize canopy model that maximizes light resource interception can be constructed. Additionally, the method incorporates a reflective approach to optimize the canopy and utilizes a mesh deformation technique for detecting and responding to leaf collisions within the canopy. Six canopy models of 2 varieties plus 3 planting densities was constructed for validation. The average R2 of the difference in azimuth angle between adjacent leaves is 0.71, with a canopy coverage error range of 7% to 17%. Another 3D maize canopy model constructed using 12 distinct density gradients demonstrates the proportion of leaves perpendicular to the row direction increases along with the density. The proportion of these leaves steadily increased after 9 × 104 plants ha-1. This study presents a 3D modeling method for the maize canopy. It is a beneficial exploration of swarm intelligence on crops and generates a new way for exploring efficient resources utilization of crop canopies."
38511857,flavonoid content,"Cloning, Expression, and Functional Characterization of Two Highly Efficient Flavonoid-di-O-glycosyltransferases ZmUGT84A1 and ZmUGT84A2 from Maize (Zea mays L.).","The maize (Zea mays L.) glycosyltransferase family 1 comprises many uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT) members. However, UGT activities and biochemical functions have seldom been revealed. In this study, the genes of two flavonoid di-O-glycosyltransferases ZmUGT84A1 and ZmUGT84A2 were cloned from maize plant and expressed in Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two enzymes were homologous to AtUGT84A1 and AtUGT84A3. The two recombinant enzymes showed a high conversion rate of luteolin to its glucosides, mainly 4',7-di-O-glucoside and minorly 3',7-di-O-glucoside in two-step glycosylation reactions in vitro. Moreover, the recombinant ZmUGT84A1 and ZmUGT84A2 had a broad substrate spectrum, converting eriodictyol, naringenin, apigenin, quercetin, and kaempferol to monoglucosides and diglucosides. The highly efficient ZmUGT84A1 and ZmUGT84A2 may be used as a tool for the effective synthesis of various flavonoid O-glycosides and as markers for crop breeding to increase O-glycosyl flavonoid content in food."
38513094,response to arsenic,Root-exuded specialized metabolites reduce arsenic toxicity in maize.,"By releasing specialized metabolites, plants modify their environment. Whether and how specialized metabolites protect plants against toxic levels of trace elements is not well understood. We evaluated whether benzoxazinoids, which are released into the soil by major cereals, can confer protection against arsenic toxicity. Benzoxazinoid-producing maize plants performed better in arsenic-contaminated soils than benzoxazinoid-deficient mutants in the greenhouse and the field. Adding benzoxazinoids to the soil restored the protective effect, and the effect persisted to the next crop generation via positive plant-soil feedback. Arsenate levels in the soil and total arsenic levels in the roots were lower in the presence of benzoxazinoids. Thus, the protective effect of benzoxazinoids is likely soil-mediated and includes changes in soil arsenic speciation and root accumulation. We conclude that exuded specialized metabolites can enhance protection against toxic trace elements via soil-mediated processes and may thereby stabilize crop productivity in polluted agroecosystems. 
Significance: Toxic levels of arsenic in the soil can substantially reduce crop yields. Here, we reveal a mechanism to reduce plant arsenic accumulation and toxicity. Benzoxazinoids, a dominant class of specialized metabolites (also called secondary metabolites) produced by cereals such as wheat and maize, can reduce arsenic uptake and improve plant performance in the greenhouse and in the field. Furthermore, benzoxazinoid exudation into the soil enhances the performance of subsequent plant generations in soils with high levels of arsenic. This work expands the available genetically encoded resistance strategies to stabilize crop productivity in polluted agroecosystems."
38513610,photoperiod response,"CONSTANS, a HUB for all seasons: How photoperiod pervades plant physiology regulatory circuits.","How does a plant detect the changing seasons and make important developmental decisions accordingly? How do they incorporate daylength information into their routine physiological processes? Photoperiodism, or the capacity to measure the daylength, is a crucial aspect of plant development that helps plants determine the best time of the year to make vital decisions, such as flowering. The protein CONSTANS (CO) constitutes the central regulator of this sensing mechanism, not only activating florigen production in the leaves but also participating in many physiological aspects in which seasonality is important. Recent discoveries place CO in the center of a gene network that can determine the length of the day and confer seasonal input to aspects of plant development and physiology as important as senescence, seed size, or circadian rhythms. In this review, we discuss the importance of CO protein structure, function, and evolutionary mechanisms that embryophytes have developed to incorporate annual information into their physiology."
38514787,response to Massilia; root morphology,Heritable microbiome variation is correlated with source environment in locally adapted maize varieties,"Beneficial interactions with microorganisms are pivotal for crop performance and resilience. However, it remains unclear how heritable the microbiome is with respect to the host plant genotype and to what extent host genetic mechanisms can modulate plant–microbiota interactions in the face of environmental stresses. Here we surveyed 3,168 root and rhizosphere microbiome samples from 129 accessions of locally adapted Zea, sourced from diverse habitats and grown under control and different stress conditions. We quantified stress treatment and host genotype effects on the microbiome. Plant genotype and source environment were predictive of microbiome abundance. Genome-wide association analysis identified host genetic variants linked to both rhizosphere microbiome abundance and source environment. We identified transposon insertions in a candidate gene linked to both the abundance of a keystone bacterium Massilia in our controlled experiments and total soil nitrogen in the source environment. Isolation and controlled inoculation of Massilia alone can contribute to root development, whole-plant biomass production and adaptation to low nitrogen availability. We conclude that locally adapted maize varieties exert patterns of genetic control on their root and rhizosphere microbiomes that follow variation in their home environments, consistent with a role in tolerance to prevailing stress."
38516203,response to maize rough dwarf virus,Gene pyramiding of ZmGLK36 and ZmGDIα-hel for rough dwarf disease resistance in maize,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) caused by pathogenic viruses in the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae is one of the most destructive diseases in maize. The pyramiding of effective resistance genes into maize varieties is a potential approach to reduce the damage resulting from the disease. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (qMrdd2 and qMrdd8) have been previously identified. The resistance genes ZmGLK36 and ZmGDIα-hel have also been cloned with the functional markers Indel-26 and IDP25K, respectively. In this study, ZmGLK36 and ZmGDIα-hel were introgressed to improve MRDD resistance of maize lines (Zheng58, Chang7-2, B73, Mo17, and their derived hybrids Zhengdan958 and B73 × Mo17) via marker-assisted selection (MAS). The converted lines and their derived hybrids, carrying one or two genes, were evaluated for MRDD resistance using artificial inoculation methods. The double-gene pyramiding lines and their derived hybrids exhibited increased resistance to MRDD compared to the monogenic lines and the respective hybrids. The genetic backgrounds of the converted lines were highly similar (90.85–98.58%) to the recurrent parents. In addition, agronomic trait evaluation demonstrated that pyramiding lines with one or two genes and their derived hybrids were not significantly different from the recurrent parents and their hybrids under nonpathogenic stress, including period traits (tasseling, pollen shedding, and silking), yield traits (ear length, grain weight per ear and 100-kernel weight) and quality traits (protein and starch content). There were differences in plant architecture traits between the improved lines and their hybrids. This study illustrated the successful development of gene pyramiding for improving MRDD resistance by advancing the breeding process."
38519520,kernel type,An ARF gene mutation creates flint kernel architecture in dent maize,"Dent and flint kernel architectures are important characteristics that affect the physical properties of maize kernels and their grain end uses. The genes controlling these traits are unknown, so it is difficult to combine the advantageous kernel traits of both. We found mutation of ARFTF17 in a dent genetic background reduces IAA content in the seed pericarp, creating a flint-like kernel phenotype. ARFTF17 is highly expressed in the pericarp and encodes a protein that interacts with and inhibits MYB40, a transcription factor with the dual functions of repressing PIN1 expression and transactivating genes for flavonoid biosynthesis. Enhanced flavonoid biosynthesis could reduce the metabolic flux responsible for auxin biosynthesis. The decreased IAA content of the dent pericarp appears to reduce cell division and expansion, creating a shorter, denser kernel. Introgression of the ARFTF17 mutation into dent inbreds and hybrids improved their kernel texture, integrity, and desiccation, without affecting yield."
38527761,internode elongation,Unveiling the Regulatory Role of miRNAs in Internode Elongation: Integrated Analysis of MicroRNA and mRNA Expression Profiles across Diverse Dwarfing Treatments in Maize (Zea mays L.),"MicroRNAs are crucial regulators of gene expression in maize. However, the mechanisms through which miRNAs control internode elongation remain poorly understood. This study engineered varying levels of internode elongation inhibition, revealing that dwarfing treatments diminished gibberellin levels, curtailed cell longitudinal growth, and slowed the rate of internode elongation. Comprehensive transcriptome and miRNA profiling of the internode elongation zone showed gene expression changes that paralleled the extent of the internode length reduction. We identified 543 genes and 29 miRNAs with significant correlations to internode length, predominantly within families, including miR164 and miR396. By incorporating target gene expression levels, we pinpointed nine miRNA-mRNA pairs that are significantly associated with the regulation of the internode elongation. The inhibitory effects of these miRNAs on their target genes were confirmed through dual-luciferase reporter assays. Overexpression of miR164h in maize resulted in increased internode and cell length, suggesting a novel genetic avenue for manipulating plant stature. These miRNAs may also serve as precise spatiotemporal regulators for in vitro plant development."
38531358,leaf development,The WIP6 transcription factor too many laterals specifies vein type in C4 and C3 grass leaves,"Grass leaves are invariantly strap shaped with an elongated distal blade and a proximal sheath that wraps around the stem. Underpinning this shape is a scaffold of leaf veins, most of which extend in parallel along the proximo-distal leaf axis. Differences between species are apparent both in the vein types that develop and in the distance between veins across the medio-lateral leaf axis. A prominent engineering goal is to increase vein density in leaves of C3 photosynthesizing species to facilitate the introduction of the more efficient C4 pathway. Here, we discover that the WIP6 transcription factor TOO MANY LATERALS (TML) specifies vein rank in both maize (C4) and rice (C3). Loss-of-function tml mutations cause large lateral veins to develop in positions normally occupied by smaller intermediate veins, and TML transcript localization in wild-type leaves is consistent with a role in suppressing lateral vein development in procambial cells that form intermediate veins. Attempts to manipulate TML function in rice were unsuccessful because transgene expression was silenced, suggesting that precise TML expression is essential for shoot viability. This finding may reflect the need to prevent the inappropriate activation of downstream targets or, given that transcriptome analysis revealed altered cytokinin and auxin signaling profiles in maize tml mutants, the need to prevent local or general hormonal imbalances. Importantly, rice tml mutants display an increased occupancy of veins in the leaf, providing a step toward an anatomical chassis for C4 engineering. Collectively, a conserved mechanism of vein rank specification in grass leaves has been revealed. 
Highlights: 
    •    Function of WIP6 ortholog TML is conserved in maize and rice 
    •    TML is expressed in procambial cells during early leaf vein development 
    •    tml mutants develop large lateral veins in places where smaller veins should form 
    •    TML function suppresses lateral vein development in a subset of procambial initials"
38531994,Abiotic stress response,Antioxidant production promotes defense mechanism and different gene expression level in Zea mays under abiotic stress,"The growth and productivity of maize are severely affected by soil salinity. The crucial determinants for the future performance of plants are productive for seed germination and seedling establishment; however, both stages are liable to soil salinity. For grain, maize is an economically significant crop sensitive to abiotic stresses. However, little is known about defense responses by the salinity-induced antioxidant and oxidative stress in maize. In our work, the commercially available maize variety Raka-Poshi was grown in pots for 30 days under greenhouse conditions. To evaluate the salt-induced oxidative/antioxidant responses in maize for salt stress 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mM concentrations, treatments were provided using sodium chloride (NaCl). All the biochemical indices were calculated under all NaCl concentrations, while drought was induced by up to 50% irrigation water. After 30 days of seed germination, the maize leaves were collected for the measurement of lipid peroxidase or malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione reductase (GR), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipoxygenase (LOX), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The results revealed a 47% reduction under 150 mM NaCl and 50% drought stress conditions. The results have shown that the successive increase of NaCl concentrations and drought caused an increase in catalase production. With successive increase in NaCl concentration and drought stress, lower levels of H2O2, SOD, and MDA were detected in maize leaves. The results regarding the morphology of maize seedlings indicated a successive reduction in the root length and shoot length under applications of salt and drought stress, while root-to-shoot weights were found to be increased under drought stress and decreased under salt stress conditions During gene expression analysis collectively indicate that, under drought stress conditions, the expression levels of all nine mentioned enzyme-related genes were consistently downregulated."
38537616,cuticular lipids,Dynamic relationships among pathways producing hydrocarbons and fatty acids of maize silk cuticular waxes.,"The hydrophobic cuticle is the first line of defense between aerial portions of plants and the external environment. On maize (Zea mays L.) silks, the cuticular cutin matrix is infused with cuticular waxes, consisting of a homologous series of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), aldehydes, and hydrocarbons. Together with VLC fatty-acyl-CoAs (VLCFA-CoAs), these metabolites serve as precursors, intermediates and end-products of the cuticular wax biosynthetic pathway. To deconvolute the potentially confounding impacts of the change in silk microenvironment and silk development on this pathway, we profiled cuticular waxes on the silks of the inbreds B73 and Mo17, and their reciprocal hybrids. Multivariate interrogation of these metabolite abundance data demonstrates that VLCFA-CoAs and total free VLCFAs are positively correlated with the cuticular wax metabolome, and this metabolome is primarily affected by changes in the silk microenvironment and plant genotype. Moreover, the genotype effect on the pathway explains the increased accumulation of cuticular hydrocarbons with a concomitant reduction in cuticular VLCFA accumulation on B73 silks, suggesting that the conversion of VLCFA-CoAs to hydrocarbons is more effective in B73 than Mo17. Statistical modeling of the ratios between cuticular hydrocarbons and cuticular VLCFAs reveals a significant role of precursor chain length in determining this ratio. This study establishes the complexity of the product-precursor relationships within the silk cuticular wax-producing network by dissecting both the impact of genotype and the allocation of VLCFA-CoA precursors to different biological processes, and demonstrates that longer chain VLCFA-CoAs are preferentially utilized for hydrocarbon biosynthesis."
38540348,response to heat stress,Heat-Resistant Inbred Lines Coordinate the Heat Response Gene Expression Remarkably in Maize (Zea mays L.).,"High temperatures are increasingly becoming a prominent environmental factor accelerating the adverse influence on the growth and development of maize (Zea mays L.). Therefore, it is critical to identify the key genes and pathways related to heat stress (HS) tolerance in maize. Great challenges have been faced in dissecting genetic mechanisms and uncovering master genes for HS tolerance. Here, Z58D showed more thermotolerance than AF171 at the seedling stage with a lower wilted leaf rate and H2O2 accumulation under HS conditions. Transcriptomic analysis identified 3006 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AF171 and 4273 DEGs in Z58D under HS treatments, respectively. Subsequently, GO enrichment analysis showed that commonly upregulated genes in AF171 and Z58D were significantly enriched in the following biological processes, including protein folding, response to heat, response to temperature stimulus and response to hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the comparison between the two inbred lines under HS showed that response to heat and response to temperature stimulus were significantly over-represented for the 1234 upregulated genes in Z58D. Furthermore, more commonly upregulated genes exhibited higher expression levels in Z58D than AF171. In addition, maize inbred CIMBL55 was verified to be more tolerant than B73, and more commonly upregulated genes also showed higher expression levels in CIMBL55 than B73 under HS. These consistent results indicate that heat-resistant inbred lines may coordinate the remarkable expression of genes in order to recover from HS. Additionally, 35 DEGs were conserved among five inbred lines via comparative transcriptomic analysis. Most of them were more pronounced in Z58D than AF171 at the expression levels. These candidate genes may confer thermotolerance in maize."
38542154,leaf angle,Phenotypic Investigation and RNA-seq of KN1 Involved in Leaf Angle Formation in Maize (Zea mays L.),"Leaf angle (LA) is one of the core agronomic traits of maize, which controls maize yield by affecting planting density. Previous studies have shown that the KN1 gene is closely related to the formation of maize LA, but its specific mechanism has not been fully studied. In this study, phenotype investigation and transcriptomic sequencing were combined to explore the mechanism of LA changes in wild type maize B73 and mutant kn1 under exogenous auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The results showed that the effect of exogenous phytohormones had a greater impact on the LA of kn1 compared to B73. Transcriptome sequencing showed that genes involved in IAA, gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs) showed different differential expression patterns in kn1 and B73. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of KN1 involved in the formation of maize LA, and provides a theoretical basis for breeding maize varieties with suitable LA."
38542340,root development; potassium content,Integrated Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Analysis of Exogenous NAA Effects on Maize Seedling Root Systems under Potassium Deficiency,"Auxin plays a crucial role in regulating root growth and development, and its distribution pattern under environmental stimuli significantly influences root plasticity. Under K deficiency, the interaction between K+ transporters and auxin can modulate root development. This study compared the differences in root morphology and physiological mechanisms of the low-K-tolerant maize inbred line 90-21-3 and K-sensitive maize inbred line D937 under K-deficiency (K+ = 0.2 mM) with exogenous NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA = 0.01 mM) treatment. Root systems of 90-21-3 exhibited higher K+ absorption efficiency. Conversely, D937 seedling roots demonstrated greater plasticity and higher K+ content. In-depth analysis through transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed that 90-21-3 and D937 seedling roots showed differential responses to exogenous NAA under K-deficiency. In 90-21-3, upregulation of the expression of K+ absorption and transport-related proteins (proton-exporting ATPase and potassium transporter) and the enrichment of antioxidant-related functional genes were observed. In D937, exogenous NAA promoted the responses of genes related to intercellular ethylene and cation transport to K-deficiency. Differential metabolite enrichment analysis primarily revealed significant enrichment in flavonoid biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, and hormone signaling pathways. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is a crucial pathway, with core genes (related to peroxidase enzyme) and core metabolites upregulated in 90-21-3. The findings suggest that under K-deficiency, exogenous NAA induces substantial changes in maize roots, with the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway playing a crucial role in the maize root’s response to exogenous NAA regulation under K-deficiency."
38542350,kernel row number,Genome-Wide Association Studies on the Kernel Row Number in a Multi-Parent Maize Population,"Kernel row number (KRN) is a crucial trait in maize that directly influences yield; hence, understanding the mechanisms underlying KRN is vital for the development of high-yielding inbred lines and hybrids. We crossed four excellent panicle inbred lines (CML312, CML444, YML46, and YML32) with Ye107, and after eight generations of selfing, a multi-parent population was developed comprising four subpopulations, each consisting of 200 lines. KRN was accessed in five environments in Yunnan province over three years (2019, 2021, and 2022). The objectives of this study were to (1) identify quantitative trait loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with KRN through linkage and genome-wide association analyses using high-quality genotypic data, (2) identify candidate genes regulating KRN by identifying co-localized QTLs and SNPs, and (3) explore the pathways involved in KRN formation and identify key candidate genes through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Our study successfully identified 277 significant Quantitative trait locus (QTLs) and 53 significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) related to KRN. Based on gene expression, GO, and KEGG analyses, SNP-177304649, SNP-150393177, SNP-135283055, SNP-138554600, and SNP-120370778, which were highly likely to be associated with KRN, were identified. Seven novel candidate genes at this locus (Zm00001d022420, Zm00001d022421, Zm00001d016202, Zm00001d050984, Zm00001d050985, Zm00001d016000, and Zm00014a012929) are associated with KRN. Among these, Zm00014a012929 was identified using the reference genome Mo17. The remaining six genes were identified using the reference genome B73. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of these genes with KRN in maize. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying maize KRN and the development of high-yielding hybrids through heterosis."
38548388,carotenoid content,Linkage and association mapping in multi-parental populations reveal the genetic basis of carotenoid variation in maize kernels.,"Carotenoids are indispensable to plants and critical components of the human diet. The carotenoid metabolic pathway is conserved across plant species, but our understanding of the genetic basis of carotenoid variation remains limited for the seeds of most cereal crops. To address this issue, we systematically performed linkage and association mapping for eight carotenoid traits using six recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. Single linkage mapping (SLM) and joint linkage mapping (JLM) identified 77 unique additive QTLs and 104 pairs of epistatic QTLs. Among these QTLs, we identified 22 overlapping hotspots of additive and epistatic loci, highlighting the important contributions of some QTLs to carotenoid levels through additive or epistatic mechanisms. A genome-wide association study based on all RILs detected 244 candidate genes significantly associated with carotenoid traits, 23 of which were annotated as carotenoid pathway genes. Effect comparisons suggested that a small number of loci linked to pathway genes have substantial effects on carotenoid variation in our tested populations, but many loci not associated with pathway genes also make important contributions to carotenoid variation. We identified ZmPTOX as the causal gene for a QTL hotspot (Q10/JLM10/GWAS019); this gene encodes a putative plastid terminal oxidase that produces plastoquinone-9 used by two enzymes in the carotenoid pathway. Natural variants in the promoter and second exon of ZmPTOX were found to alter carotenoid levels. This comprehensive assessment of the genetic mechanisms underlying carotenoid variation establishes a foundation for rewiring carotenoid metabolism and accumulation for efficient carotenoid biofortification."
38555318,silk color,Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of qSRC3 controlling the silk color in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Fine mapping of the maize QTL qSRC3, responsible for red silk, uncovered the candidate gene ZmMYB20, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, has light-sensitive expression, and putatively regulates genes expression associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis. Colorless silk is a key characteristic contributing to the visual quality of fresh corn intended for market distribution. Nonetheless, the identification of Mendelian trait loci and associated genes that control silk color has been scarce. In this study, a F2 population arising from the hybridization of the single-segment substitution line qSRC3MT1 with red silk, carrying an introgressed allele from teosinte (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), and the recurrent maize inbred line Mo17, characterized by light green silk, was utilized for fine mapping. We found that the red silk trait is controlled by a semi-dominant genetic locus known as qSRC3, and its expression is susceptible to light-mediated inhibition. Moreover, qSRC3 explained 68.78% of the phenotypic variance and was delimited to a 133.2 kb region, which includes three genes. Subsequent expression analyses revealed that ZmMYB20 (Zm00001d039700), which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, was the key candidate gene within qSRC3. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assays provided evidence that ZmMYB20 suppresses the expression of two crucial anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, namely ZmF3H and ZmUFGT, by directly binding to their respective promoter regions. Our findings underscore the significance of light-inhibited ZmMYB20 in orchestrating the spatial and temporal regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results advance the production of colorless silk in fresh corn, responding to the misconception that fresh corn with withered colored silk is not fresh and providing valuable genetic resources for the improvement of sweet and waxy maize."
38556556,drought response,"Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of the AP2/EREBP, COX and LTP genes in Zea mays L. under drought stress.","AP2 (APETALA2)/EREBP (ethylene-responsive element-binding protein), cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (LTP) play important roles in the response to drought stress. This is the first study to identify the COX gene in Zea mays L. via genome-wide analysis. The qRT‒PCR results indicated that AP2/EREBP, COX and LTP were downregulated, with fold changes of 0.84, 0.53 and 0.31, respectively, after 12 h of drought stress. Genome-wide analysis identified 78 AP2/EREBP, 6 COX and 10 LTP genes in Z. mays L. Domain analysis confirmed the presence of the AP2 domain, Cyt_c_Oxidase_Vb domain and nsLTP1 in the AP2/EREBP, COX and LTP proteins, respectively. The AP2/EREBP protein family (AP2) includes five different domain types: the AP2/ERF domain, the EREBP-like factor (EREBP), the ethylene responsive factor (ERF), the dehydration responsive element binding protein (DREB) and the SHN SHINE. Synteny analysis of the AP2/EREBP, COX and LTP genes revealed collinearity orthologous relationships in O. sativa, H. vulgare and A. thaliana. AP2/EREBP genes were found on the 10 chromosomes of Z. mays L. COX genes were found on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8. LTP genes were found on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 10. In the present study, the Ka/Ks ratios of the AP2/EREBP paralogous pairs indicated that the AP2/EREBP genes were influenced primarily by purifying selection, which indicated that the AP2/EREBP genes received strong environmental pressure during evolution. The Ka/Ks ratios of the COX-3/COX-4 paralogous pairs indicate that the COX-3/COX-4 genes were influenced primarily by Darwinian selection (driving change). For the LTP genes, the Ka/Ks ratios of the LTP-1/LTP-10, LTP-5/LTP-3 and LTP-4/LTP-8 paralogous pairs indicate that these genes were influenced primarily by purifying selection, while the Ka/Ks ratios of the LTP-2/LTP-6 paralogous pairs indicate that these genes were influenced primarily by Darwinian selection. The duplication time of the AP2/EREBP paralogous gene pairs in Z. mays L. ranged from approximately 9.364 to 100.935 Mya. The duplication time of the COX-3/COX-4 paralogous gene pair was approximately 5.217 Mya. The duplication time of the LTP paralogous gene pairs ranged from approximately 19.064 to 96.477 Mya. The major focus of research is to identify the genes that are responsible for drought stress tolerance to improve maize for drought stress tolerance. The results of the present study will improve the understanding of the functions of the AP2/EREBP, COX and LTP genes in response to drought stress."
38561757,root development,A system for the study of roots 3D kinematics in hydroponic culture: a study on the oscillatory features of root tip.,"Background: The root of a plant is a fundamental organ for the multisensory perception of the environment. Investigating root growth dynamics as a mean of their interaction with the environment is of key importance for improving knowledge in plant behaviour, plant biology and agriculture. To date, it is difficult to study roots movements from a dynamic perspective given that available technologies for root imaging focus mostly on static characterizations, lacking temporal and three-dimensional (3D) spatial information. This paper describes a new system based on time-lapse for the 3D reconstruction and analysis of roots growing in hydroponics. 

Results: The system is based on infrared stereo-cameras acquiring time-lapse images of the roots for 3D reconstruction. The acquisition protocol guarantees the root growth in complete dark while the upper part of the plant grows in normal light conditions. The system extracts the 3D trajectory of the root tip and a set of descriptive features in both the temporal and frequency domains. The system has been used on Zea mays L. (B73) during the first week of growth and shows good inter-reliability between operators with an Intra Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) > 0.9 for all features extracted. It also showed measurement accuracy with a median difference of < 1 mm between computed and manually measured root length. 

Conclusions: The system and the protocol presented in this study enable accurate 3D analysis of primary root growth in hydroponics. It can serve as a valuable tool for analysing real-time root responses to environmental stimuli thus improving knowledge on the processes contributing to roots physiological and phenotypic plasticity."
38571604,grain quality,Flavor and TASTE attributes and nutritional insights of maize tortillas from landraces of Mexican races.,"Maize tortilla is the best-recognized food product of Mexican gastronomy. Artisanal maize tortillas (AMT) are prepared with native maize varieties and a traditional process. The aims of this study were to identify sensory attributes, texture, and color in AMT that allow them to be differentiated from commercial tortillas, and to determine the chemical and mineral composition of both types of tortillas. Six landraces related to four Mexican maize races were used. Two commercial tortillas were included as references (tortillería and supermarket). Tortillas were subjected to sensory analysis by the modified Flash technique, texture and color were measured objectively and chemical and mineral analysis of all tortillas were evaluated. Lime taste and lime smell attributes were relevant to differentiate AMT from commercial tortillas; aftertaste and fracturability attributes were highly associated to supermarket tortillas. The fracturability attribute of tortillas is consider undesirable for taco preparation. Five of the six AMT were characterized by the presence of a layer, a characteristic that is associated with traditional tortilla made by Mexican consumer. Regarding chemical composition, supermarket tortillas exhibited the highest dietary fiber content (17.09%), but showed 30% more Na than AMT, with the exception of tortillas from Purepecha native variety. Besides, supermarket tortilla had 48.9% less Ca than AMT. The sensory attributes relevant to differentiate native maize tortillas from the commercial maize tortilla references were appearance, smell, and taste, while textural and color attributes played a lesser role."
38573521,response to heat stress,The Heat shock factor 20-HSF4-Cellulose synthase A2 module regulates heat stress tolerance in maize.,"Temperature shapes the geographical distribution and behavior of plants. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying the plant heat response is important for developing climate-resilient crops, including maize (Zea mays). To identify transcription factors that may contribute to the maize heat response, we generated a dataset of short- and long-term transcriptome changes following a heat treatment time course in the inbred line B73. Co-expression network analysis highlighted several transcription factors, including the class B2a heat shock factor (HSF) ZmHSF20. Zmhsf20 mutant seedlings exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat stress. Furthermore, DNA affinity purification sequencing and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assays demonstrated that ZmHSF20 binds to the promoters of Cellulose synthase A2 (ZmCesA2) and three class A Hsf genes, including ZmHsf4, repressing their transcription. We showed that ZmCesA2 and ZmHSF4 promote the heat response, with ZmHSF4 directly activating ZmCesA2 transcription. In agreement with the transcriptome analysis, ZmHSF20 inhibited cellulose accumulation and repressed the expression of cell wall-related genes. Importantly, the Zmhsf20 Zmhsf4 double mutant exhibited decreased thermotolerance, placing ZmHsf4 downstream of ZmHsf20. We proposed an expanded model of the heat stress response in maize, whereby ZmHSF20 lowers seedling heat tolerance by repressing ZmHsf4 and ZmCesA2, thus balancing seedling growth and defense."
38575869,drought response,Maize ZmLAZ1-3 gene negatively regulates drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Background: Molecular mechanisms in response to drought stress are important for the genetic improvement of maize. In our previous study, nine ZmLAZ1 members were identified in the maize genome, but the function of ZmLAZ1 was largely unknown. 

Results: The ZmLAZ1-3 gene was cloned from B73, and its drought-tolerant function was elucidated by expression analysis in transgenic Arabidopsis. The expression of ZmLAZ1-3 was upregulated by drought stress in different maize inbred lines. The driving activity of the ZmLAZ1-3 promoter was induced by drought stress and related to the abiotic stress-responsive elements such as MYB, MBS, and MYC. The results of subcellular localization indicated that the ZmLAZ1-3 protein localized on the plasma membrane and chloroplast. The ectopic expression of the ZmLAZ1-3 gene in Arabidopsis significantly reduced germination ratio and root length, decreased biomass, and relative water content, but increased relative electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content under drought stress. Moreover, transcriptomics analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes between the transgenic lines and wild-type were mainly associated with response to abiotic stress and biotic stimulus, and related to pathways of hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and plant-pathogen interaction. 

Conclusion: The study suggests that the ZmLAZ1-3 gene is a negative regulator in regulating drought tolerance and can be used to improve maize drought tolerance via its silencing or knockout."
38578443,ear length,Identification of a novel marker and its associated laccase gene for regulating ear length in tropical and subtropical maize lines.,"This study revealed the identification of a novel gene, Zm00001d042906, that regulates maize ear length by modulating lignin synthesis and reported a molecular marker for selecting maize lines with elongated ears. Maize ear length has garnered considerable attention due to its high correlation with yield. In this study, six maize inbred lines of significant importance in maize breeding were used as parents. The temperate maize inbred line Ye107, characterized by a short ear, was crossed with five tropical or subtropical inbred lines featuring longer ears, creating a multi-parent population displaying significant variations in ear length. Through genome-wide association studies and mutation analysis, the A/G variation at SNP_183573532 on chromosome 3 was identified as an effective site for discriminating long-ear maize. Furthermore, the associated gene Zm00001d042906 was found to correlate with maize ear length. Zm00001d042906 was functionally annotated as a laccase (Lac4), which showed activity and influenced lignin synthesis in the midsection cells of the cob, thereby regulating maize ear length. This study further reports a novel molecular marker and a new gene that can assist maize breeding programs in selecting varieties with elongated ears."
38586117,drought response,Pre-silking water deficit in maize induced kernel loss through impaired silk growth and ovary carbohydrate dynamics.,"Both carbon limitation and developmentally driven kernel failure occur in the apical region of maize (Zea mays L.) ears. Failed kernel development in the basal and middle regions of the ear often is neglected because their spaces usually are occupied by adjacent ovaries at harvest. We tested the spatial distribution of kernel losses and potential underlying reasons, from perspectives of silk elongation and carbohydrate dynamics, when maize experienced water deficit during silk elongation. Kernel loss was distributed along the length of the ear regardless of water availability, with the highest kernel set in the middle region and a gradual reduction toward the apical and basal ends. Water deficit limited silk elongation in a manner inverse to the temporal pattern of silk initiation, more strongly in the apical and basal regions of the ear than in the middle region. The limited recovery of silk elongation, especially at the apical and basal regions following rescue irrigation was probably due to water potentials below the threshold for elongation and lower growth rates of the associated ovaries. While sugar concentrations increased or did not respond to water deficit in ovaries and silks, the calculated sugar flux into the developing ovaries was impaired and diverged among ovaries at different positions under water deficit. Water deficit resulted in 58% kernel loss, 68% of which was attributable to arrested silks within husks caused by lower water potentials and 32% to ovaries with emerged silks possibly due to impaired carbohydrate metabolism."
38590166,photosynthetic rate; biomass yield; response to plant population,Photosynthetic capacity and assimilate transport of the lower canopy influence maize yield under high planting density.,"Photosynthesis is a major trait of interest for development of high-yield crop plants. However, little is known about the effects of high-density planting on photosynthetic responses at the whole-canopy level. Using the high-yielding maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars 'LY66', 'MC670', and 'JK968', we here conducted a two-year field experiment to assess ear development in addition to leaf characteristics and photosynthetic parameters in each canopy layer at four planting densities. Increased planting density promoted high grain yield and population-scale biomass accumulation despite reduced per-plant productivity. MC670 had the strongest adaptability to high-density planting conditions. Physiological analysis showed that increased planting density primarily led to decreases in the single-leaf area above the ear for LY66 and MC670 and below the ear for JK968. Furthermore, high planting density decreased chlorophyll content and the photosynthetic rate due to decreased canopy transmission, leading to severe decreases in single-plant biomass accumulation in the lower canopy. Moreover, increased planting density improved pre-silking biomass transfer, especially in the lower canopy. Yield showed significant positive relationships with photosynthesis and biomass in the lower canopy, demonstrating the important contributions of these leaves to grain yield under dense planting conditions. Increased planting density led to retarded ear development as a consequence of reduced glucose and fructose contents in the ears, indicating reductions in sugar transport that were associated with limited sink organ development, reduced kernel number, and yield loss. Overall, these findings highlighted the photosynthetic capacities of the lower canopy as promising targets for improving maize yield under dense planting conditions."
38590752,plant height; ear height,QTL mapping for plant height and ear height using bi-parental immortalized heterozygous populations in maize.,"Introduction: Plant height (PH) and ear height (EH) are key plant architectural traits in maize, which will affect the photosynthetic efficiency, high plant density tolerance, suitability for mechanical harvesting. 

Methods: QTL mapping were conducted for PH and EH using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and two corresponding immortalized backcross (IB) populations obtained from crosses between the RIL population and the two parental lines. 

Results: A total of 17 and 15 QTL were detected in the RIL and IB populations, respectively. Two QTL, qPH1-1 (qEH1-1) and qPH1-2 (qEH1-4) in the RIL, were simultaneously identified for PH and EH. Combing reported genome-wide association and cloned PH-related genes, co-expression network analyses were constructed, then five candidate genes with high confidence in major QTL were identified including Zm00001d011117 and Zm00001d011108, whose homologs have been confirmed to play a role in determining PH in maize and soybean. 

Discussion: QTL mapping used a immortalized backcross population is a new strategy. These identified genes in this study can provide new insights for improving the plant architecture in maize."
38593116,chlorophyll fluorescence: leaf,"Comparative characteristics of oat doubled haploids and oat × maize addition lines: Anatomical features of the leaves, chlorophyll a fluorescence and yield parameters.","As a result of oat (Avena sativa L.) × maize (Zea mays L.) crossing, maize chromosomes may not be completely eliminated at the early stages of embryogenesis, leading to the oat × maize addition (OMA) lines development. Introgression of maize chromosomes into oat genome can cause morphological and physiological modifications. The aim of the research was to evaluate the leaves' anatomy, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and yield parameter of oat doubled haploid (DH) and OMA lines obtained by oat × maize crossing. The present study examined two DH and two disomic OMA lines and revealed that they differ significantly in the majority of studied traits, apart from: the number of cells of the outer bundle sheath; light energy absorption; excitation energy trapped in PSII reaction centers; and energy dissipated from PSII. The OMA II line was characterized by larger size of single cells in the outer bundle sheath and greater number of seeds per plant among tested lines."
38607264,drought response,Autophagy receptor ZmNBR1 promotes the autophagic degradation of ZmBRI1a and enhances drought tolerance in maize.,"Drought stress is a crucial environmental factor that limits plant growth, development, and productivity. Autophagy of misfolded proteins can help alleviate the damage caused in plants experiencing drought. However, the mechanism of autophagy-mediated drought tolerance in plants remains largely unknown. Here, we cloned the gene for a maize (Zea mays) selective autophagy receptor, NEXT TO BRCA1 GENE 1 (ZmNBR1), and identified its role in the response to drought stress. We observed that drought stress increased the accumulation of autophagosomes. RNA sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that ZmNBR1 is markedly induced by drought stress. ZmNBR1 overexpression enhanced drought tolerance, while its knockdown reduced drought tolerance in maize. Our results established that ZmNBR1 mediates the increase in autophagosomes and autophagic activity under drought stress. ZmNBR1 also affects the expression of genes related to autophagy under drought stress. Moreover, we determined that BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1A (ZmBRI1a), a brassinosteroid receptor of the BRI1-like family, interacts with ZmNBR1. Phenotype analysis showed that ZmBRI1a negatively regulates drought tolerance in maize, and genetic analysis indicated that ZmNBR1 acts upstream of ZmBRI1a in regulating drought tolerance. Furthermore, ZmNBR1 facilitates the autophagic degradation of ZmBRI1a under drought stress. Taken together, our results reveal that ZmNBR1 regulates the expression of autophagy-related genes, thereby increasing autophagic activity and promoting the autophagic degradation of ZmBRI1a under drought stress, thus enhancing drought tolerance in maize. These findings provide new insights into the autophagy degradation of brassinosteroid signaling components by the autophagy receptor NBR1 under drought stress."
38607439,root morphology,Genomic basis determining root system architecture in maize.,"A total of 389 and 344 QTLs were identified by GWAS and QTL mapping explaining accumulatively 32.2-65.0% and 23.7-63.4% of phenotypic variation for 14 shoot-borne root traits using more than 1300 individuals across multiple field trails. Efficient nutrient and water acquisition from soils depends on the root system architecture (RSA). However, the genetic determinants underlying RSA in maize remain largely unexplored. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis for 14 shoot-borne root traits using 513 inbred lines and 800 individuals from four recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations at the mature stage across multiple field trails. Our analysis revealed substantial phenotypic variation for these 14 root traits, with a total of 389 and 344 QTLs identified through genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and linkage analysis, respectively. These QTLs collectively explained 32.2-65.0% and 23.7-63.4% of the trait variation within each population. Several a priori candidate genes involved in auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways, such as IAA26, ARF2, LBD37 and CKX3, were found to co-localize with these loci. In addition, a total of 69 transcription factors (TFs) from 27 TF families (MYB, NAC, bZIP, bHLH and WRKY) were found for shoot-borne root traits. A total of 19 genes including PIN3, LBD15, IAA32, IAA38 and ARR12 and 19 GWAS signals were overlapped with selective sweeps. Further, significant additive effects were found for root traits, and pyramiding the favorable alleles could enhance maize root development. These findings could contribute to understand the genetic basis of root development and evolution, and provided an important genetic resource for the genetic improvement of root traits in maize."
38626656,drought response; response to salt,"Two maize homologs of mammalian proton-coupled folate transporter, ZmMFS_1-62 and ZmMFS_1-73, are essential to salt and drought tolerance","Folates are essential to the maintenance of normal life activities in almost all organisms. Proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, is one of the three major folate transporter types widely studied in mammals. However, information about plant PCFTs is limited. Here, a genome-wide identification of maize PCFTs was performed, and two PCFTs, ZmMFS-1-62 and ZmMFS-1-73, were functionally investigated. Both proteins contained the typical 12 transmembrane helixes with N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm, and were localized in the plasma membrane. Molecular docking analysis indicated binding activity with folates via hydrogen bonding. Interference with ZmMFS-1-62 and ZmMFS-1-73 in maize seedlings through virus-induced gene silencing disrupted folate homeostasis, mainly in the roots, and reduced tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Moreover, a molecular chaperone protein, ZmHSP20, was found to interact with ZmMFS-1-62 and ZmMFS-1-73, and interference with ZmHSP20 in maize seedlings also led to folate disruption and increased sensitivity to drought and salt stresses. Overall, this is the first report of functional identification of maize PCFTs, which play essential roles in salt and drought stress tolerance, thereby linking folate metabolism with abiotic stress responses in maize. 
Highlights: 
    •    Proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) were firstly identified in plant genome. 
    •    Interference with two PCFT homologs ZmMFS-1-62 and ZmMFS- 1-73 in maize seedlings disrupted folate homeostasis. 
    •    Silencing ZmMFS_1-62 and ZmMFS_1-73 reduced the tolerance to drought and salt stresses. 
    •    The interaction of ZmMFS_1-62/-73 with HSP20 may maintain their stability and function under drought and salt stresses."
38633871,stalk lodging,Quantification of maize brace root formation after vertical stalk displacement.,"Maize brace roots develop from aboveground stem nodes in both upright and vertically displaced stalks. The cues that trigger brace root development after displacement are unknown. Possibilities include disturbance of the belowground roots, gravity, moisture, physical interaction, or node anatomical changes. We show that brace root formation occurs at all growth stages, with more nodes producing brace roots when plants are displaced at later growth stages. This occurs with the underground roots intact, without moisture accumulation and without physical interaction. We propose that the formation of brace roots after vertical stalk displacement is most likely due to gravity or anatomical changes at the node."
38636730,response to flooding,Genetic variations in ZmEREB179 are associated with waterlogging tolerance in maize,"Maize (Zea mays) is highly susceptible to waterlogging stress, which reduces both the yield and quality of this important crop. However, the molecular mechanism governing waterlogging tolerance is poorly understood. In this study, we identify a waterlogging- and ethylene-inducible gene ZmEREB179 that encodes an ethylene responsive factor (ERF) localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of ZmEREB179 in maize increases the sensitivity to waterlogging stress. Conversely, the zmereb179 knockout mutants are more tolerant to waterlogging, suggesting that ZmEREB179 functions as a negative regulator of waterlogging tolerance. A transcriptome analysis of the ZmEREB179-overexpressing plants reveals that the ERF-type transcription factor modulates the expression of various stress-related genes, including ZmEREB180. We find that ZmEREB179 directly targets the ZmEREB180 promoter and represses its expression. Notably, the analysis of a panel of 220 maize inbred lines reveals that genetic variations in the ZmEREB179 promoter (Hap2) are significantly associated with waterlogging resistance. The functional association of Hap2 with waterlogging resistance is tightly co-segretated in two F2 segregating populations, highlighting its potential applications in breeding programs. Our findings shed light on the involvement of the transcriptional cascade of ERFs in regulating plant waterlogging tolerance."
38642178,drought response,Characterization and expression profiles of the ZmLBD gene family in Zea mays.,"Background: The Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) gene family is a family of plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are widely involved in processes such as lateral organ formation, stress response, and nutrient metabolism. However, the function of LBD genes in maize remains poorly understood. 

Methods and results: In this study, a total of 49 ZmLBD genes were identified at the genome-wide level of maize, they were classified into nine branches based on phylogenetic relationships, and all of them were predicted to be nuclear localized. The 49 ZmLBD genes formed eight pairs of segmental duplicates, and members of the same branches' members had similar gene structure and conserved motif composition. The promoters of ZmLBD genes contain multiple types of cis-acting elements. In addition, by constructing the regulatory network of ZmLBD and other genes and miRNAs, 12 and 22 ZmLBDs were found to be involved in the gene regulatory network and miRNA regulatory network, respectively. The expression pattern analysis suggests that ZmLBD genes may be involved in different biological pathways, and drought stress induced the expressions of two inbred lines. 

Conclusions: The findings enhance our comprehension of the potential roles of the ZmLBD gene family in maize growth and development, which is pivotal for genetic enhancement and breeding efforts pertaining to this significant crop."
38649662,response to Fusarium stalk rot,Exploiting genomic tools for genetic dissection and improving the resistance to Fusarium stalk rot in tropical maize.,"A stable genomic region conferring FSR resistance at ~250 Mb on chromosome 1 was identified by GWAS. Genomic prediction has the potential to improve FSR resistance. Fusarium stalk rot (FSR) is a global destructive disease in maize; the efficiency of phenotypic selection for improving FSR resistance was low. Novel genomic tools of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction (GP) provide an opportunity for genetic dissection and improving FSR resistance. In this study, GWAS and GP analyses were performed on 562 tropical maize inbred lines consisting of two populations. In total, 15 SNPs significantly associated with FSR resistance were identified across two populations and the combinedPOP consisting of all 562 inbred lines, with the P-values ranging from 1.99 × 10-7 to 8.27 × 10-13, and the phenotypic variance explained (PVE) values ranging from 0.94 to 8.30%. The genetic effects of the 15 favorable alleles ranged from -4.29 to -14.21% of the FSR severity. One stable genomic region at ~ 250 Mb on chromosome 1 was detected across all populations, and the PVE values of the SNPs detected in this region ranged from 2.16 to 5.18%. Prediction accuracies of FSR severity estimated with the genome-wide SNPs were moderate and ranged from 0.29 to 0.51. By incorporating genotype-by-environment interaction, prediction accuracies were improved between 0.36 and 0.55 in different breeding scenarios. Considering both the genome coverage and the threshold of the P-value of SNPs to select a subset of molecular markers further improved the prediction accuracies. These findings extend the knowledge of exploiting genomic tools for genetic dissection and improving FSR resistance in tropical maize."
38660147,ear morphology,A novel framework for three-dimensional electrical impedance tomography reconstruction of maize ear via feature reconfiguration and residual networks.,"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides an indirect measure of the physiological state and growth of the maize ear by reconstructing the distribution of electrical impedance. However, the two-dimensional (2D) EIT within the electrode plane finds it challenging to comprehensively represent the spatial distribution of conductivity of the intact maize ear, including the husk, kernels, and cob. Therefore, an effective method for 3D conductivity reconstruction is necessary. In practical applications, fluctuations in the contact impedance of the maize ear occur, particularly with the increase in the number of grids and computational workload during the reconstruction of 3D spatial conductivity. These fluctuations may accentuate the ill-conditioning and nonlinearity of the EIT. To address these challenges, we introduce RFNetEIT, a novel computational framework specifically tailored for the absolute imaging of the three-dimensional electrical impedance of maize ear. This strategy transforms the reconstruction of 3D electrical conductivity into a regression process. Initially, a feature map is extracted from measured boundary voltage via a data reconstruction module, thereby enhancing the correlation among different dimensions. Subsequently, a nonlinear mapping model of the 3D spatial distribution of the boundary voltage and conductivity is established, utilizing the residual network. The performance of the proposed framework is assessed through numerical simulation experiments, acrylic model experiments, and maize ear experiments. Our experimental results indicate that our method yields superior reconstruction performance in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), structural similarity index (SSIM), and inverse problem-solving time (IPST). Furthermore, the reconstruction experiments on maize ears demonstrate that the method can effectively reconstruct the 3D conductivity distribution."
38661441,drought response; water use efficiency,Cortical parenchyma wall width regulates root metabolic cost and maize performance under suboptimal water availability.,"We describe how increased root cortical parenchyma wall width (CPW) can improve tolerance to drought stress in maize by reducing the metabolic costs of soil exploration. Significant variation (1.0 to 5.0 µm) for CPW was observed in maize germplasm. The functional-structural model RootSlice predicts that increasing CPW from 2 to 4 µm is associated with ca. 15% reduction in root cortical cytoplasmic volume, respiration rate, and nitrogen content. Analysis of genotypes with contrasting CPW grown with and without water stress in the field confirms that increased CPW is correlated with ca. 32 to 42% decrease in root respiration. Under water stress in the field, increased CPW is correlated with 125% increased stomatal conductance, 325% increased leaf CO2 assimilation rate, 73 to 78% increased shoot biomass, and 92 to 108% increased yield. CPW was correlated with leaf mesophyll midrib parenchyma wall width, indicating pleiotropy. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes underlying CPW. OpenSimRoot modeling predicts that a reduction in root respiration due to increased CPW would also benefit maize growth under suboptimal nitrogen, which requires empirical testing. We propose CPW as a new phene that has utility under edaphic stress meriting further investigation."
38662228,husk number,A combination of QTL mapping and genome-wide association study revealed the key gene for husk number in maize.,"Two key genes Zm00001d021232 and Zm00001d048138 were identified by QTL mapping and GWAS. Additionally, they were verified to be significantly associated with maize husk number (HN) using gene-based association study. As a by-product of maize production, maize husk is an important industrial raw material. Husk layer number (HN) is an important trait that affects the yield of maize husk. However, the genetic mechanism underlying HN remains unclear. Herein, a total of 13 quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling HN were identified in an IBM Syn 10 DH population across different locations. Among these, three QTL were individually repeatedly detected in at least two environments. Meanwhile, 26 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected to be significantly (p < 2.15 × 10-6) associated with HN in an association pool. Of these SNPs, three were simultaneously detected across multiple environments or environments and best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). We focused on these environment-stable and population-common genetic loci for excavating the candidate genes responsible for maize HN. Finally, 173 initial candidate genes were identified, of which 22 were involved in both multicellular organism development and single-multicellular organism process and thus confirmed as the candidate genes for HN. Gene-based association analyses revealed that the variants in four genes were significantly (p < 0.01/N) correlated with HN, of which Zm00001d021232 and Zm00001d048138 were highly expressed in husks and early developing ears among different maize tissues. Our study contributes to the understanding of genetic and molecular mechanisms of maize husk yield and industrial development in the future."
38664642,pericarp thickness,Genetic analysis and QTL mapping for pericarp thickness in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Proper pericarp thickness protects the maize kernel against pests and diseases, moreover, thinner pericarp improves the eating quality in fresh corn. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic changes in maize pericarp during kernel development and identified the major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for maize pericarp thickness. It was observed that maize pericarp thickness first increased and then decreased. During the growth and formation stages, the pericarp thickness gradually increased and reached the maximum, after which it gradually decreased and reached the minimum during maturity. To identify the QTLs for pericarp thickness, a BC4F4 population was constructed using maize inbred lines B73 (recurrent parent with thick pericarp) and Baimaya (donor parent with thin pericarp). In addition, a high-density genetic map was constructed using maize 10 K SNP microarray. A total of 17 QTLs related to pericarp thickness were identified in combination with the phenotypic data. The results revealed that the heritability of the thickness of upper germinal side of pericarp (UG) was 0.63. The major QTL controlling UG was qPT1-1, which was located on chromosome 1 (212,215,145-212,948,882). The heritability of the thickness of upper abgerminal side of pericarp (UA) was 0.70. The major QTL controlling UA was qPT2-1, which was located on chromosome 2 (2,550,197-14,732,993). In addition, a combination of functional annotation, DNA sequencing analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) screened two candidate genes, Zm00001d001964 and Zm00001d002283, that could potentially control maize pericarp thickness. This study provides valuable insights into the improvement of maize pericarp thickness during breeding."
38668992,response to heat stress,The complex transcriptional regulation of heat stress response in maize.,"As one of the most important food and feed crops worldwide, maize suffers much more tremendous damages under heat stress compared to other plants, which seriously inhibits plant growth and reduces productivity. To mitigate the heat-induced damages and adapt to high temperature environment, plants have evolved a series of molecular mechanisms to sense, respond and adapt high temperatures and heat stress. In this review, we summarized recent advances in molecular regulations underlying high temperature sensing, heat stress response and memory in maize, especially focusing on several important pathways and signals in high temperature sensing, and the complex transcriptional regulation of ZmHSFs (Heat Shock Factors) in heat stress response. In addition, we highlighted interactions between ZmHSFs and several epigenetic regulation factors in coordinately regulating heat stress response and memory. Finally, we laid out strategies to systematically elucidate the regulatory network of maize heat stress response, and discussed approaches for breeding future heat-tolerance maize."
38669308,drought response,Drought-induced circular RNAs in maize roots: separating signal from noise,"Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) play an important role in diverse biological processes; however, their origin and functions, especially in plants, remain largely unclear. Here, we used two maize (Zea mays) inbred lines, as well as 14 of their derivative RILs with different drought sensitivity, to systematically characterize 8,790 circRNAs in maize roots under well-watered (WW) and water-stress (WS) conditions. We found that a diverse set of circRNAs expressed at significantly higher levels under WS. Enhanced expression of circRNAs was associated with longer flanking introns and an enrichment of long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retrotransposable elements. The epigenetic marks found at the back-splicing junctions of circRNA-producing genes were markedly different from canonical splicing, characterized by increased levels of H3K36me3/H3K4me1, as well as decreased levels of H3K9Ac/H3K27Ac. We found that genes expressing circRNAs are subject to relaxed selection. The significant enrichment of trait-associated sites along their genic regions suggested that genes giving rise to circRNAs were associated with plant survival rate under drought stress, implying that circRNAs play roles in plant drought responses. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of circMED16, one of the drought-responsive circRNAs, enhances drought tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Our results provide a framework for understanding the intricate interplay of epigenetic modifications and how they contribute to the fine-tuning of circRNA expression under drought stress."
38671375,response to Colletotrichum graminicola,"Plant immunity suppression by an β-1,3-glucanase of the maize anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola.","Background: Many phytopathogens secrete a large number of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to decompose host cell walls in order to penetrate the host, obtain nutrients and accelerate colonization. There is a wide variety of CWDEs produced by plant pathogens, including glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which determine the virulence, pathogenicity, and host specificity of phytopathogens. The specific molecular mechanisms by which pathogens suppress host immunity remain obscure. 

Result: In this study, we found that CgEC124 encodes a glycosyl hydrolase with a signal peptide and a conserved Glyco_hydro_cc domain which belongs to glycoside hydrolase 128 family. The expression of CgEC124 was significantly induced in the early stage of Colletotrichum graminicola infection, especially at 12 hpi. Furthermore, CgEC124 positively regulated the pathogenicity, but it did not impact the vegetative growth of mycelia. Ecotopic transient expression of CgEC124 decreased the disease resistance and callose deposition in maize. Moreover, CgEC124 exhibited the β-1,3-glucanase activity and suppresses glucan-induced ROS burst in maize leaves. 

Conclusions: Our results indicate that CgEC124 is required for full virulence of C. graminicola but not for vegetative growth. CgEC124 increases maize susceptibility by inhibiting host reactive oxygen species burst as well as callose deposition. Meanwhile, our data suggests that CgEC124 explores its β-1,3-glucanase activity to prevent induction of host defenses."
38678554,carotenoid content,"ZmPTOX1, a plastid terminal oxidase, contributes to redox homeostasis during seed development and germination.","Maize plastid terminal oxidase1 (ZmPTOX1) plays a pivotal role in seed development by upholding redox balance within seed plastids. This study focuses on characterizing the white kernel mutant 3735 (wk3735) mutant, which yields pale-yellow seeds characterized by heightened protein but reduced carotenoid levels, along with delayed germination compared to wild-type (WT) seeds. We successfully cloned and identified the target gene ZmPTOX1, responsible for encoding maize PTOX-a versatile plastoquinol oxidase and redox sensor located in plastid membranes. While PTOX's established role involves regulating redox states and participating in carotenoid metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves and tomato fruits, our investigation marks the first exploration of its function in storage organs lacking a photosynthetic system. Through our research, we validated the existence of plastid-localized ZmPTOX1, existing as a homomultimer, and established its interaction with ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase 1 (ZmFNR1), a crucial component of the electron transport chain (ETC). This interaction contributes to the maintenance of redox equilibrium within plastids. Our findings indicate a propensity for excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wk3735 seeds. Beyond its known role in carotenoids' antioxidant properties, ZmPTOX1 also impacts ROS homeostasis owing to its oxidizing function. Altogether, our results underscore the critical involvement of ZmPTOX1 in governing seed development and germination by preserving redox balance within the seed plastids."
38678590,drought response; response to heat stress,Improving resilience to high temperature in drought: water replenishment enhances sucrose and amino acid metabolisms in maize grain.,"Heat stress poses a significant threat to maize, especially when combined with drought. Recent research highlights the potential of water replenishment to ameliorate grain weight loss. However, the mitigating mechanisms of heat in drought stress, especially during the crucial early grain-filling stage, remain poorly understood. We investigated the mechanism for mitigating heat in drought stress by water replenishment from the 12th to the 32nd days after silking in a controlled greenhouse experiment (Exp. I) and field trial (Exp. II). A significant reduction in grain weight was observed in heat stress compared to normal conditions. When water replenishment was applied to increase soil water content (SWC) under heat stress, the grain yield exhibited a notable increase ranging from 28.4 to 76.9%. XY335 variety was used for transcriptome sequencing to analyze starch biosynthesis and amino acid metabolisms in Exp. I. With water replenishment, the transcripts of genes responsible for trehalose 6-phosphate phosphates (TPP), alpha-trehalase (TRE), ADP-glcpyrophosphorylase, and starch synthase activity were stimulated. Additionally, the expression of genes encoding TPP and TRE contributed to an enhanced conversion of trehalose to glucose. This led to the conversion of sucrose from glucose-1-phosphate to ADP-glucose and ADP-glucose to amylopectin, ultimately increasing starch production by 45.1%. Water replenishment to boost SWC during heat stress also elevated the levels of essential amino acids in maize, including arginine, serine, tyrosine, leucine, glutamic acid, and methionine, providing valuable support to maize plants in adversity. Field trials further validated the positive impact of water replenishment on SWC, resulting in a notable increase in grain yield ranging from 7.1 to 9.2%. This study highlights the vital importance of adapting to abiotic stress and underscores the necessity of developing strategies to counteract its adverse effects on crop yield."
38686847,foliar senescence; disease response,"A maize enzyme from the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase family with unique kinetic properties, mediates resistance against pathogens and regulates senescence.","In plants, salicylic acid (SA) hydroxylation regulates SA homoeostasis, playing an essential role during plant development and response to pathogens. This reaction is catalysed by SA hydroxylase enzymes, which hydroxylate SA producing 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and/or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA). Several SA hydroxylases have recently been identified and characterised from different plant species, but no such activity has yet been reported in maize. In this work, we describe the identification and characterisation of a new SA hydroxylase in maize plants. This enzyme, with high sequence similarity to previously described SA hydroxylases from Arabidopsis and rice, converts SA into 2,5-DHBA; however, it has different kinetic properties to those of previously characterised enzymes, and it also catalysers the conversion of the flavonoid dihydroquercetin into quercetin in in vitro activity assays, suggesting that the maize enzyme may have different roles in vivo to those previously reported from other species. Despite this, ZmS5H can complement the pathogen resistance and the early senescence phenotypes of Arabidopsis s3h mutant plants. Finally, we characterised a maize mutant in the S5H gene (s5hMu) that has altered growth, senescence and increased resistance against Colletotrichum graminicola infection, showing not only alterations in SA and 2,5-DHBA but also in flavonol levels. Together, the results presented here provide evidence that SA hydroxylases in different plant species have evolved to show differences in catalytic properties that may be important to fine tune SA levels and other phenolic compounds such as flavonols, to regulate different aspects of plant development and pathogen defence."
38689962,disease response,A multi-scale feature fusion neural network for multi-class disease classification on the maize leaf images.,"Maize is a globally important cereal crop, however, maize leaf disease is one of the most common and devastating diseases that afflict it. Artificial intelligence methods face challenges in identifying and classifying maize leaf diseases due to variations in image quality, similarity among diseases, disease severity, limited dataset availability, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based multi-scale network (MResNet) for classifying multi-type maize leaf diseases from maize images. MResNet consists of two residual subnets with different scales, enabling the model to detect diseases in maize leaf images at different scales. We further utilize a hybrid feature weight optimization method to optimize and fuse the feature mapping weights of two subnets. We validate MResNet on a maize leaf diseases dataset. MResNet achieves 97.45% accuracy. The performance of MResNet surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. Various experiments and two additional datasets confirm the generalization performance of our model. Furthermore, thermodynamic diagram analysis increases the interpretability of the model. This study provides technical support for the disease classification of agricultural plants."
38694254,pollen viability,Identification of two plastid transit peptides for construction of pollen-inactivation system in rice.,"Hybrid seed production technology (SPT) is achieved through the utilization of a recessive nuclear male-sterile mutant transformed with a transgenic cassette comprising three essential components: the wild-type gene to restore the fertility of the male-sterile mutant, an α-amylase gene to disrupt transgenic pollen grains, and red fluorescence protein gene DsRed to distinguish the transgenic seeds from the nontransgenic male sterile seeds. In rice, we establish the pollen disruption system by introducing an amyloplast targeting signal peptide (ASP) at the N-terminus of maize α-amylase protein ZM-AA1ΔSP (ZM-AA1 with the N-terminal signal peptide removed). The ASP facilitates the transport of ZM-AA1ΔSP protein into amyloplast where it degrades starch, resulting in disruption of the pollen fertility. To obtain such signal peptides for rice, we searched the rice proteins homologous to the defined wheat amyloplast proteins followed by protein-protein interaction network predictions and targeting signal peptides prediction. These analyses enabled the identification of four candidate ASPs in rice, which were designated as ASP1, ASP2, ASP3, and ASP4, respectively. ASP1 and ASP2, when linked with ZM-AA1ΔSP, exhibited the capability to disrupt transgenic pollen grains, whereas ASP3 and ASP4 did not produce this effect. Interestingly, the localization experiments showed that ASP3 and ASP4 were able to target the proteins into chloroplast. The ASP1 and ASP2 sequences provide valuable tools for genetic engineering of the rice male-sterile system, which will contribute to the hybrid rice breeding and production."
38695630,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,ZmmiR398b negatively regulates maize resistance to sugarcane mosaic virus infection by targeting ZmCSD2/4/9.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in various biological processes of plants and contribute to plant resistance against various pathogens. In this study, upon sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) infection, the accumulation of maize (Zea mays) miR398b (ZmmiR398b) was significantly reduced in resistant inbred line Chang7-2, while it was increased in susceptible inbred line Mo17. Degradome sequencing analysis coupled with transient co-expression assays revealed that ZmmiR398b can target Cu/Zn-superoxidase dismutase2 (ZmCSD2), ZmCSD4, and ZmCSD9 in vivo, of which the expression levels were all upregulated by SCMV infection in Chang7-2 and Mo17. Moreover, overexpressing ZmmiR398b (OE398b) exhibited increased susceptibility to SCMV infection, probably by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which were consistent with ZmCSD2/4/9-silenced maize plants. By contrast, silencing ZmmiR398b (STTM398b) through short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology enhanced maize resistance to SCMV infection and decreased ROS levels. Interestingly, copper (Cu)-gradient hydroponic experiments demonstrated that Cu deficiency promoted SCMV infection while Cu sufficiency inhibited SCMV infection by regulating accumulations of ZmmiR398b and ZmCSD2/4/9 in maize. These results revealed that manipulating the ZmmiR398b-ZmCSD2/4/9-ROS module provides a prospective strategy for developing SCMV-tolerant maize varieties."
38702373,lesion formation; response to multiple leaf diseases,Maize leaf disease recognition using PRF-SVM integration: a breakthrough technique.,"The difficulty of collecting maize leaf lesion characteristics in an environment that undergoes frequent changes, suffers varying illumination from lighting sources, and is influenced by a variety of other factors makes detecting diseases in maize leaves difficult. It is critical to monitor and identify plant leaf diseases during the initial growing period to take suitable preventative measures. In this work, we propose an automated maize leaf disease recognition system constructed using the PRF-SVM model. The PRFSVM model was constructed by combining three powerful components: PSPNet, ResNet50, and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (Fuzzy SVM). The combination of PSPNet and ResNet50 not only assures that the model can capture delicate visual features but also allows for end-to-end training for smooth integration. Fuzzy SVM is included as a final classification layer to accommodate the inherent fuzziness and uncertainty in real-world image data. Five different maize crop diseases (common rust, southern rust, grey leaf spot, maydis leaf blight, and turcicum leaf blight along with healthy leaves) are selected from the Plant Village dataset for the algorithm's evaluation. The average accuracy achieved using the proposed method is approximately 96.67%. The PRFSVM model achieves an average accuracy rating of 96.67% and a mAP value of 0.81, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach for detecting and classifying various forms of maize leaf diseases."
38702564,ears per plant; baby corn yield,Unique genetic architecture of prolificacy in 'Sikkim Primitive' maize unraveled through whole-genome resequencing-based DNA polymorphism.,"'Sikkim Primitive' maize landrace, unique for prolificacy (7-9 ears per plant) possesses unique genomic architecture in branching and inflorescence-related gene(s), and locus Zm00001eb365210 encoding glycosyltransferases was identified as the putative candidate gene underlying QTL (qProl-SP-8.05) for prolificacy. The genotype possesses immense usage in breeding high-yielding baby-corn genotypes. 'Sikkim Primitive' is a native landrace of North Eastern Himalayas, and is characterized by having 7-9 ears per plant compared to 1-2 ears in normal maize. Though 'Sikkim Primitive' was identified in the 1960s, it has not been characterized at a whole-genome scale. Here, we sequenced the entire genome of an inbred (MGUSP101) derived from 'Sikkim Primitive' along with three non-prolific (HKI1128, UMI1200, and HKI1105) and three prolific (CM150Q, CM151Q and HKI323) inbreds. A total of 942,417 SNPs, 24,160 insertions, and 27,600 deletions were identified in 'Sikkim Primitive'. The gene-specific functional mutations in 'Sikkim Primitive' were classified as 10,847 missense (54.36%), 402 non-sense (2.015%), and 8,705 silent (43.625%) mutations. The number of transitions and transversions specific to 'Sikkim Primitive' were 666,021 and 279,950, respectively. Among all base changes, (G to A) was the most frequent (215,772), while (C to G) was the rarest (22,520). Polygalacturonate 4-α-galacturonosyltransferase enzyme involved in pectin biosynthesis, cell-wall organization, nucleotide sugar, and amino-sugar metabolism was found to have unique alleles in 'Sikkim Primitive'. The analysis further revealed the Zm00001eb365210 gene encoding glycosyltransferases as the putative candidate underlying QTL (qProl-SP-8.05) for prolificacy in 'Sikkim Primitive'. High-impact nucleotide variations were found in ramosa3 (Zm00001eb327910) and zeaxanthin epoxidase1 (Zm00001eb081460) genes having a role in branching and inflorescence development in 'Sikkim Primitive'. The information generated unraveled the genetic architecture and identified key genes/alleles unique to the 'Sikkim Primitive' genome. This is the first report of whole-genome characterization of the 'Sikkim Primitive' landrace unique for its high prolificacy."
38705046,drought response,Regulatory mechanisms used by ZmMYB39 to enhance drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays) seedlings.,"Drought is a significant abiotic stressor that limits maize (Zea mays L.) growth and development. Thus, enhancing drought tolerance is critical for promoting maize production. Our findings demonstrated that ZmMYB39 is an MYB transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. Drought stress experiments involving ZmMYB39 overexpression and knockout lines indicated that ZmMYB39 positively regulated drought stress tolerance in maize. DAP-Seq, EMSA, dual-LUC, and RT-qPCR provided initial insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms by which ZmMYB39 enhances drought tolerance in maize. ZmMYB39 directly promoted the expression of ZmP5CS1, ZmPOX1, ZmSOD2, ZmRD22, ZmNAC49, and ZmDREB2A, which are involved in stress resistance. ZmMYB39 enhanced drought tolerance by interacting with and promoting the expression of ZmFNR1, ZmHSP20, and ZmDOF6. Our study offers a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular regulatory networks involved in maize drought stress response. Furthermore, ZmMYB39 serves as a valuable genetic resource for breeding drought-resistant maize. 
Highlights: 
    •    ZmMYB39 is a MYB transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. 
    •    Overexpression of ZmMYB39 in maize significantly promotes drought tolerance. 
    •    ZmMYB39 promotes four downstream target genes (ZmRD22B, ZmDREB2A, ZmP5CS1 and ZmFNR1) expression for positively regulating drought tolerance in maize."
38705078,"response to low nitrogen; chlorophyll A, leaf below flag leaf; chlorophyll B, leaf below flag leaf",Genotype-specific nonphotochemical quenching responses to nitrogen deficit are linked to chlorophyll a to b ratios.,"Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) protects plants from photodamage caused by excess light energy. Substantial variation in NPQ has been reported among different genotypes of the same species. However, comparatively little is known about how environmental perturbations, including nutrient deficits, impact natural variation in NPQ kinetics. Here, we analyzed a natural variation in NPQ kinetics of a diversity panel of 225 maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes under nitrogen replete and nitrogen deficient field conditions. Individual maize genotypes from a diversity panel exhibited a range of changes in NPQ in response to low nitrogen. Replicated genotypes exhibited consistent responses across two field experiments conducted in different years. At the seedling and pre-flowering stages, a similar portion of the genotypes (∼33%) showed decrease, no-change or increase in NPQ under low nitrogen relative to control. Genotypes with increased NPQ under low nitrogen also showed greater reductions in dry biomass and photosynthesis than genotypes with stable NPQ when exposed to low nitrogen conditions. Maize genotypes where an increase in NPQ was observed under low nitrogen also exhibited a reduction in the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b. Our results underline that since thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy measured via NPQ helps to balance the energy absorbed with energy utilized, the NPQ changes are the reflection of broader molecular and biochemical changes which occur under the stresses such as low soil fertility. Here, we have demonstrated that variation in NPQ kinetics resulted from genetic and environmental factors, are not independent of each other. Natural genetic variation controlling plastic responses of NPQ kinetics to environmental perturbation increases the likelihood it will be possible to optimize NPQ kinetics in crop plants for different environments. 
Highlights: 
    •    Substantial variation in NPQ kinetics exists in maize on both low and control N. 
    •    In early and late-vegetative stages a similar portion of genotypes increased, no-change or decreased NPQmax in response to low N while in the post-flowering stage substantially more genotypes decreased NPQmax. 
    •    In low-nitrogen conditions, the NPQmax strongly correlates with shifts in Chl a/Chl b ratios."
38708398,haploid production,Haploid identification in maize,"Doubled haploid (DH) line production through in vivo maternal haploid induction is widely adopted in maize breeding programs. The established protocol for DH production includes four steps namely in vivo maternal haploid induction, haploid identification, genome doubling of haploid, and self-fertilization of doubled haploids. Since modern haploid inducers still produce relatively small portion of haploids among undesirable hybrid kernels, haploid identification is typically laborious, costly, and time-consuming, making this step the second foremost in the DH technique. This manuscript reviews numerous methods for haploid identification from different approaches including the innate differences in haploids and diploids, biomarkers integrated in haploid inducers, and automated seed sorting. The phenotypic differentiation, genetic basis, advantages, and limitations of each biomarker system are highlighted. Several approaches of automated seed sorting from different research groups are also discussed regarding the platform or instrument used, sorting time, accuracy, advantages, limitations, and challenges before they go through commercialization. The past haploid selection was focusing on finding the distinguishable marker systems with the key to effectiveness. The current haploid selection is adopting multiple reliable biomarker systems with the key to efficiency while seeking the possibility for automation. Fully automated high-throughput haploid sorting would be promising in near future with the key to robustness with retaining the feasible level of accuracy. The system that can meet between three major constraints (time, workforce, and budget) and the sorting scale would be the best option."
38710113,drought response,ZmASR1 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in maize,"Abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins in plants play a significant role in plant response to diverse abiotic stresses. However, the functions of ASR genes in maize remain unclear. In the present study, we identified a novel drought-induced ASR gene in maize (ZmASR1) and functionally characterized its role in mediating drought tolerance. The transcription of ZmASR1 was upregulated under drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, and the ZmASR1 protein was observed to exhibit nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Moreover, ZmASR1 knockout lines generated with the CRISPR–Cas9 system showed lower ROS accumulation, higher ABA content, and a higher degree of stomatal closure than wild-type plants, leading to higher drought tolerance. Transcriptome sequencing data indicated that the significantly differentially expressed genes in the drought treatment group were mainly enriched in ABA signal transduction, antioxidant defense, and photosynthetic pathway. Taken together, the findings suggest that ZmASR1 negatively regulates drought tolerance and represents a candidate gene for genetic manipulation of drought resistance in maize. 
Highlights: 
    •    A novel ASR gene was firstly cloned and characterize from maize; 
    •    ZmASR1 knockout lines showed enhanced drought stress tolerance in maize; 
    •    ZmASR1 knockout lines showed lower ROS accumulation, higher ABA content, and a higher degree of stomatal closure than wild-type plants."
38713242,response to gibberellin,Integrative transcriptome analysis uncovers common components containing CPS2 regulated by maize lncRNA GARR2 in gibberellin response.,"The combined transcriptome outcome provides an important clue to the regulatory cascade centering on lncRNA GARR2 and CPS2 gene in GA response. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as regulatory components in transcriptional hierarchy governing multiple aspects of biological processes. Dissecting regulatory mechanisms underpinning tetracyclic diterpenoid gibberellin (GA) cascade holds both theoretical and applied significance. However, roles of lncRNAs in transcriptional modulation of GA pathway remain largely elusive. Gypsy retrotransposon-derived GIBBERELLIN RESPONSIVE lncRNA2 (GARR2) has been reported as GA-responsive maize lncRNA. Here a novel GARR2-edited line garr2-1 was identified, characteristic of GA-induced phenotype of increased seedling height and elongated leaf sheath. Transcriptome analysis indicated that transcriptional abundance of five genes [ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase2 (CPS2), ent-kaurene synthase4 (KS4), ent-kaurene synthase6 (KS6), ent-kaurene oxidase2 (KO2), and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase1/Dwarf3 (KAO1/D3)] was elevated in garr2-1 for early steps of GA biosynthesis. Five GA biosynthetic genes as hub regulators were interlaced to shape regulatory network of GA response. Different transcriptome resources were integrated to discover common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the independent GARR2-edited lines GARR2KO and garr2-1. A total of 320 common DEGs were retrieved. These common DEGs were enriched in diterpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Integrative transcriptome analysis revealed the common CPS2 encoding the CPS enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the precursor trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate to ent-copalyl diphosphate. The up-regulated CPS2 supported the GA-induced phenotype of slender seedlings observed in the independent GARR2-edited lines GARR2KO and garr2-1. Our integrative transcriptome analysis uncovers common components of the GA pathway regulated by lncRNA GARR2. These common components, especially for the GA biosynthetic gene CPS2, provide a valuable resource for further delineating the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA GARR2 in GA response."
38716342,response to multiple leaf diseases,LFMNet: a lightweight model for identifying leaf diseases of maize with high similarity.,"Maize leaf diseases significantly impact yield and quality. However, recognizing these diseases from images taken in natural environments is challenging due to complex backgrounds and high similarity of disease spots between classes.This study proposes a lightweight multi-level attention fusion network (LFMNet) which can identify maize leaf diseases with high similarity in natural environment. The main components of LFMNet are PMFFM and MAttion blocks, with three key improvements relative to existing essential blocks. First, it improves the adaptability to the change of maize leaf disease scale through the dense connection of partial convolution with different expansion rates and reduces the parameters at the same time. The second improvement is that it replaces a adaptable pooling kernel according to the size of the input feature map on the original PPA, and the convolution layer to reshape to enhance the feature extraction of maize leaves under complex background. The third improvement is that it replaces different pooling kernels to obtain features of different scales based on GMDC and generate feature weighting matrix to enhance important regional features. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the LFMNet model on the test dataset reaches 94.12%, which is better than the existing heavyweight networks, such as ResNet50 and Inception v3, and lightweight networks such as DenseNet 121,MobileNet(V3-large) and ShuffleNet V2. The number of parameters is only 0.88m, which is better than the current mainstream lightweight network. It is also effective to identify the disease types with similar disease spots in leaves."
38720461,leaf angle,Histological and Single-nucleus Transcriptome Analyses Unveil the Specialized Functions of Ligular Sclerenchyma Cells and Key Regulators of Leaf Angle in Maize.,"Leaf angle (LA) is a crucial factor affecting planting density and yield in maize. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying LA formation remain largely unknown. In this study, we conducted a comparative histological analysis of the ligular region across various maize inbred lines, revealing that LA size is significantly influenced by a two-step regulatory process involving initial cell elongation followed by subsequent lignification in the ligular adaxial sclerenchyma cells (SC). We performed both bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, generated a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of the ligular region, and identified numerous genes enriched in the hypodermal cells that may influence their specialization into SC. Furthermore, we functionally characterized two genes encoding atypical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, bHLH30 and its homolog bHLH155, respectively, which are highly expressed in the elongated adaxial cells. Genetic analyses revealed that bHLH30 and bHLH155 positively regulate LA expansion, and molecular experiments demonstrated their ability to activate the transcription of genes involved in cell elongation and lignification of SC. These findings highlight the specialized functions of ligular adaxial SC in LA regulation by restricting the further extension of ligular cells and enhancing mechanical strength. The transcriptomic atlas of ligular region at single -nucleus resolution not only deepens our understanding of LA regulation but also identifies numerous potential targets for optimizing plant architecture in modern maize breeding. 
Short Summary: 
The comparative histological analyses have revealed the specialized functions of ligular adaxial sclerenchyma cells in regulating leaf angle by providing mechanical strength and limiting cell elongation. Additionally, we generated a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of the ligular region and validated the positive role of bHLH30 and its homolog, bHLH155, in the expansion of leaf angle in maize."
38723745,plant height,PURINE PERMEASE 4 regulates plant height in maize.,"Mutations of the ZmPUP4 gene in maize or overexpression of ZmPUP4 in Arabidopsis significantly impact plant height. Similarly, rice bg3-D, characterized by activation of OsPUP4, results in increased plant height. These results highlight the potential for leveraging complete or partial loss of PUP4 function in genetically modifying plant height, not only in maize but also in other crops such as sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and beyond."
38727957,response to Aspergillus flavus,MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling of maize genotypes with differential response to Aspergillus flavus implies zma-miR156-squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP) and zma-miR398/zma-miR394-F -box combinations involved in resistance mechanisms.,"Maize (Zea mays), a major food crop worldwide, is susceptible to infection by the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus flavus that can produce the carcinogenic metabolite aflatoxin (AF) especially under climate change induced abiotic stressors that favor mold growth. Several studies have used ""-omics"" approaches to identify genetic elements with potential roles in AF resistance, but there is a lack of research identifying the involvement of small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in maize-A. flavus interaction. In this study, we compared the miRNA profiles of three maize lines (resistant TZAR102, moderately resistant MI82, and susceptible Va35) at 8 h, 3 d, and 7 d after A. flavus infection to investigate possible regulatory antifungal role of miRNAs. A total of 316 miRNAs (275 known and 41 putative novel) belonging to 115 miRNA families were identified in response to the fungal infection across all three maize lines. Eighty-two unique miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed with 39 miRNAs exhibiting temporal differential regulation irrespective of the maize genotype, which targeted 544 genes (mRNAs) involved in diverse molecular functions. The two most notable biological processes involved in plant immunity, namely cellular responses to oxidative stress (GO:00345990) and reactive oxygen species (GO:0034614) were significantly enriched in the resistant line TZAR102. Coexpression network analysis identified 34 hubs of miRNA-mRNA pairs where nine hubs had a node in the module connected to their target gene with potentially important roles in resistance/susceptible response of maize to A. flavus. The miRNA hubs in resistance modules (TZAR102 and MI82) were mostly connected to transcription factors and protein kinases. Specifically, the module of miRNA zma-miR156b-nb - squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP), zma-miR398a-3p - SKIP5, and zma-miR394a-5p - F-box protein 6 combinations in the resistance-associated modules were considered important candidates for future functional studies."
38741087,drought response,Comprehensive identification of maize ZmE2F transcription factors and the positive role of ZmE2F6 in response to drought stress,"Background: The early 2 factor (E2F) family is characterized as a kind of transcription factor that plays an important role in cell division, DNA damage repair, and cell size regulation. However, its stress response has not been well revealed. 
Results: In this study, ZmE2F members were comprehensively identified in the maize genome, and 21 ZmE2F genes were identified, including eight E2F subclade members, seven DEL subfamily genes, and six DP genes. All ZmE2F proteins possessed the DNA-binding domain (DBD) characterized by conserved motif 1 with the RRIYD sequence. The ZmE2F genes were unevenly distributed on eight maize chromosomes, showed diversity in gene structure, expanded by gene duplication, and contained abundant stress-responsive elements in their promoter regions. Subsequently, the ZmE2F6 gene was cloned and functionally verified in drought response. The results showed that the ZmE2F6 protein interacted with ZmPP2C26, localized in the nucleus, and responded to drought treatment. The overexpression of ZmE2F6 enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis with longer root length, higher survival rate, and biomass by upregulating stress-related gene transcription. 
Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into a greater understanding and functional study of the E2F family in the stress response."
38743909,response to cold stress,Molecular mechanisms underlying low temperature inhibition of grain filling in maize (Zea mays L.): coordination of growth and cold responses.,"Low temperature (LT) greatly restricts grain filling in maize (Zea mays L.), but the relevant molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. To better understand the effect of LT on grain development, 17 hybrids were subjected to LT stress in field trials over 3 years, and two hybrids of them with contrasting LT responses were exposed to 30/20°C and 20/10°C for 7 days during grain filling in a greenhouse. At LT, thousand-kernel weight declined, especially in LT-sensitive hybrid FM985, while grain-filling rate was on average about 48% higher in LT-tolerant hybrid DK159 than FM985. LT reduced starch synthesis in kernel mainly by suppression of transcript levels and enzyme activities for sucrose synthase and hexokinase. Brassinolide (BR) was abundant in DK159 kernel, and genes involved in BR and cytokinin signals were inducible by stress. LT downregulated the genes in light-harvesting complex and photosystem I/II subunits, accompanied by reduced photosynthetic rate and Fv/Fm in ear leaf. The LT-tolerant hybrid could maintain a high soluble sugar content and fast interconversion between sucrose and hexose in the stem internode and cob, improving assimilate allocation to kernel at LT stress and paving the way for simultaneous growth and LT stress responses."
38745100,ear development,A spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear,"A comprehensive understanding of inflorescence development is crucial for crop genetic improvement, as inflorescence meristems give rise to reproductive organs and determine grain yield. However, dissecting inflorescence development at the cellular level has been challenging owing to a lack of specific marker genes to distinguish among cell types, particularly in different types of meristems that are vital for organ formation. In this study, we used spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) to construct a precise spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear primordium, identifying 12 cell types, including 4 newly defined cell types found mainly in the inflorescence meristem. By extracting the meristem components for detailed clustering, we identified three subtypes of meristem and validated two MADS-box genes that were specifically expressed at the apex of determinate meristems and involved in stem cell determinacy. Furthermore, by integrating single-cell RNA transcriptomes, we identified a series of spatially specific networks and hub genes that may provide new insights into the formation of different tissues. In summary, this study provides a valuable resource for research on cereal inflorescence development, offering new clues for yield improvement."
38745883,Abiotic stress response,Genome-wide identification and analyses of ZmAPY genes reveal their roles involved in maize development and abiotic stress responses.,"Apyrase is a class of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates (NTP/NDP), which widely involved in regulation of plant growth and stress responses. However, apyrase family genes in maize have not been identified, and their characteristics and functions are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 16 apyrases (named as ZmAPY1-ZmAPY16) in maize genome, and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, chromosomal distribution, upstream regulatory transcription factors and expression patterns. Analysis of the transcriptome database unveiled tissue-specific and abiotic stress-responsive expression of ZmAPY genes in maize. qPCR analysis further confirmed their responsiveness to drought, heat, and cold stresses. Association analyses indicated that variations of ZmAPY5 and ZmAPY16 may regulate maize agronomic traits and drought responses. Our findings shed light on the molecular characteristics and evolutionary history of maize apyrase genes, highlighting their roles in various biological processes and stress responses. This study forms a basis for further exploration of apyrase functions in maize."
38745920,response to salt,Identification and characterization of ACR gene family in maize for salt stress tolerance.,"Background: Members of the ACR gene family are commonly involved in various physiological processes, including amino acid metabolism and stress responses. In recent decades, significant progress has been made in the study of ACR genes in plants. However, little is known about their characteristics and function in maize. 

Methods: In this study, ACR genes were identified from the maize genome, and their molecular characteristics, gene structure, gene evolution, gene collinearity analysis, cis-acting elements were analyzed. qRT-PCR technology was used to verify the expression patterns of the ZmACR gene family in different tissues under salt stress. In addition, Ectopic expression technique of ZmACR5 in Arabidopsis thaliana was utilized to identify its role in response to salt stress. 

Results: A total of 28 ZmACR genes were identified, and their molecular characteristics were extensively described. Two gene pairs arising from segmented replication events were detected in maize, and 18 collinear gene pairs were detected between maize and 3 other species. Through phylogenetic analysis, three subgroups were revealed, demonstrating distinct divergence between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Analysis of ZmACR cis-acting elements revealed the optional involvement of ZmACR genes in light response, hormone response and stress resistance. Expression analysis of 8 ZmACR genes under salt treatment clearly revealed their role in the response to salt stress. Ectopic overexpression of ZmACR5 in Arabidopsis notably reduced salt tolerance compared to that of the wild type under salt treatment, suggesting that ZmACR5 has a negative role in the response to salt stress. 

Conclusion: Taken together, these findings confirmed the involvement of ZmACR genes in regulating salt stress and contributed significantly to our understanding of the molecular function of ACR genes in maize, facilitating further research in this field."
38747469,drought response,ZmABF4-ZmVIL2/ZmFIP37 module enhances drought tolerance in maize seedlings.,"Drought, as a primary environmental factor, imposes significant constraints on developmental processes and productivity of plants. PHDs were identified as stress-responsive genes in a wide range of eukaryotes. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing PHD genes in maize under abiotic stress conditions are still largely unknown and require further investigation. Here, we identified a mutant, zmvil2, in the EMS mutant library with a C to T mutation in the exon of the Zm00001d053875 (VIN3-like protein 2, ZmVIL2), resulting in premature termination of protein coding. ZmVIL2 belongs to PHD protein family. Compared to WT, zmvil2 mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to drought stress. Consistently, overexpression of ZmVIL2 enhances drought resistance in maize. Y2H, BiFC, and Co-IP experiments revealed that ZmVIL2 directly interacts with ZmFIP37 (FKBP12-interacting protein of 37). zmfip37 knockout mutants also exhibit decreased drought tolerance. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ZmABF4 directly binds to the ZmVIL2 promoter to enhance its activity in yeast one hybrid (Y1H), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and dual luciferase reporter assays. Therefore, we uncovered a novel model ZmABF4-ZmVIL2/ZmFIP37 that promotes drought tolerance in maize. Overall, these findings have enriched the knowledge of the functions of PHD genes in maize and provides genetic resources for breeding stress-tolerant maize varieties."
38750241,drought response,Transcription factor ZmDof22 enhances drought tolerance by regulating stomatal movement and antioxidant enzymes activities in maize (Zea mays L.).,"The Dof22 gene encoding a deoxyribonucleic acid binding with one finger in maize, which is associated with its drought tolerance. The identification of drought stress regulatory genes is essential for the genetic improvement of maize yield. Deoxyribonucleic acid binding with one finger (Dof), a plant-specific transcription factor family, is involved in signal transduction, morphogenesis, and environmental stress responses. In present study, by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene co-expression network analysis, 15 putative Dof genes were identified from maize that respond to drought and rewatering. A real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that these 15 genes were strongly induced by drought and ABA treatment, and among them ZmDof22 was highly induced by drought and ABA treatment. Its expression level increased by nearly 200 times after drought stress and more than 50 times after ABA treatment. After the normal conditions were restored, the expression levels were nearly 100 times and 40 times of those before treatment, respectively. The Gal4-LexA/UAS system and transcriptional activation analysis indicate that ZmDof22 is a transcriptional activator regulating drought tolerance and recovery ability in maize. Further, overexpressed transgenic and mutant plants of ZmDof22 by CRISPR/Cas9, indicates that the ZmDof22, improves maize drought tolerance by promoting stomatal closure, reduces water loss, and enhances antioxidant enzyme activity by participating in the ABA pathways. Taken together, our findings laid a foundation for further functional studies of the ZmDof gene family and provided insights into the role of the ZmDof22 regulatory network in controlling drought tolerance and recovery ability of maize."
38750515,response to cold stress,Maize miRNAs and their putative target genes involved in chilling stress response in 5-day old seedlings.,"Background: In the context of early sowing of maize as a promising adaptation strategy that could significantly reduce the negative effects of climate change, an in-depth understanding of mechanisms underlying plant response to low-temperature stress is demanded. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as key regulators of plant stress response, research on their role in chilling tolerance of maize during early seedling stages is scarce. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore chilling-responsive miRNAs, reveal their expression patterns and associated target genes, as well as to examine the possible functions of the conserved and novel miRNAs. In this study, the role of miRNAs was examined in 5d-old maize seedlings of one tolerant and one sensitive inbred line exposed to chilling (10/8 °C) stress for 6 h and 24 h, by applying high throughput sequencing. 

Results: A total of 145 annotated known miRNAs belonging to 30 families and 876 potentially novel miRNAs were identified. Differential expression (DE) analysis between control and stress conditions identified 98 common miRNAs for both genotypes at one time point and eight miRNAs at both time points. Target prediction and enrichment analysis showed that the DE zma-miR396, zma-miR156, zma-miR319, and zma-miR159 miRNAs modulate growth and development. Furthermore, it was found that several other DE miRNAs were involved in abiotic stress response: antioxidative mechanisms (zma-miR398), signal transduction (zma-miR156, zma-miR167, zma-miR169) and regulation of water content (zma-miR164, zma-miR394, zma-miR396). The results underline the zma-miRNAs involvement in the modulation of their target genes expression as an important aspect of the plant's survival strategy and acclimation to chilling stress conditions. 

Conclusions: To our understanding, this is the first study on miRNAs in 5-d old seedlings' response to chilling stress, providing data on the role of known and novel miRNAs post-transcriptional regulation of expressed genes and contributing a possible platform for further network and functional analysis."
38751035,drought response,Ca2+-independent ZmCPK2 is inhibited by Ca2+-dependent ZmCPK17 during drought response in maize.,"Calcium oscillations are induced by different stresses. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs/CPKs) are one major group of the plant calcium decoders that are involved in various processes including drought response. Some CPKs are calcium-independent. Here, we identified ZmCPK2 as a negative regulator of drought resistance by screening an overexpression transgenic maize pool. We found that ZmCPK2 does not bind calcium, and its activity is mainly inhibited during short term abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, and dynamically changed in prolonged treatment. Interestingly, ZmCPK2 interacts with and is inhibited by calcium-dependent ZmCPK17, a positive regulator of drought resistance, which is activated by ABA. ZmCPK17 could prevent the nuclear localization of ZmCPK2 through phosphorylation of ZmCPK2T60. ZmCPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates and activates ZmYAB15, a negative transcriptional factor for drought resistance. Our results suggest that drought stress-induced Ca2+ can be decoded directly by ZmCPK17 that inhibits ZmCPK2, thereby promoting plant adaptation to water deficit."
38754490,response to salt,Green-synthesized lignin nanoparticles enhance Zea mays resilience to salt stress by improving antioxidant metabolism and mitigating ultrastructural damage.,"Soil salinity poses a substantial threat to agricultural productivity, resulting in far-reaching consequences. Green-synthesized lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as significant biopolymers which effectively promote sustainable crop production and enhance abiotic stress tolerance. However, the defensive role and underlying mechanisms of LNPs against salt stress in Zea mays remain unexplored. The present study aims to elucidate two aspects: firstly, the synthesis of lignin nanoparticles from alkali lignin, which were characterized using field emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The results confirmed the purity and morphology of LNPs. Secondly, the utilization of LNPs (200 mg/L) in nano priming to alleviate the adverse effects of NaCl (150 mM) on Zea mays seedlings. LNPs significantly reduced the accumulation of Na+ (17/21%) and MDA levels (21/28%) in shoots/roots while increased lignin absorption (30/31%), resulting in improved photosynthetic performance and plant growth. Moreover, LNPs substantially improved plant biomass, antioxidant enzymatic activities and upregulated the expression of salt-tolerant genes (ZmNHX3 (1.52 & 2.81 FC), CBL (2.83 & 3.28 FC), ZmHKT1 (2.09 & 4.87 FC) and MAPK1 (3.50 & 2.39 FC) in both shoot and root tissues. Additionally, SEM and TEM observations of plant tissues confirmed the pivotal role of LNPs in mitigating NaCl-induced stress by reducing damages to guard cells, stomata and ultra-cellular structures. Overall, our findings highlight the efficacy of LNPs as a practical and cost-effective approach to alleviate NaCl-induced stress in Zea mays plants. These results offer a sustainable agri-environmental strategy for mitigating salt toxicity and enhancing crop production in saline environments."
38758970,response to heat stress,Regulatory role of AGC genes in heat stress adaptation in maize (Zea mays).,"Heat stress represents a significant environmental challenge that restricts maize (Zea mays ) growth and yield on a global scale. Within the plant kingdom, the AGC gene family, encoding a group of protein kinases, has emerged as crucial players in various stress responses. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of AGC genes in Z. mays under heat-stress conditions remains elusive. A genome-wide analysis was done using bioinformatics techniques to identify 39 AGC genes in Z. mays , categorising them into three subfamilies based on their conserved domains. We investigated their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures (including intron-exon configurations), and expression patterns. These genes are likely involved in diverse signalling pathways, fulfilling distinct roles when exposed to heat stress conditions. Notably, most ZmAGC1.5, ZmAGC1.9, ZmNDR3, ZmNDR5 and ZmIRE3 exhibited significant changes in expression levels under heat stress, featuring a high G-box ratio. Furthermore, we pinpointed a subset of AGC genes displaying highly coordinated expression, implying their potential involvement in the heat stress response pathway. Our study offers valuable insights into the contribution of AGC genes to Z. mays 's heat stress response, thus facilitating the development of heat-tolerant Z. mays varieties."
38761386,seed vigor,A genome-wide association study uncovers a ZmRap2.7-ZCN9/ZCN10 module to regulate ABA signalling and seed vigour in maize.,"Seed vigour, including rapid, uniform germination and robust seedling establishment under various field conditions, is becoming an increasingly essential agronomic trait for achieving high yield in crops. However, little is known about this important seed quality trait. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study to identify a key transcription factor ZmRap2.7, which regulates seed vigour through transcriptionally repressing expressions of three ABA signalling genes ZmPYL3, ZmPP2C and ZmABI5 and two phosphatidylethanolamine-binding genes ZCN9 and ZCN10. In addition, ZCN9 and ZCN10 proteins could interact with ZmPYL3, ZmPP2C and ZmABI5 proteins, and loss-of-function of ZmRap2.7 and overexpression of ZCN9 and ZCN10 reduced ABA sensitivity and seed vigour, suggesting a complex regulatory network for regulation of ABA signalling mediated seed vigour. Finally, we showed that four SNPs in ZmRap2.7 coding region influenced its transcriptionally binding activity to the downstream gene promoters. Together with previously identified functional variants within and surrounding ZmRap2.7, we concluded that the distinct allelic variations of ZmRap2.7 were obtained independently during maize domestication and improvement, and responded separately for the diversities of seed vigour, flowering time and brace root development. These results provide novel genes, a new regulatory network and an evolutional mechanism for understanding the molecular mechanism of seed vigour."
38776257,grain yield; plant height,Field-based high-throughput phenotyping enhances phenomic and genomic predictions for grain yield and plant height across years in maize.,"Field-based phenomic prediction employs novel features, like vegetation indices (VIs) from drone images, to predict key agronomic traits in maize, despite challenges in matching biomarker measurement time points across years or environments. This study utilized functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to summarize the variation of temporal VIs, uniquely allowing the integration of this data into phenomic prediction models tested across multiple years (2018-2021) and environments. The models, which included 1 genomic, 2 phenomic, 2 multikernel, and 1 multitrait type, were evaluated in 4 prediction scenarios (CV2, CV1, CV0, and CV00), relevant for plant breeding programs, assessing both tested and untested genotypes in observed and unobserved environments. Two hybrid populations (415 and 220 hybrids) demonstrated the visible atmospherically resistant index's strong temporal correlation with grain yield (up to 0.59) and plant height. The first 2 FPCAs explained 59.3 ± 13.9% and 74.2 ± 9.0% of the temporal variation of temporal data of VIs, respectively, facilitating predictions where flight times varied. Phenomic data, particularly when combined with genomic data, often were comparable to or numerically exceeded the base genomic model in prediction accuracy, particularly for grain yield in untested hybrids, although no significant differences in these models' performance were consistently observed. Overall, this approach underscores the effectiveness of FPCA and combined models in enhancing the prediction of grain yield and plant height across environments and diverse agricultural settings."
38778242,root morphology,Seedling root system adaptation to water availability during maize domestication and global expansion,"The maize root system has been reshaped by indirect selection during global adaptation to new agricultural environments. In this study, we characterized the root systems of more than 9,000 global maize accessions and its wild relatives, defining the geographical signature and genomic basis of variation in seminal root number. We demonstrate that seminal root number has increased during maize domestication followed by a decrease in response to limited water availability in locally adapted varieties. By combining environmental and phenotypic association analyses with linkage mapping, we identified genes linking environmental variation and seminal root number. Functional characterization of the transcription factor ZmHb77 and in silico root modeling provides evidence that reshaping root system architecture by reducing the number of seminal roots and promoting lateral root density is beneficial for the resilience of maize seedlings to drought."
38781209,root development,ZmPILS6 is an auxin efflux carrier required for maize root morphogenesis.,"Plant root systems play a pivotal role in plant physiology and exhibit diverse phenotypic traits. Understanding the genetic mechanisms governing root growth and development in model plants like maize is crucial for enhancing crop resilience to drought and nutrient limitations. This study focused on identifying and characterizing ZmPILS6, an annotated auxin efflux carrier, as a key regulator of various crown root traits in maize. ZmPILS6-modified roots displayed reduced network area and suppressed lateral root formation, which are desirable traits for the ""steep, cheap, and deep"" ideotype. The research revealed that ZmPILS6 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a vital role in controlling the spatial distribution of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or ""auxin"") in primary roots. The study also demonstrated that ZmPILS6 can actively efflux IAA when expressed in yeast. Furthermore, the loss of ZmPILS6 resulted in significant proteome remodeling in maize roots, particularly affecting hormone signaling pathways. To identify potential interacting partners of ZmPILS6, a weighted gene coexpression analysis was performed. Altogether, this research contributes to the growing knowledge of essential genetic determinants governing maize root morphogenesis, which is crucial for guiding agricultural improvement strategies. 
Significance: 
Roots are a key organ for water and nutrient uptake in plants. Changes in root architecture can impact yield and resilience to stress in crops. To find factors that contribute to root development in corn, a genetic screen was performed. Herein, we identify a hormone transporter that influences numerous root traits of agronomic significance. This work has implications for translational approaches aimed at improving cereal crops."
38781969,wound response,Peptide REF1 is a local wound signal promoting plant regeneration.,"Plants frequently encounter wounding and have evolved an extraordinary regenerative capacity to heal the wounds. However, the wound signal that triggers regenerative responses has not been identified. Here, through characterization of a tomato mutant defective in both wound-induced defense and regeneration, we demonstrate that in tomato, a plant elicitor peptide (Pep), REGENERATION FACTOR1 (REF1), acts as a systemin-independent local wound signal that primarily regulates local defense responses and regenerative responses in response to wounding. We further identified PEPR1/2 ORTHOLOG RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (PORK1) as the receptor perceiving REF1 signal for plant regeneration. REF1-PORK1-mediated signaling promotes regeneration via activating WOUND-INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1), a master regulator of wound-induced cellular reprogramming in plants. Thus, REF1-PORK1 signaling represents a conserved phytocytokine pathway to initiate, amplify, and stabilize a signaling cascade that orchestrates wound-triggered organ regeneration. Application of REF1 provides a simple method to boost the regeneration and transformation efficiency of recalcitrant crops. 
Highlights: 
    •    REF1 is a systemin-independent local wound signal promoting regenerative responses 
    •    REF1 is perceived by the receptor PORK1 for plant regeneration 
    •    REF1-PORK1 promotes regeneration via activating the master transcription factor WIND1 
    •    REF1 offers a simple method to boost the regeneration efficiency of recalcitrant crops"
38789817,Stress response,"Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the universal stress protein (USP) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa.","The Universal Stress Protein (USP) primarily participates in cellular responses to biotic and abiotic stressors, playing a pivotal role in plant growth, development, and Stress responses to adverse environmental conditions. Totals of 23, 26 and 26 USP genes were recognized in Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa, respectively. According to USP genes physicochemical properties, proteins from USP I class were identified as hydrophilic proteins with high stability. Based on phylogenetic analysis, USP genes family were classified into nine groups, USP II were rich in motifs. Additionally, members of the same subgroup exhibited similar numbers of introns/exons, and shared conserved domains, indicating close evolutionary relationships. Motif analysis results demonstrated a high degree of conservation among USP genes. Chromosomal distribution suggested that USP genes might have undergone gene expansion through segmental duplication in Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa. Most Ka/Ks ratios were found to be less than 1, suggesting that USP genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa have experienced purifying selection. Expression profile analysis revealed that USP genes primarily respond to drought stress in Oryza sativa, temperature, and drought stress in Zea mays, and cold stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene collinearity analysis can reveal correlations between genes, aiding subsequent in-depth investigations. This study sheds new light on the evolution of USP genes in monocots and dicots and lays the foundation for a better understanding of the biological functions of the USP genes family."
38801745,photosynthetic efficiency,"COI1 F-box proteins regulate DELLA protein levels, growth, and photosynthetic efficiency in maize.","The F-box protein Coronatine Insensitive (COI) is a receptor for the jasmonic acid signaling pathway in plants. To investigate the functions of the six maize (Zea mays) COI proteins (COI1a, COI1b, COI1c, COI1d, COI2a, and COI2b), we generated single, double, and quadruple loss-of-function mutants. The pollen of the coi2a coi2b double mutant was inviable. The coi1 quadruple mutant (coi1-4x) exhibited shorter internodes, decreased photosynthesis, leaf discoloration, microelement deficiencies, and accumulation of DWARF8 and/or DWARF9, two DELLA family proteins that repress the gibberellic acid signaling pathway. Co-expression of COI and DELLA in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that the COI proteins trigger proteasome-dependent DELLA degradation. Many genes that are downregulated in the coi1-4x mutant are gibberellic acid-inducible. In addition, most of the proteins encoded by the downregulated genes are predicted to be bundle sheath- or mesophyll-enriched, including those encoding C4-specific photosynthetic enzymes. Heterologous expression of maize Coi genes in N. benthamiana showed that COI2a is nucleus-localized and interacts with maize jasmonate ZIM (zinc-finger inflorescence meristem) domain (JAZ) proteins, the canonical COI repressor partners. However, maize COI1a and COI1c showed only partial nuclear localization and reduced binding efficiency to the tested JAZ proteins. Together, these results show the divergent functions of the six COI proteins in regulating maize growth and defense pathways."
38804053,ear length,The additive function of YIGE2 and YIGE1 in regulating maize ear length.,"Ear length (EL) is a key trait that greatly contributes to yield in maize. Although dozens of EL quantitative trait loci have been mapped, very few causal genes have been cloned, and the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Our previous study showed that YIGE1 is involved in sugar and auxin pathways to regulate ear inflorescence meristem (IM) development and thus affects EL in maize. Here, we reveal that YIGE2, the paralog of YIGE1, regulates maize ear development and EL through auxin pathway. Knockout of YIGE2 causes a significant decrease of auxin level, IM length, floret number, EL, and grain yield. yige1 yige2 double mutants had even shorter IM and ears implying that these two genes redundantly regulate IM development and EL. The genes controlling auxin levels are differential expressed in yige1 yige2 double mutants, leading to lower auxin level. These results elucidated the critical role of YIGE2 and the redundancy between YIGE2 and YIGE1 in maize ear development, providing a new genetic resource for maize yield improvement."
38804844,drought response,Phosphorylation of ZmAL14 by ZmSnRK2.2 regulates drought resistance through derepressing ZmROP8 expression.,"Drought stress has negative effects on crop growth and production. Characterization of transcription factors that regulate the expression of drought-responsive genes is critical for understanding the transcriptional regulatory networks in response to drought, which facilitates the improvement of crop drought tolerance. Here, we identified an Alfin-like (AL) family gene ZmAL14 that negatively regulates drought resistance. Overexpression of ZmAL14 exhibits susceptibility to drought while mutation of ZmAL14 enhances drought resistance. An abscisic acid (ABA)-activated protein kinase ZmSnRK2.2 interacts and phosphorylates ZmAL14 at T38 residue. Knockout of ZmSnRK2.2 gene decreases drought resistance of maize. A dehydration-induced Rho-like small guanosine triphosphatase gene ZmROP8 is directly targeted and repressed by ZmAL14. Phosphorylation of ZmAL14 by ZmSnRK2.2 prevents its binding to the ZmROP8 promoter, thereby releasing the repression of ZmROP8 transcription. Overexpression of ZmROP8 stimulates peroxidase activity and reduces hydrogen peroxide accumulation after drought treatment. Collectively, our study indicates that ZmAL14 is a negative regulator of drought resistance, which can be phosphorylated by ZmSnRK2.2 through the ABA signaling pathway, thus preventing its suppression on ZmROP8 transcription during drought stress response."
38812347,days to flowering,Population-level gene expression can repeatedly link genes to functions in maize.,"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can provide single gene resolution for candidate genes in plants, complementing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) but efforts in plants have been met with, at best, mixed success. We generated expression data from 693 maize genotypes, measured in a common field experiment, sampled over a 2-h period to minimize diurnal and environmental effects, using full-length RNA-seq to maximize the accurate estimation of transcript abundance. TWAS could identify roughly 10 times as many genes likely to play a role in flowering time regulation as GWAS conducted data from the same experiment. TWAS using mature leaf tissue identified known true-positive flowering time genes known to act in the shoot apical meristem, and trait data from a new environment enabled the identification of additional flowering time genes without the need for new expression data. eQTL analysis of TWAS-tagged genes identified at least one additional known maize flowering time gene through trans-eQTL interactions. Collectively these results suggest the gene expression resource described here can link genes to functions across different plant phenotypes expressed in a range of tissues and scored in different experiments."
38812677,response to Rhizoctonia solani,Molecular characterization revealed the role of thaumatin-like proteins of Rhizoctonia solani AG4-JY in inducing maize disease resistance.,"The gene family of thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) plays a crucial role in the adaptation of organisms to environmental stresses. In recent years, fungal secreted proteins (SP) with inducing disease resistance activity in plants have emerged as important elicitors in the control of fungal diseases. Identifying SPs with inducing disease resistance activity and studying their mechanisms are crucial for controlling sheath blight. In the present study, 10 proteins containing the thaumatin-like domain were identified in strain AG4-JY of Rhizoctonia solani and eight of the 10 proteins had signal peptides. Analysis of the TLP genes of the 10 different anastomosis groups (AGs) showed that the evolutionary relationship of the TLP gene was consistent with that between different AGs of R. solani. Furthermore, it was found that RsTLP3, RsTLP9 and RsTLP10 were regarded as secreted proteins for their signaling peptides exhibited secretory activity. Prokaryotic expression and enzyme activity analysis revealed that the three secreted proteins possess glycoside hydrolase activity, suggesting they belong to the TLP family. Additionally, spraying the crude enzyme solution of the three TLP proteins could enhance maize resistance to sheath blight. Further analysis showed that genes associated with the salicylic acid and ethylene pathways were up-regulated following RsTLP3 application. The results indicated that RsTLP3 had a good application prospect in biological control."
38816789,Biotic stress response; Abiotic stress response,Functional annotation and meta-analysis of maize transcriptomes reveal genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress,"Background: Environmental stress factors, such as biotic and abiotic stress, are becoming more common due to climate variability, significantly affecting global maize yield. Transcriptome profiling studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying stress response in maize, though the functions of many genes are still unknown. To enhance the functional annotation of maize-specific genes, MaizeGDB has outlined a data-driven approach with an emphasis on identifying genes and traits related to biotic and abiotic stress. 
Results: We mapped high-quality RNA-Seq expression reads from 24 different publicly available datasets (17 abiotic and seven biotic studies) generated from the B73 cultivar to the recent version of the reference genome B73 (B73v5) and deduced stress-related functional annotation of maize gene models. We conducted a robust meta-analysis of the transcriptome profiles from the datasets to identify maize loci responsive to stress, identifying 3,230 differentially expressed genes (DEGs): 2,555 DEGs regulated in response to abiotic stress, 408 DEGs regulated during biotic stress, and 267 common DEGs (co-DEGs) that overlap between abiotic and biotic stress. We discovered hub genes from network analyses, and among the hub genes of the co-DEGs we identified a putative NAC domain transcription factor superfamily protein (Zm00001eb369060) IDP275, which previously responded to herbivory and drought stress. IDP275 was up-regulated in our analysis in response to eight different abiotic and four different biotic stresses. A gene set enrichment and pathway analysis of hub genes of the co-DEGs revealed hormone-mediated signaling processes and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Using phylostratigraphic analysis, we also demonstrated how abiotic and biotic stress genes differentially evolve to adapt to changing environments. 
Conclusions: These results will help facilitate the functional annotation of multiple stress response gene models and annotation in maize. Data can be accessed and downloaded at the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB)."
38816933,leaf angle,Coordinated control for the auricle asymmetric development by ZmIDD14 and ZmIDD15 fine-tune the high-density planting adaption in maize.,"Multiple distinct specialized regions shape the architecture of maize leaves. Among them, the fringe-like and wedge-shaped auricles alter the angle between the leaf and stalk, which is a key trait in crop plant architecture. As planting density increased, a small leaf angle (LA) was typically selected to promote crop light capture efficiency and yield. In the present study, we characterized two paralogous INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) genes, ZmIDD14 and ZmIDD15, which contain the Cys2-His2 zinc finger domain and function redundantly to regulate auricle development and LA in maize. Loss-of-function mutants showed decreased LA by reducing adaxial sclerenchyma thickness and increasing the colourless cell layers. In addition, the idd14;idd15 double mutant exhibited asymmetrically smaller auricles, which might cause by a failed maintenance of symmetric expression of the key auricle size controlling gene, LIGULELESS(LG1). The transcripts of ZmIDD14 and ZmIDD15 enriched in the ligular region, where LG1 was highly expressed, and both proteins physically interacted with ZmILI1 to promote LG1 transcription. Notably, the idd14;idd15 enhanced the grain yield of hybrids under high planting densities by shaping the plant architecture with a smaller LA. These findings demonstrate the functions of ZmIDD14 and ZmIDD15 in controlling the abaxial/adaxial development of sclerenchyma in the midrib and polar development along the medial-lateral axes of auricles and provide an available tool for high-density and high-yield breeding in maize."
38831278,hormone response; Abiotic stress response,Genome-wide identification and investigation of monosaccharide transporter gene family based on their evolution and expression analysis under abiotic stress and hormone treatments in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Background: Monosaccharide transporter (MST) family, as a carrier for monosaccharide transport, plays an important role in carbon partitioning and widely involves in plant growth and development, stress response, and signaling transduction. However, little information on the MST family genes is reported in maize (Zea mays), especially in response to abiotic stresses. In this study, the genome-wide identification of MST family genes was performed in maize. 

Result: A total of sixty-six putative members of MST gene family were identified and divided into seven subfamilies (including SPT, PMT, VGT, INT, pGlcT, TMT, and ERD) using bioinformatics approaches, and gene information, phylogenetic tree, chromosomal location, gene structure, motif composition, and cis-acting elements were investigated. Eight tandem and twelve segmental duplication events were identified, which played an important role in the expansion of the ZmMST family. Synteny analysis revealed the evolutionary features of MST genes in three gramineous crop species. The expression analysis indicated that most of the PMT, VGT, and ERD subfamilies members responded to osmotic and cadmium stresses, and some of them were regulated by ABA signaling, while only a few members of other subfamilies responded to stresses. In addition, only five genes were induced by NaCl stress in MST family. 

Conclusion: These results serve to understand the evolutionary relationships of the ZmMST family genes and supply some insight into the processes of monosaccharide transport and carbon partitioning on the balance between plant growth and development and stress response in maize."
38833865,seed viability; germination index,Green analytical assay for the viability assessment of single maize seeds using double-threshold strategy for catalase activity and malondialdehyde content.,"The development of nondestructive technology for the detection of seed viability is challenging. In this study, to establish a green and effective method for the viability assessment of single maize seeds, a two-stage seed viability detection method was proposed. The catalase (CAT) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were selected as the most key biochemical components affecting maize seed viability, and regression prediction models were developed based on their hyperspectral information and a data fusion strategy. Qualitative discrimination models for seed viability evaluation were constructed based on the predicted response values of the selected key biochemical components. The results showed that the double components thresholds strategy achieved the highest discrimination accuracy (92.9%), providing a crucial approach for the rapid and environmentally friendly detection of seed viability. 
Highlights:
    •    The viability and components information of the same seed were obtained simultaneously. 
    •    The CAT activity and MDA content were accurately predicted. 
    •    The seed viability was accurately evaluated using double thresholds strategy."
38836794,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,Reconsidering the Lessons Learned from the 1970 Southern Corn Leaf Blight Epidemic.,"The southern corn leaf blight epidemic of 1970 caused estimated losses of ~16% for the US corn crop, equivalent to ~$8 billion in current terms. The epidemic was caused by the prevalence of Texas male sterile cytoplasm (cms-T), used to produce most of the hybrid corn seed planted that year, combined with the emergence of a novel race of the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus that was exquisitely virulent on cms-T corn. Remarkably, the epidemic lasted just a single year. This episode has often been portrayed in the literature and textbooks over the last 50 years as a catastrophic mistake perpetrated by corn breeders and seed companies of the time who did not understand or account for the dangers of crop genetic uniformity. In this perspective article, we aim to present an alternative interpretation of these events. First, we contend that, rather than being caused by a grievous error on the part of the corn breeding and seed industry, this epidemic was a particularly unfortunate, unusual and unlucky consequence of a technological advancement intended to improve the efficiency of corn seed production for America's farmers. Second, we tell the story of the resolution of the epidemic as an example of timely, meticulous applied research in the public sector for the public good."
38839061,Physiologic; Stress response,Genetic variability of aquaporin expression in maize: from eQTLs to a MITE insertion regulating PIP2; 5 expression.,"Plant aquaporins are involved in numerous physiological processes, such as cellular homeostasis, tissue hydraulics, transpiration, and nutrient supply, and are key players of the response to environmental cues. While varying expression patterns of aquaporin genes have been described across organs, developmental stages and stress conditions, the underlying regulation mechanisms remain elusive. Hence, this work aimed to shed light on the expression variability of four plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) genes in maize (Zea mays) leaves, and its genetic causes, through eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) mapping across a 252-hybrid diversity panel. Significant genetic variability in PIP transcript abundance was observed to different extents depending on the isoforms. The genome-wide association study mapped numerous eQTLs, both local and distant, thus emphasizing the existing natural diversity of PIP gene expression across the studied panel and the potential to reveal regulatory actors and mechanisms. One eQTL associated with PIP2; 5 expression variation was characterized. Genomic sequence comparison and in vivo reporter assay attributed, at least partly, the local eQTL to a transposon-containing polymorphism in the PIP2; 5 promoter. This work paves the way to the molecular understanding of PIP gene regulation and its possible integration into larger networks regulating physiological and stress-adaptation processes."
38843468,insect response; disease response; response to weed stress,"Maize yields have stagnated in sub-Sahara Africa: a possible transgenic solution to weed, pathogen and insect constraints.","Despite major breeding efforts by various national and international agencies, yields for the ~40 million hectares of maize, the major food crop in sub-Saharan Africa, have stagnated at <2 tons/ha/year for the past decade, one-third the global average. Breeders have succeeded in breeding increased yield with a modicum of tolerance to some single-weed or pathogen stresses. There has been minimal adoption of these varieties because introgressing polygenic yield and tolerance traits into locally adapted material is very challenging. Multiple traits to deal with pests (weeds, pathogens, and insects) are needed for farmer acceptance, because African fields typically encounter multiple pest constraints. Also, maize has no inherent resistance to some of these pest constraints, rendering them intractable to traditional breeding. The proposed solution is to simultaneously engineer multiple traits into one genetic locus. The dominantly inherited multi-pest resistance trait single locus can be bred simply into locally adapted, elite high-yielding material, and would be valuable for farmers, vastly increasing maize yields, and allowing for more than regional maize sufficiency."
38864891,"starch content, kernel; phosphorus content",Exploring the phosphorus-starch content balance mechanisms in maize grains using GWAS population and transcriptome data.,"Examining the connection between P and starch-related signals can help elucidate the balance between nutrients and yield. This study utilized 307 diverse maize inbred lines to conduct multi-year and multi-plot trials, aiming to explore the relationship among P content, starch content, and 100-kernel weight (HKW) of mature grains. A significant negative correlation was found between P content and both starch content and HKW, while starch content showed a positive correlation with HKW. The starch granules in grains with high-P and low-starch content (HPLS) were significantly smaller compared to grains with low-P high-starch content (LPHS). Additionally, mian04185-4 (HPLS) exhibited irregular and loosely packed starch granules. A significant decrease in ZmPHOs genes expression was detected in the HPLS line ZNC442 as compared to the LPHS line SCML0849, while no expression difference was observed in AGPase encoding genes between these two lines. The down-regulated genes in ZNC442 grains were enriched in nucleotide sugar and fatty acid anabolic pathways, while up-regulated genes were enriched in the ABC transporters pathway. An accelerated breakdown of fat as the P content increased was also observed. This implied that HPLS was resulted from elevated lipid decomposition and inadequate carbon sources. The GWAS analysis identified 514 significantly associated genes, out of which 248 were differentially expressed. Zm00001d052392 was found to be significantly associated with P content/HKW, exhibiting high expression in SCML0849 but almost no expression in ZNC442. Overall, these findings suggested new approaches for achieving a P-yield balance through the manipulation of lipid metabolic pathways in grains."
38865493,response to salt,"Evaluation of maize varieties via multivariate analysis: Roles of ionome, antioxidants, and autophagy in salt tolerance","Salt stress presents a major obstacle to maize (Zea mays L.) production globally, impeding its growth and development. In this study, we aimed to identify salt-tolerant maize varieties through evaluation using multivariate analysis and shed light on the role of ionome, antioxidant capacity, and autophagy in salt tolerance. We investigated multiple growth indices, including shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, plant height, chlorophyll content, electrolyte leakage, potassium and sodium contents, and potassium-to-sodium ratio in 20 maize varieties at the V3 stage under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). The results showed significant differences in the growth indices, accompanied by a wide range in their coefficient of variation, suggesting their suitability for screening salt tolerance. Based on D values, clustering analysis categorized the 20 varieties into four distinct groups. TG88, KN20, and LR888 (group I) emerged as the most salt-tolerant varieties, while YD9, XD903, and LH151 (group IV) were identified as the most sensitive. TG88 showcased nutrient preservation and redistribution under salt stress, surpassing YD9. It maintained nitrogen and iron levels in roots while YD9 experienced decreases. TG88 redistributed more nitrogen, zinc, and potassium to its leaves, outperforming YD9. TG88 preserved sulfur levels in both roots and leaves, unlike YD9. Additionally, TG88 demonstrated higher enzymatic antioxidant capacity (SOD, POD, APX, and GR) both at the enzyme and gene expression levels, upregulation of autophagy-related (ATG) genes (ZmATG6, ZmATG8a, and ZmATG10), and increased autophagic activity. Overall, this study offers insights into accurate maize varieties evaluation methods and the physiological mechanisms underlying salt tolerance and identifies promising materials for further research."
38866052,response to plant population; leaf canopy architecture,Maize smart-canopy architecture enhances yield at high densities.,"Increasing planting density is a key strategy to enhance maize yields1-3. An ideotype for dense planting requires a 'smart canopy' with leaf angles at different canopy layers differentially optimized to maximize light interception and photosynthesis4-6, amongst other features. Here, we identified leaf angle architecture of smart canopy 1 (lac1), a natural mutant possessing upright upper leaves, less erect middle leaves and relatively flat lower leaves. lac1 has improved photosynthetic capacity and weakened shade-avoidance responses under dense planting. lac1 encodes a brassinosteroid C-22 hydroxylase that predominantly regulates upper leaf angle. Phytochrome A photoreceptors accumulate in shade and interact with the transcription factor RAVL1 to promote its degradation via the 26S proteasome, thereby attenuating RAVL1 activation of lac1 and reducing brassinosteroid levels. This ultimately decreases upper leaf angle in dense fields. Large-scale field trials demonstrate lac1 boosts maize yields under high densities. To quickly introduce lac1 into breeding germplasm, we transformed a haploid inducer and recovered homozygous lac1 edits from 20 diverse inbred lines. The tested doubled haploids uniformly acquired smart-canopy-like plant architecture. We provide an important target and an accelerated strategy for developing high-density-tolerant cultivars, with lac1 serving as a genetic chassis for further engineering of a smart canopy in maize."
38870017,water use efficiency,Protocol to study the photosynthetic response of maize to the CO2-temperature coupling effect at ear stage using a specialized designed gradient.,"Global warming will change the photosynthesis and transpiration of plants greatly and ultimately affect water use efficiency (WUE). Here, we present a protocol to investigate the response of maize WUE to the coupling effect of CO2 and temperature at ear stage using a specialized designed gradient. We describe steps for plant culture, parameter measurements, model fitting, and statistical analysis. This protocol holds potential for studying the response of WUE and CO2 adaptation across various plant species.

38871096,response to heavy metals,Molecular evolution and functional diversification of metal tolerance protein families in cereals plants and function of maize MTP protein,"Plants employ metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) to confer tolerance by sequestering excess ions into vacuoles. MTPs belong to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family, which facilitates the transport of divalent transition metal cations. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the MTP gene families across 21 plant species, including maize (Zea mays). A total of 247 MTP genes were identified within these plant genomes and categorized into distinct subgroups, namely Zn-CDF, Mn-CDF, and Fe/Zn-CDF, based on phylogenetic analyses. This investigation encompassed the characterization of genomic distribution, gene structures, cis-regulatory elements, collinearity relationships, and gene ontology functions associated with MTPs. Transcriptomic analyses unveiled stress-specific expression patterns of MTP genes under various abiotic stresses. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR assays were employed to assess maize MTP gene responses to diverse heavy metal stress conditions. Functional validation of metal tolerance roles was achieved through heterologous expression in yeast. This integrated evolutionary scrutiny of MTP families in cereals furnishes a valuable framework for the elucidation of MTP functions in subsequent studies. Notably, the prioritized MTP gene ZmMTP6 emerged as a positive regulator of plant Cd tolerance, thereby offering a pivotal genetic asset for the development of Cd-tolerant crops, particularly maize cultivars. 
Highlights: 
    •    The study identified 247 MTP genes across 21 plant species. 
    •    Research showed differential expression of MTPs under metal stresses. 
    •    The prioritized MTP gene ZmMTP6 can regulate Cd tolerance in maize and Arabidopsis."
38872054,amylose level,Combining genome-wide association study and linkage mapping in the genetic dissection of amylose content in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Integrated linkage and association analysis revealed genetic basis across multiple environments. The genes Zm00001d003102 and Zm00001d015905 were further verified to influence amylose content using gene-based association study. Maize kernel amylose is an important source of human food and industrial raw material. However, the genetic basis underlying maize amylose content is still obscure. Herein, we used an intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 doubled haploid population composed of 222 lines and a germplasm set including 305 inbred lines to uncover the genetic control for amylose content under four environments. Linkage mapping detected 16 unique QTL, among which four were individually repeatedly identified across multiple environments. Genome-wide association study revealed 17 significant (P = 2.24E-06) single-nucleotide polymorphisms, of which two (SYN19568 and PZE-105090500) were located in the intervals of the mapped QTL (qAC2 and qAC5-3), respectively. According to the two population co-localized loci, 20 genes were confirmed as the candidate genes for amylose content. Gene-based association analysis indicated that the variants in Zm00001d003102 (Beta-16-galactosyltransferase GALT29A) and Zm00001d015905 (Sugar transporter 4a) affected amylose content across multi-environment. Tissue expression analysis showed that the two genes were specifically highly expressed in the ear and stem, respectively, suggesting that they might participate in sugar transport from source to sink organs. Our study provides valuable genetic information for breeding maize varieties with high amylose."
38874204,response to deep sowing,Maize ZmSRO1e promotes mesocotyl elongation and deep sowing tolerance by inhibiting the activity of ZmbZIP61.,"Deep sowing is a traditional method for drought resistance in maize production, and mesocotyl elongation is strongly associated with the ability of maize to germinate from deep soil. However, little is known about the functional genes and mechanisms regulating maize mesocotyl elongation. In the present study, we identified a plant-specific SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE (SRO) protein family member, ZmSRO1e, involved in maize mesocotyl elongation. The expression of ZmSRO1e is strongly inhibited upon transfer from dark to white light. The loss-of-function zmsro1e mutant exhibited a dramatically shorter mesocotyl than the wild-type in both constant light and darkness, while overexpression of ZmSRO1e significantly promoted mesocotyl elongation, indicating that ZmSRO1e positively regulates mesocotyl elongation. We showed that ZmSRO1e physically interacted with ZmbZIP61, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and showed a function similar to that of HY5 in regulating photomorphogenesis. We found that ZmSRO1e repressed the transcriptional activity of ZmbZIP61 toward target genes involved in the regulation of cell expansion, such as ZmEXPB4 and ZmEXPB6, by interfering with the binding of ZmbZIP61 to the promoters of target genes. Our results provide a new understanding of the mechanism by which SRO regulates photomorphogenesis and highlight its potential application in deep sowing-resistant breeding."
38878261,response to salt; drought response,Maize auxin response factor ZmARF1 confers multiple abiotic stresses resistances in transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Prolonged exposure to abiotic stresses causes oxidative stress, which affects plant development and survival. In this research, the overexpression of ZmARF1 improved tolerance to low Pi, drought and salinity stresses. The transgenic plants manifested tolerance to low Pi by their superior root phenotypic traits: root length, root tips, root surface area, and root volume, compared to wide-type (WT) plants. Moreover, the transgenic plants exhibited higher root and leaf Pi content and upregulated the high affinity Pi transporters PHT1;2 and phosphorus starvation inducing (PSI) genes PHO2 and PHR1 under low Pi conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis displayed tolerance to drought and salt stress by maintaining higher chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence, lower water loss rates, and ion leakage, which contributed to the survival of overexpression lines compared to the WT. Transcriptome profiling identified a peroxidase gene, POX, whose transcript was upregulated by these abiotic stresses. Furthermore, we confirmed that ZmARF1 bound to the auxin response element (AuxRE) in the promoter of POX and enhanced its transcription to mediate tolerance to oxidative stress imposed by low Pi, drought and salt stress in the transgenic seedlings. These results demonstrate that ZmARF1 has significant potential for improving the tolerance of crops to multiple abiotic stresses."
38880448,drought response,Heterologous synthesis of poly-γ-glutamic acid enhanced drought resistance in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Drought stress is the main factor restricting maize yield. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), as a water-retaining agent and fertilizer synergist, could significantly improve the drought resistance and yield of many crops. However, its high production costs and unclear long-term impact on soil ecology limit its large-scale application. In this study, an environmentally friendly green material γ-PGA was heterologous synthesized in maize for the first time using the synthetic biology method. The genes (PgsA, PgsB, PgsC) participated in γ-PGA synthesis were cloned from Bacillus licheniformis and transformed into maize to produce γ-PGA for the first time. Under drought stress, transgenic maize significantly increased the ear length, ear weight and grain weight by 50 % compared to the control, whereas the yield characteristic of ear weight, grain number per ear, grain weight per ear and 100-grain weight increased by 1.67 %-2.33 %, 3.78 %-13.06 %, 8.41 %-22.06 %, 6.03 %-19.28 %, and 11.85 %-18.36 %, respectively under normal growth conditions. γ-PGA was mainly expressed in the mesophyll cells of maize leaf rosette structure and improved drought resistance and yield by protecting and increasing the expression of genes for the photosynthetic and carbon fixation. This study is an important exploration for maize drought stress molecular breeding and building resource-saving agriculture."
38885565,response to salt,The maize sugar transporters ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b positively regulate salt tolerance in plants.,"The SWEETs (sugars will eventually be exported transporter) family comprises a class of recently identified sugar transporters that play diverse roles in regulating plant development. Beyond those fundamental functions, emerging evidence suggests that SWEETs may also be involved in plant stress responses, such as salt tolerance. However, the specific role of maize SWEETs in regulating salt tolerance remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that two maize SWEET family members, ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b, are typical sugar transporters with seven transmembrane helices localized in the cell membrane. The heterologous expression of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b in the yeast mutant strain confirms their role as sucrose transporters. Overexpression of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b in Arabidopsis resulted in improved NaCl resistance and significant increase in seed germination rate compared to the wild type. Furthermore, by generating maize knockout mutants, we observe that the absence of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b affects both plant growth and grain development. The salt treatment results indicate that the knockout mutants of these two genes are more sensitive to salt stress. Comparative analyses revealed that wild-type maize plants outperformed the knockout mutants in terms of growth parameters and physiological indices. Our findings unravel a novel function of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b in the salt stress response, offering a theoretical foundation for enhancing maize salt resistance. 
Highlights: 
    •    ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b are sugar transporter proteins containing 7 transmembrane helices and are evolutionary conserved. 
    •    ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b are localized in the cell membrane and function as sucrose transporters. 
    •    Overexpression of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b improves salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
    •    Knockout of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b affects plant growth and seed development. 
    •    Knockout of ZmSWEET15a and ZmSWEET15b makes maize salt-sensitive."
38887929,response to low phosphorus,Natural variation in root traits identifies significant SNPs and candidate genes for phosphate deficiency tolerance in Zea mays L.,"Phosphorus (P) is a crucial macronutrient required for normal plant growth. Its effective uptake from the soil is a trait of agronomic importance. Natural variation in maize (339 accessions) root traits, namely root length and number of primary, seminal, and crown roots, root and shoot phosphate (Pi) contents, and root-to-shoot Pi translocation (root: shoot Pi) under normal (control, 40 ppm) and low phosphate (LP, 1 ppm) conditions, were used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK) model of GWAS provided 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 12 relevant candidate genes putatively linked with root Pi, root: shoot Pi, and crown root number (CRN) under LP. The DNA-protein interaction analysis of Zm00001d002842, Zm00001d002837, Zm00001d002843 for root Pi, and Zm00001d044312, Zm00001d045550, Zm00001d025915, Zm00001d044313, Zm00001d051842 for root: shoot Pi, and Zm00001d031561, Zm00001d001803, and Zm00001d001804 for CRN showed the presence of potential binding sites of key transcription factors like MYB62, bZIP11, ARF4, ARF7, ARF10 and ARF16 known for induction/suppression of phosphate starvation response (PHR). The in-silico RNA-seq analysis revealed up or down-regulation of candidate genes along with key transcription factors of PHR, while Uniprot analysis provided genetic relatedness. Candidate genes that may play a role in P uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation under LP are proposed using common PHR signaling components like MYB62, ARF4, ARF7, ARF10, ARF16, and bZIP11 to induce changes in root growth in maize. Candidate genes may be used to improve low P tolerance in maize using the CRISPR strategy."
38890571,calcium content,The contribution of Ca and Mg to the accumulation of amino acids in maize: from the response of physiological and biochemical processes,"Background: The quality of maize kernels is significantly enhanced by amino acids, which are the fundamental building blocks of proteins. Meanwhile, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), as important nutrients for maize growth, are vital in regulating the metabolic pathways and enzyme activities of amino acid synthesis. Therefore, our study analyzed the response process and changes of amino acid content, endogenous hormone content, and antioxidant enzyme activity in kernels to the coupling addition of sugar alcohol-chelated Ca and Mg fertilizers with spraying on maize. 

Result: (1) The coupled addition of Ca and Mg fertilizers increased the Ca and Mg content, endogenous hormone components (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA; gibberellin, GA; zeatin riboside, ZR) content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and amino acid content of maize kernels. The content of Ca and Mg in kernels increased with the increasing levels of Ca and Mg fertilizers within a certain range from the filling to the wax ripening stage, and significantly positively correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities. (2) The contents of IAA, GA, and ZR continued to rise, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were elevated, which effectively enhanced the ability of cells to resist oxidative damage, promoted cell elongation and division, and facilitated the growth and development of maize. However, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased consistently, which would attack the defense system of the cell membrane plasma to some extent. (3) Leucine (LEU) exhibited the highest percentage of essential amino acid components and a gradual decline from the filling to the wax ripening stage, with the most substantial beneficial effect on essential amino acids. (4) CAT and SOD favorably governed essential amino acids, while IAA and MDA negatively regulated them. The dominant physiological driving pathway for the synthesis of essential amino acids was ""IAA-CAT-LEU"", in which IAA first negatively drove CAT activity, and CAT then advantageously controlled LEU synthesis. 

Conclusion: These findings provide a potential approach to the physiological and biochemical metabolism of amino acid synthesis, and the nutritional quality enhancement of maize kernel."
38892463,response to heat stress,ZmNF-YA1 Contributes to Maize Thermotolerance by Regulating Heat Shock Response,"Zea mays (maize) is a staple food, feed, and industrial crop. Heat stress is one of the major stresses affecting maize production and is usually accompanied by other stresses, such as drought. Our previous study identified a heterotrimer complex, ZmNF-YA1-YB16-YC17, in maize. ZmNF-YA1 and ZmNF-YB16 were positive regulators of the drought stress response and were involved in maize root development. In this study, we investigated whether ZmNF-YA1 confers heat stress tolerance in maize. The nf-ya1 mutant and overexpression lines were used to test the role of ZmNF-YA1 in maize thermotolerance. The nf-ya1 mutant was more temperature-sensitive than the wild-type (WT), while the ZmNF-YA1 overexpression lines showed a thermotolerant phenotype. Higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were observed in the mutant, followed by WT and overexpression lines after heat stress treatment, while an opposite trend was observed for chlorophyll content. RNA-seq was used to analyze transcriptome changes in nf-ya1 and its wild-type control W22 in response to heat stress. Based on their expression profiles, the heat stress response-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nf-ya1 compared to WT were grouped into seven clusters via k-means clustering. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs in different clades was performed to elucidate the roles of ZmNF-YA1-mediated transcriptional regulation and their contribution to maize thermotolerance. The loss function of ZmNF-YA1 led to the failure induction of DEGs in GO terms of protein refolding, protein stabilization, and GO terms for various stress responses. Thus, the contribution of ZmNF-YA1 to protein stabilization, refolding, and regulation of abscisic acid (ABA), ROS, and heat/temperature signaling may be the major reason why ZmNF-YA1 overexpression enhanced heat tolerance, and the mutant showed a heat-sensitive phenotype."
38896149,response to barley yellow dwarf virus,Fine mapping a QTL for BYDV-PAV resistance in maize.,"Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) is one of the economically most important virus diseases of cereals worldwide, causing yield losses up to 80%. The means to control BYD are limited, and the use of genetically resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally friendly approach. The objectives of this study were i) to identify the causative gene for BYD virus (BYDV)-PAV resistance in maize, ii) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or structural variations in the gene sequences, which may cause differing susceptibilities to BYDV-PAV of maize inbreds, and iii) to characterize the effect of BYDV-PAV infection on gene expression of susceptible, tolerant, and resistant maize inbreds. Using two biparental mapping populations, we could reduce a previously published quantitative trait locus for BYDV-PAV resistance in maize to ~ 0.3 Mbp, comprising nine genes. Association mapping and gene expression analysis further reduced the number of candidate genes for BYDV-PAV resistance in maize to two: Zm00001eb428010 and Zm00001eb428020. The predicted functions of these genes suggest that they confer BYDV-PAV resistance either via interfering with virus replication or by inducing reactive oxygen species signaling. The gene sequence of Zm00001eb428010 is affected by a 54 bp deletion in the 5`-UTR and a protein altering variant in BYDV-PAV-resistant maize inbreds but not in BYDV-PAV-susceptible and -tolerant inbreds. This finding suggests that altered abundance and/or properties of the proteins encoded by Zm00001eb428010 may lead to BYDV-PAV resistance."
38897322,response to arsenic,"Untying arsenite tolerance mechanisms in contrasting maize genotypes attributed to NIPs-mediated controlled influx and root-to-shoot translocation, redox homeostasis and phytochelatin-mediated detoxification pathway.","Contamination of ground water and soil with toxic metalloids like arsenic (As) poses a serious hazard to the global agricultural food production. One of the best ways to restrict entry of As into the food chain is selection of germplasms which accrue extremely low level of As in grains. Here, we screened diverse maize genotypes under high arsenite (100 μM AsIII) stress and identified PMI-PV-9 and PMI-PV-3 as AsIII-tolerant and -sensitive maize genotype respectively. Expression of genes associated with As uptake, vacuolar sequestration, biosynthesis of phytochelatins, root-to-shoot translocation, in vivo ROS generation, fine tuning of antioxidant defense system, DNA and membrane damage, H2O2 and superoxide anion (O2•-) levels were compared among the selected genotypes. PMI-PV-9 plants performed much better than PMI-PV-3 in terms of plant growth with no visible symptom of As toxicity. Susceptibility of PMI-PV-3 to AsIII stress may be attributed to comparatively low expression of genes involved in phytochelatins (PCs) biosynthesis. Concomitant decrease in ABCC1 expression might be another key factor for futile sequestration of AsIII into root vacuoles. Moreover, up-regulation of ZmNIP3;1 might contribute in high root-to-leaf As translocation. Substantial spike in H2O2, O2•- and MDA levels indicates that PMI-PV-3 plants have experienced more oxidative stress than PMI-PV-9 plants. Appearance of prominent deep brown and dark blue spots/ stripes on leaves as revealed after DAB and NBT staining respectively suggest severe oxidative burst in PMI-PV-3 plants. Marked reduction in DHAR and MDAR activity rendered PMI-PV-3 cells to recycle ascorbate pool ineffectively, which might have exacerbated their susceptibility to AsIII stress. In a nutshell, incompetent PCs mediated detoxification system and disruption of cellular redox homeostasis owing to feeble antioxidant defence system resulting oxidative burst might be the prime reasons behind reduced performance of PMI-PV-3 plants under AsIII stress. 
Highlights:
    •    Present study demonstrates arsenite (AsIII) stress tolerance mechanism in maize 
    •    Up-regulation of NIPs resulting high AsIII uptake by root leads to sensitivity 
    •    Inefficient PC mediated detoxification system contributes to AsIII susceptibility 
    •    High AsIII sequestration in root vacuole leads to low root-to-shoot As translocation 
    •    AsIII induced deregulation of cellular redox homeostasis results in oxidative burst"
38901230,response to common cutworm,Comparative proteome analysis of Spodoptera litura-infested Zea mays reveals a robust defense strategy targeting insect peritrophic membrane.,"Herbivorous insects such as Spodoptera litura, pose a constant threat to agricultural crops. The incompetence of contemporary pest management tools and techniques stipulates unravelling of molecular dogma, that drives pest-plant interaction. From our previous observations, we inferred that despite being a voracious polyphagous herbivore, S. litura growth and adaptability is severely hampered on maize foliage diet. In this investigation we explored further and demonstrated the impact of maize diet on the insect gut peritrophic membrane (PM, a crucial membrane involved in compartmentalizing digestive events and absorption of nutrients), its structural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed damaged and perforated PM. Further, this study delves into the intricate resistance mechanism adapted by Z. mays against S. litura by conducting a comparative proteome analysis. We have detected 345 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) at p < 0.05 and fold change ≥1. The DAPs were categorized as plant defense, secondary metabolite synthesis, redox homeostasis, cytoskeleton/cell wall biosynthesis, primary metabolism, transport and molecular processes. We remarkably report differential expression of proteolysis- and defense-related proteins that have potential to target insect gut, digestion and absorption of nutrients. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular dynamics governing maize resistance against S. litura. Understanding of such intricate molecular dialogues at these interfaces could provide valuable information on the arms race between plants and herbivores, it may pave the way for innovative pest management strategies. 
Highlights: 
    •    The growth and development of S. litura is hampered on maize foliage diet. 
    •    The maize foliage diet damages insect gut peritrophic membrane (PM) and microvilli. 
    •    A comparative proteome analysis detected 168 upregulated and 177 downregulated DAPs. 
    •    Upregulation of enzymes targeting insect gut (Cys protease, chitinase) was noted. 
    •    These findings enhance understanding of maize resistance, potentially leading to novel IPM strategies."
38903418,Stress response; Growth and Development,Enigmatic role of auxin response factors in plant growth and stress tolerance.,"Abiotic and biotic stresses globally constrain plant growth and impede the optimization of crop productivity. The phytohormone auxin is involved in nearly every aspect of plant development. Auxin acts as a chemical messenger that influences gene expression through a short nuclear pathway, mediated by a family of specific DNA-binding transcription factors known as Auxin Response Factors (ARFs). ARFs thus act as effectors of auxin response and translate chemical signals into the regulation of auxin responsive genes. Since the initial discovery of the first ARF in Arabidopsis, advancements in genetics, biochemistry, genomics, and structural biology have facilitated the development of models elucidating ARF action and their contributions to generating specific auxin responses. Yet, significant gaps persist in our understanding of ARF transcription factors despite these endeavors. Unraveling the functional roles of ARFs in regulating stress response, alongside elucidating their genetic and molecular mechanisms, is still in its nascent phase. Here, we review recent research outcomes on ARFs, detailing their involvement in regulating leaf, flower, and root organogenesis and development, as well as stress responses and their corresponding regulatory mechanisms: including gene expression patterns, functional characterization, transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post- translational regulation across diverse stress conditions. Furthermore, we delineate unresolved questions and forthcoming challenges in ARF research."
38903442,response to salt,A teosinte-derived allele of ZmSC improves salt tolerance in maize.,"Maize, a salt-sensitive crop, frequently suffers severe yield losses due to soil salinization. Enhancing salt tolerance in maize is crucial for maintaining yield stability. To address this, we developed an introgression line (IL76) through introgressive hybridization between maize wild relatives Zea perennis, Tripsacum dactyloides, and inbred Zheng58, utilizing the tri-species hybrid MTP as a genetic bridge. Previously, genetic variation analysis identified a polymorphic marker on Zm00001eb244520 (designated as ZmSC), which encodes a vesicle-sorting protein described as a salt-tolerant protein in the NCBI database. To characterize the identified polymorphic marker, we employed gene cloning and homologous cloning techniques. Gene cloning analysis revealed a non-synonymous mutation at the 1847th base of ZmSCIL76 , where a guanine-to-cytosine substitution resulted in the mutation of serine to threonine at the 119th amino acid sequence (using ZmSCZ58 as the reference sequence). Moreover, homologous cloning demonstrated that the variation site derived from Z. perennis. Functional analyses showed that transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmSCZ58 exhibited significant reductions in leaf number, root length, and pod number, alongside suppression of the expression of genes in the SOS and CDPK pathways associated with Ca2+ signaling. Similarly, fission yeast strains expressing ZmSCZ58 displayed inhibited growth. In contrast, the ZmSCIL76 allele from Z. perennis alleviated these negative effects in both Arabidopsis and yeast, with the lines overexpressing ZmSCIL76 exhibiting significantly higher abscisic acid (ABA) content compared to those overexpressing ZmSCZ58 . Our findings suggest that ZmSC negatively regulates salt tolerance in maize by suppressing downstream gene expression associated with Ca2+ signaling in the CDPK and SOS pathways. The ZmSCIL76 allele from Z. perennis, however, can mitigate this negative regulatory effect. These results provide valuable insights and genetic resources for future maize salt tolerance breeding programs."
38915200,response to heat stress,Molecular mechanisms underlying negative effects of transient heatwaves on crop fertility.,"Transient heatwaves occur more frequently with climate warming, yet their impacts on crop yield are severely underestimated and even overlooked. Heatwaves spanning mere days or even hours during sensitive stages (e.g., microgametogenesis and flowering) can significantly reduce crop yield by disrupting plant reproduction. Recently, advancements in multi-omics and GWAS analysis have shed light on specific organs (e.g., pollen, lodicule, and style), key metabolic pathways (sugar and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolisms, Ca2+ homeostasis), and essential genes for transient heatwaves responses during the most sensitive stages in many crops. Based on this, this review places particular emphasis on the crop's heat-sensitive stages, using pollen development, floret opening, pollination, and fertilization as the central narrative thread. Complementing by key parts such as lodicule and tapetum, the multifaceted effects of transient heatwaves and their molecular basis are systematically demonstrated. A number of heat-tolerant genes for these processes have been identified in major crops such as maize and rice. The mechanisms and key heat-tolerant genes shared over different stages potentially facilitate the improvement of heat-tolerant crops more precisely."
38917065,"kernel weight, 100 kernel; kernel row number; kernels per row",Genome-wide association analysis of four yield-related traits using a maize (Zea mays L.) F1 population,"Increasing the yield of maize F1 hybrid is one of the most important target for breeders. However, as a result of the genetic complexity and extremely low heritability, it is very difficult to directly dissect the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of yield, and reports on genetic analysis of F1 hybrid yield are rare. Taking F1 hybrid as the research object and dividing the yield into different affect factors, this approach may be the best strategy for clarifying the genetic mechanism of yield. Therefore, in this study, a maize F1 population consisting of 300 hybrids with 17,652 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers was used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) to filtrate candidate genes associated with the four yield-related traits, i.e., kernel row number (KRN), kernel number per row (KNPR), ear tip-barrenness (ETB), and hundred kernel weight (HKW). Combined with the results of previous studies and functional annotation information of candidate genes, a total of six candidate genes were identified as being associated with the four traits, which were involved in plant growth and development, protein synthesis response, phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction. Our results improve the understanding of the genetic basis of the four yield-related traits and may be provide a new strategy for the genetic basis of maize yield."
38917216,root mass; response to low nitrogen,NIN-LIKE PROTEIN3.2 inhibits repressor Aux/IAA14 expression and enhances root biomass in maize seedlings under low nitrogen.,"Plants generally enhance their root growth in the form of greater biomass and/or root length to boost nutrient uptake in response to short-term low nitrogen (LN). However, the underlying mechanisms of short-term LN-mediated root growth remain largely elusive. Our genome-wide association study, haplotype analysis, and phenotyping of transgenic plants showed that the crucial nitrate signaling component NIN-LIKE PROTEIN3.2 (ZmNLP3.2), a positive regulator of root biomass, is associated with natural variations in root biomass of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings under LN. The monocot-specific gene AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID14 (ZmAux/IAA14) exhibited opposite expression patterns to ZmNLP3.2 in ZmNLP3.2 knockout and overexpression lines, suggesting that ZmNLP3.2 hampers ZmAux/IAA14 transcription. Importantly, ZmAux/IAA14 knockout seedlings showed a greater root dry weight (RDW), whereas ZmAux/IAA14 overexpression reduced RDW under LN compared with wild-type plants, indicating that ZmAux/IAA14 negatively regulates the RDW of LN-grown seedlings. Moreover, in vitro and vivo assays indicated that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR19 (ZmARF19) binds to and transcriptionally activates ZmAux/IAA14, which was weakened by the ZmNLP3.2-ZmARF19 interaction. The zmnlp3.2 ZmAux/IAA14-OE seedlings exhibited further reduced RDW compared to ZmAux/IAA14 overexpression lines when subjected to LN treatment, corroborating the ZmNLP3.2-ZmAux/IAA14 interaction. Thus, our study reveals a ZmNLP3.2-ZmARF19-ZmAux/IAA14 module regulating root biomass in response to nitrogen limitation in maize."
38931053,disease response,Maize Leaf Disease Recognition Based on Improved Convolutional Neural Network ShuffleNetV2.,"The occurrence of maize diseases is frequent but challenging to manage. Traditional identification methods have low accuracy and complex model structures with numerous parameters, making them difficult to implement on mobile devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a corn leaf disease recognition model SNMPF based on convolutional neural network ShuffleNetV2. In the down-sampling module of the ShuffleNet model, the max pooling layer replaces the deep convolutional layer to perform down-sampling. This improvement helps to extract key features from images, reduce the overfitting of the model, and improve the model's generalization ability. In addition, to enhance the model's ability to express features in complex backgrounds, the Sim AM attention mechanism was introduced. This mechanism enables the model to adaptively adjust focus and pay more attention to local discriminative features. The results on a maize disease image dataset demonstrate that the SNMPF model achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.40%, representing a 4.1 percentage point improvement over the original model, while its size is only 1.56 MB. Compared with existing convolutional neural network models such as EfficientNet, MobileViT, EfficientNetV2, RegNet, and DenseNet, this model offers higher accuracy and a more compact size. As a result, it can automatically detect and classify maize leaf diseases under natural field conditions, boasting high-precision recognition capabilities. Its accurate identification results provide scientific guidance for preventing corn leaf disease and promote the development of precision agriculture."
38935162,response to low phosphorus,Genome-wide association studies dissect low-phosphorus stress response genes underling field and seedling traits in maize.,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant growth, and its deficiency can cause decreased crop yield. This study systematically evaluated the low-phosphate (Pi) response traits in a large population at maturity and seedling stages, and explored candidate genes and their interrelationships with specific traits. The results revealed a greater sensitivity of seedling maize to low-Pi stress compared to that at maturity stage. The phenotypic response patterns to low-Pi stress at different stages were independent. Chlorophyll content was found to be a potential indicator for screening low-Pi-tolerant materials in the field. A total of 2900 and 1446 significantly associated genes at the maturity and seedling stages were identified, respectively. Among these genes, 972 were uniquely associated with maturity traits, while 330 were specifically detected at the seedling stage under low-Pi stress. Moreover, 768 and 733 genes were specifically associated with index values (low-Pi trait/normal-Pi trait) at maturity and seedling stage, respectively. Genetic network diagrams showed that the low-Pi response gene Zm00001d022226 was specifically associated with multiple primary P-related traits under low-Pi conditions. A total of 963 out of 2966 genes specifically associated with traits under low-Pi conditions or index values were found to be induced by low-Pi stress. Notably, ZmSPX4.1 and ZmSPX2 were sharply up-regulated in response to low-Pi stress across different lines or tissues. These findings advance our understanding of maize's response to low-Pi stress at different developmental stages, shedding light on the genes and pathways implicated in this response."
38938017,response to flooding,Raffinose catabolism enhances maize waterlogging tolerance by stimulating adventitious root growth and development.,"Raffinose mitigates plant heat-, drought- and cold- stresses; however, whether raffinose contributes to plant waterlogging tolerance is unknown. The maize zmrafs-1 mutant seedlings lacking raffinose, generate fewer and shorter adventitious root (AR) and are more sensitive to waterlogging stress, while overexpression of ZmRAFS increases raffinose content, stimulates AR formation, and enhances the waterlogging tolerance of maize seedlings. Transcriptome analysis of NS (Null segregant) seedlings compared with that of zmrafs-1, particularly when waterlogged, revealed that the expression of genes related to galactose metabolism and the auxin biosynthetic pathway were upregulated by raffinose. Additionally, Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amounts significantly decreased or increased in zmrafs-1 or ZmRAFS-overexpressing seedlings, respectively. Inhibition of the hydrolysis of raffinose by DGJ (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) decreased the waterlogging tolerance of maize seedlings, decreased the expression of genes encoding proteins related to auxin transport-related genes as well as the IAA level in the seedlings, suggesting that the hydrolysis of raffinose is necessary for maize waterlogging tolerance. These data demonstrate that raffinose catabolism stimulates adventitious root formation via auxin signaling pathway to enhance maize waterlogging tolerance. 
Highlight: 
Raffinose promotes the growth of adventitious roots and enhances the maize waterlogging tolerance; The breakdown of raffinose contributes to maize waterlogging tolerance; Raffinose affects the accumulation of auxin in the basal node of maize seedlings."
38943629,response to heat stress,Identification of anther thermotolerance genes by the integration of linkage and association analysis in maize.,"Maize is one of the world's most important staple crops, yet its production is increasingly threatened by the rising frequency of high-temperature stress (HTS). To investigate the genetic basis of anther thermotolerance under field conditions, we performed linkage and association analysis to identify HTS response quantitative trait loci (QTL) using three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations and an association panel containing 375 diverse maize inbred lines. These analyses resulted in the identification of 16 co-located large QTL intervals. Among the 37 candidate genes identified in these QTL intervals, five have rice or Arabidopsis homologs known to influence pollen and filament development. Notably, one of the candidate genes, ZmDUP707, has been subject to selection pressure during breeding. Its expression is suppressed by HTS, leading to pollen abortion and barren seeds. We also identified several additional candidate genes potentially underly QTL previously reported by other researchers. Taken together, our results provide a pool of valuable candidate genes that could be employed by future breeding programs aiming at enhancing maize HTS tolerance."
38945803,drought response,ZmWRKY30 modulates drought tolerance in maize by influencing myo-inositol and reactive oxygen species homeostasis.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important food crop with a wide range of uses in both industry and agriculture. Drought stress during its growth cycle can greatly reduce maize crop yield and quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying maize responses to drought stress remain unclear. In this work, a WRKY transcription factor-encoding gene, ZmWRKY30, from drought-treated maize leaves was screened out and characterized. ZmWRKY30 gene expression was induced by dehydration treatments. The ZmWRKY30 protein localized to the nucleus and displayed transactivation activity in yeast. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmWRKY30 exhibited a significantly enhanced drought stress tolerance, as evidenced by the improved survival rate, increased antioxidant enzyme activity by superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), elevated proline content, and reduced lipid peroxidation recorded after drought stress treatment. In contrast, the mutator (Mu)-interrupted ZmWRKY30 homozygous mutant (zmwrky30) was more sensitive to drought stress than its null segregant (NS), characterized by the decreased survival rate, reduced antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, POD, and CAT) and proline content, as well as increased malondialdehyde accumulation. RNA-Seq analysis further revealed that, under drought conditions, the knockout of the ZmWRKY30 gene in maize affected the expression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS), proline, and myo-inositol metabolism. Meanwhile, the zmwrky30 mutant exhibited significant downregulation of myo-inositol content in leaves under drought stress. Combined, our results suggest that ZmWRKY30 positively regulates maize responses to water scarcity. This work provides potential target genes for the breeding of drought-tolerant maize."
38946140,response to plant population; leaf angle,Phytochrome B interacts with LIGULELESS1 to control plant architecture and density tolerance in maize.,"Over the past few decades, significant improvements in maize yield have been largely attributed to increased plant density of upright hybrid varieties rather than increased yield per plant. However, dense planting triggers shade avoidance responses (SAR) that optimize light absorption but impair plant vigor and performance, limiting yield improvement through increasing plant density. In this study, we demonstrated that high-density induced leaf angle narrowing and stem/stalk elongation are largely dependent on phytochrome B (phyB1/B2), the primary photoreceptor responsible for perceiving red (R) and far-red (FR) light in maize. Maize phyB physically interacts with the LIGULELESS1 (LG1), a classical key regulator of leaf angle, to coordinately regulate plant architecture and density tolerance. The abundance of LG1 is significantly increased by phyB under high R:FR light (low density) but rapidly decreases under low R:FR light (high density), correlating with variations in leaf angle and plant height under various densities. Additionally, we identified the homeobox transcription factor HB53 as a target co-repressed by both phyB and LG1 but rapidly induced by canopy shade, indicating its central role in response to varying densities. Notably, HB53 regulates plant architecture by controlling the elongation and division of ligular adaxial and abaxial cells. These findings uncover the phyB-LG1-HB53 regulatory module as a key molecular mechanism governing plant architecture and density tolerance, providing potential genetic targets for breeding maize hybrid varieties optimized for high-density planting."
38960996,response to Exserohilum turcicum,Identification of candidate gene associated with maize northern leaf blight resistance in a multi-parent population.,"QTL mapping combined with genome-wide association studies, revealed a potential candidate gene for  resistance to northern leaf blight in the tropical CATETO-related maize line YML226, providing a basis for marker-assisted selection of maize varieties.  Northern leaf blight (NLB) is a foliar disease that can cause severe yield losses in maize. Identifying and utilizing NLB-resistant genes is the most effective way to prevent and control this disease. In this study, five important inbred lines of maize were used as parental lines to construct a multi-parent population for the identification of NLB-resistant loci. QTL mapping and GWAS analysis revealed that QTL qtl_YML226_1, which had the largest phenotypic variance explanation (PVE) of 9.28%, and SNP 5-49,193,921 were co-located in the CATETO-related line YML226. This locus was associated with the candidate gene Zm00001d014471, which encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. In the coding region of Zm00001d014471, YML226 had more specific SNPs than the other parental lines. qRT-PCR showed that the relative expressions of Zm00001d014471 in inoculated and uninoculated leaves of YML226 were significantly higher, indicating that the expression of the candidate gene was correlated with NLB resistance. The analysis showed that the higher expression level in YML226 might be caused by SNP mutations. This study identified NLB resistance candidate loci and genes in the tropical maize inbred line YML226 derived from the CATETO germplasm, thereby providing a theoretical basis for using modern marker-assisted breeding techniques to select genetic resources resistant to NLB."
38962989,lipid content,The biosynthesis of storage reserves and auxin is coordinated by a hierarchical regulatory network in maize endosperm.,"Grain filling in maize (Zea mays) is intricately linked to cell development, involving the regulation of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of storage reserves (starch, proteins, and lipids) and phytohormones. However, the regulatory network coordinating these biological functions remains unclear. In this study, we identified 1744 high-confidence target genes co-regulated by the transcription factors (TFs) ZmNAC128 and ZmNAC130 (ZmNAC128/130) through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing coupled with RNA-seq analysis in the zmnac128/130 loss-of-function mutants. We further constructed a hierarchical regulatory network using DNA affinity purification sequencing analysis of downstream TFs regulated by ZmNAC128/130. In addition to target genes involved in the biosynthesis of starch and zeins, we discovered novel target genes of ZmNAC128/130 involved in the biosynthesis of lipids and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Consistently, the number of oil bodies, as well as the contents of triacylglycerol, and IAA were significantly reduced in zmnac128/130. The hierarchical regulatory network centered by ZmNAC128/130 revealed a significant overlap between the direct target genes of ZmNAC128/130 and their downstream TFs, particularly in regulating the biosynthesis of storage reserves and IAA. Our results indicated that the biosynthesis of storage reserves and IAA is coordinated by a multi-TFs hierarchical regulatory network in maize endosperm."
38965812,mycorrhizal infection,Differential root and cell regulation of maize aquaporins by the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis highlights its role in plant water relations.,"This study aims to elucidate if the regulation of plant aquaporins by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis occurs only in roots or cells colonized by the fungus or at whole root system. Maize plants were cultivated in a split-root system, with half of the root system inoculated with the AM fungus and the other half uninoculated. Plant growth and hydraulic parameters were measured and aquaporin gene expression was determined in each root fraction and in microdissected cells. Under well-watered conditions, the non-colonized root fractions of AM plants grew more than the colonized root fraction. Total osmotic and hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivities (Lo and Lpr) were higher in AM plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants. The expression of most maize aquaporin genes analysed was different in the mycorrhizal root fraction than in the non-mycorrhizal root fraction of AM plants. At the cellular level, differential aquaporin expression in AM-colonized cells and in uncolonized cells was also observed. Results indicate the existence of both, local and systemic regulation of plant aquaporins by the AM symbiosis and suggest that such regulation is related to the availability of water taken up by fungal hyphae in each root fraction and to the plant need of water mobilization."
38970337,stomatal conductance; water use efficiency,Differences in stomatal sensitivity to CO2 and light influence variation in water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope composition in two genotypes of the C4 plant Zea mays.,"The ratio of net CO2 uptake (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gs) is an intrinsic measurement of leaf water use efficiency (WUEi) however its measurement can be challenging for large phenotypic screens. Measurements of leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13Cleaf) may be a scalable tool to approximate WUEi for screening because it in part reflects the competing influences of Anet and gs on the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) inside the leaf over time. However, in C4 photosynthesis the CO2 concentrating mechanism complicates the relationship between δ13Cleaf and WUEi. Despite this complicated relationship, several studies have shown genetic variation in δ13Cleaf across C4 plants. Yet there has not been a clear demonstration of whether Anet or gs are the causal mechanisms controlling WUEi and δ13Cleaf. Our approach was to characterize leaf photosynthetic traits of two Zea mays recombinant inbred lines (Z007E0067 and Z007E0150) which consistently differ for δ13Cleaf even though they have minimal confounding genetic differences. We demonstrate that these two genotypes contrasted in WUEi driven by differences in the speed of stomatal responses to changes in pCO2 and light that lead to unproductive leaf water loss. These findings provide support that differences in δ13Cleaf in closely related genotypes do reflect greater WUEi and further suggests that differences in stomatal kinetic response to changing environmental conditions is a key target to improve WUEi. 
Highlight: Leaf-level water use efficiency in C4 plants is driven by the speed of stomatal movement in response to light and CO2."
38970454,root morphology; nitrogen use efficiency,Root plasticity improves maize nitrogen use when nitrogen is limiting - an analysis using 3D plant modelling.,"Plant phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in nitrogen (N) acquisition and use under nitrogen-limited conditions. However, this role has never been quantified as a function of N availability, leaving it unclear whether plastic responses should be considered as potential targets for selection. A combined modelling and experimentation approach was adopted to quantify the role of plasticity on N uptake and plant yield. Based on a greenhouse experiment we considered plasticity in two maize traits: root-to-leaf biomass allocation ratio and emergence rate of axial roots. In a simulation experiment we individually enabled or disabled both plastic responses for maize stands grown across six N levels. Both plastic responses contributed to maintaining a higher N uptake and plant productivity as N-availability declined, compared to stands in which plastic responses were disabled. We conclude that plastic responses quantified in this study may be a potential target trait in breeding programs for greater N uptake across N levels while it may only be important for the internal use of N under N-limited conditions in maize. Given the complexity of breeding for plastic responses, an a priori model analysis is useful to identify which plastic traits to target for enhanced plant performance."
38973063,phosphorus content; mycorrhizal infection,Maize zinc uptake is influenced by arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis under various soil phosphorus availabilities.,"The antagonistic interplay between phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) in plants is well established. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating those interactions as influenced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis remain unclear. We investigated Zn concentrations, root AM symbiosis, and transcriptome profiles of maize roots grown under field conditions upon different P levels. We also validated genotype-dependent P-Zn uptake in selected genotypes from a MAGIC population and conducted mycorrhizal inoculation experiments using mycorrhizal-defective mutant pht1;6 to elucidate the significance of AM symbiosis in P-Zn antagonism. Finally, we assessed how P supply affects Zn transporters and Zn uptake in extraradical hyphae within a three-compartment system. Elevated P levels led to a significant reduction in maize Zn concentration across the population, correlating with a marked decline in AM symbiosis, thus elucidating the P-Zn antagonism. We also identified ZmPht1;6 is crucial for AM symbiosis and confirmed that P-Zn antagonistic uptake is dependent on AM symbiosis. Moreover, we found that high P suppressed the expression of the fungal RiZRT1 and RiZnT1 genes, potentially impacting hyphal Zn uptake. We conclude that high P exerts systemic regulation over root and AM hyphae-mediated Zn uptake in maize. These findings hold implications for breeding Zn deficiency-tolerant maize varieties."
38980762,drought response; response to heat stress; Abiotic stress response,Leveraging Multiomics Insights and Exploiting Wild Relatives’ Potential for Drought and Heat Tolerance in Maize,"Climate change, particularly drought and heat stress, may slash agricultural productivity by 25.7% by 2080, with maize being the hardest hit. Therefore, unraveling the molecular nature of plant responses to these stressors is vital for the development of climate-smart maize. This manuscript’s primary objective was to examine how maize plants respond to these stresses, both individually and in combination. Additionally, the paper delved into harnessing the potential of maize wild relatives as a valuable genetic resource and leveraging AI-based technologies to boost maize resilience. The role of multiomics approaches particularly genomics and transcriptomics in dissecting the genetic basis of stress tolerance was also highlighted. The way forward was proposed to utilize a bunch of information obtained through omics technologies by an interdisciplinary state-of-the-art forward-looking big-data, cyberagriculture system, and AI-based approach to orchestrate the development of climate resilient maize genotypes."
38982675,response to Bipolaris maydis,A novel member of miR169 family negatively regulates maize resistance against Bipolaris maydis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to play important roles in plant defense response. However, the key maize miRNAs involved in the defense response against Bipolaris maydis are very limited. In this study, a novel member of the miR169 family in response to B. maydis, named zma-miR169s, was discovered and investigated. The expression levels of pre-miR169s and zma-miR169s were significantly repressed during B. maydis infection. CRISPR/Cas9-induced zma-miR169s mutant exhibited more resistance against B. maydis, whereas overexpression zma-miR169s enhanced susceptibility, supporting that zma-miR169s might play a negative role in maize resistance. Moreover, RNA-seq and GO analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were highly enriched in the oxidation-reduction process and plant hormone pathway. Hence, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plant hormone levels were further investigated. ROS detection confirmed that zma-miR169s mutant accumulated more ROS, while less ROS was detected in transgenic maize OE-miR169s. Furthermore, more remarkable changes in PR-1 expression levels and salicylic acid (SA) contents were detected in zma-miR169s mutant compared to wild-type and transgenic maize during B. maydis infection. Additionally, nuclear transcription factors (NF-YA1 and NF-YA13) were identified as targets regulated by zma-miR169s through the agrobacterium-mediated transient expression method. Overexpression of ZmNF-YA13 enhanced Arabidopsis resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Taken together, our results suggest that zma-miR169s negatively regulate maize defense responses by influencing ROS accumulation and the SA-dependent signaling pathway."
38985786,cytoplasmic male sterility,Pentatricopeptide repeat 153 (PPR153) restores maize C-type cytoplasmic male sterility in conjunction with RF4.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) C-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-C) is a highly used CMS system for maize commercial hybrid seed production. Rf4 is the major dominant restorer gene for CMS-C. Inbreds were recently discovered which contain the restoring Rf4 allele yet are unable to restore fertility due to the lack of an additional gene required for Rf4's restoration. To find this additional gene, QTL mapping and positional cloning were performed using an inbred that contained Rf4 but was incapable of restoring CMS-C. The QTL was mapped to a 738-kb interval on chromosome 2, which contains a Pentatricopeptide Repeat (PPR) gene cluster. Allele content comparisons of the inbreds identified three potential candidate genes responsible for fertility restoration in CMS-C. Complementation via transformation of these three candidate genes showed that PPR153 (Zm00001eb114660) is required for Rf4 to restore fertility to tassels. The PPR153 sequence is present in B73 genome, but it is not capable of restoring CMS-C without Rf4. Analysis using NAM lines revealed that Rf4 requires the presence of PPR153 to restore CMS-C in diverse germplasms. This research uncovers a major CMS-C genetic restoration pathway and can be used for identifying inbreds suitable for maize hybrid production with CMS-C cytoplasm."
38990624,fatty acid content; oil composition; oil content  kernel,"Enhancing kernel oil and tailoring fatty acid composition by genomics-assisted selection for dgat1-2 and fatb genes in multi-nutrient-rich maize: new avenue for food, feed and bioenergy.","Enhancing maize kernel oil is vital for improving the bioavailability of fat-soluble vitamins. Here, we combined favourable alleles of dgat1-2 and fatb into parental lines of four multi-nutrient-rich maize hybrids (APTQH1, APTQH4, APTQH5 and APTQH7) using marker-assisted selection (MAS). Parental lines possessed favourable alleles of crtRB1, lcyE, vte4 and opaque2 genes. Gene-specific markers enabled successful foreground selection in BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC2F2, while background selection using genome-wide microsatellite markers (127-132) achieved 93% recurrent parent genome recovery. Resulting inbreds exhibited significantly higher oil (6.93%) and oleic acid (OA, 40.49%) and lower palmitic acid (PA, 14.23%) compared to original inbreds with elevated provitamin A (11.77 ppm), vitamin E (16.01 ppm), lysine (0.331%) and tryptophan (0.085%). Oil content significantly increased from 4.80% in original hybrids to 6.73% in reconstituted hybrids, making them high-oil maize hybrids. These hybrids displayed 35.70% increment in oil content and 51.56% increase in OA with 36.32% reduction in PA compared to original hybrids, while maintaining higher provitamin A (two-fold), vitamin E (nine-fold), lysine (two-fold) and tryptophan (two-fold) compared to normal hybrids. Lipid health indices showed improved atherogenicity, thrombogenicity, cholesterolaemic, oxidability, peroxidizability and nutritive values in MAS-derived genotypes over original versions. Besides, the MAS-derived inbreds and hybrids exhibited comparable grain yield and phenotypic characteristics to the original versions. The maize hybrids developed in the study possessed high-yielding ability with high kernel oil and OA, low PA, better fatty acid health and nutritional properties, higher multi-vitamins and balanced amino acids, which hold immense significance to address malnutrition and rising demand for oil sustainably in a fast-track manner."
38999603,response to heavy metals,Melatonin-Induced Chromium Tolerance Requires Hydrogen Sulfide Signaling in Maize.,"Both melatonin and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mitigate chromium (Cr) toxicity in plants, but the specific interaction between melatonin and H2S in Cr detoxification remains unclear. In this study, the interaction between melatonin and H2S in Cr detoxification was elucidated by measuring cell wall polysaccharide metabolism and antioxidant enzyme activity in maize. The findings revealed that exposure to Cr stress (100 μM K2Cr2O7) resulted in the upregulation of L-/D-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD/DCD) gene expression, leading to a 77.8% and 27.3% increase in endogenous H2S levels in maize leaves and roots, respectively. Similarly, the endogenous melatonin system is activated in response to Cr stress. We found that melatonin had a significant impact on the relative expression of LCD/DCD, leading to a 103.3% and 116.7% increase in endogenous H2S levels in maize leaves and roots, respectively. In contrast, NaHS had minimal effects on the relative mRNA expression of serotonin-Nacetyltransferase (SNAT) and endogenous melatonin levels. The production of H2S induced by melatonin is accompanied by an increase in Cr tolerance, as evidenced by elevated gene expression, elevated cell wall polysaccharide content, increased pectin methylesterase activity, and improved antioxidant enzyme activity. The scavenging of H2S decreases the melatonin-induced Cr tolerance, while the inhibitor of melatonin synthesis, p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), has minimal impact on H2S-induced Cr tolerance. In conclusion, our findings suggest that H2S serves as a downstream signaling molecule involved in melatonin-induced Cr tolerance in maize."

The timely and accurate identification of maize leaf diseases and pests is of great significance for ensuring agricultural production. Currently, the identification of maize leaf diseases and pests faces two key challenges: (1) In the actual process of identifying leaf diseases and pests, complex backgrounds can interfere with the identification effect. (2) The subtle features of diseases and pests are difficult to accurately extract. To address these challenges, this study proposes a maize leaf disease and pest identification model called LFMNet. Firstly, the localized multi-scale inverted residual convolutional block (LMSB) is proposed to perform preliminary down-sampling on the image, preserving important feature information for the subsequent extraction of fine disease and pest features in the model structure. Then, the feature localization bottleneck (FLB) is proposed to improve the model's ability to focus on and locate disease and pest characteristics and to reduce interference from complex backgrounds. Subsequently, the multi-hop local-feature fusion architecture (MLFFA) is proposed, which effectively addresses the problem of extracting subtle features by enhancing the extraction and fusion of global and local disease and pest features in images. After training and testing on a dataset containing 19,451 images of maize leaf diseases and pests, the LFMNet model demonstrated excellent performance, with an average identification accuracy of 95.68%, a precision of 95.91%, a recall of 95.78%, and an F1 score of 95.83%. Compared to existing models, it exhibits significant advantages, offering robust technical support for the precise identification of maize diseases and pests."
38999687,seed vigor,Rupture Test: A New Method for Evaluating Maize (Zea mays) Seed Vigour.,"To explore the application of seed germination biomechanical event(s) in seed vigour tests, a new procedure for the evaluation of maize seed vigour tests based on pericarp-testa rupture (PR) and coleorhiza rupture (CR) during seed germination was developed. Twenty-four lots of hybrid maize were used to determine the feasibility of the rupture test (RT) as a seed vigour test in Zea mays. The results showed that the physiological quality pattern of 24 maize seed lots assessed through RT was similar to that obtained through analysis with other seed test methods. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that the percentage of CR and percentage of PR + CR at ""15 ± 0.5 °C for 120 h ± 1 h"" and ""20 ± 0.5 °C for 72 h ± 15 min"" exhibited positive correlations with the field seedling emergence data (p < 0.01). Hence, the proposed method (the rupture test) is cogent and effective, thus providing an important reference for more crops to select for seed germination event(s) and establishing corresponding new methods for seed vigour tests in the future."
39002016,response to Cercospora,Quantitative trait locus analysis of gray leaf spot resistance in the maize IBM Syn10 DH population.,"The exploration and dissection of a set of QTLs and candidate genes for gray leaf spot disease resistance using two fully assembled parental genomes may help expedite maize resistance breeding. The fungal disease of maize known as gray leaf spot (GLS), caused by Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina, is a significant concern in China, Southern Africa, and the USA. Resistance to GLS is governed by multiple genes with an additive effect and is influenced by both genotype and environment. The most effective way to reduce the cost of production is to develop resistant hybrids. In this study, we utilized the IBM Syn 10 Doubled Haploid (IBM Syn10 DH) population to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance to gray leaf spot (GLS) in multiple locations. Analysis of seven distinct environments revealed a total of 58 QTLs, 49 of which formed 12 discrete clusters distributed across chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 10. By comparing these findings with published research, we identified colocalized QTLs or GWAS loci within eleven clustering intervals. By integrating transcriptome data with genomic structural variations between parental individuals, we identified a total of 110 genes that exhibit both robust disparities in gene expression and structural alterations. Further analysis revealed 19 potential candidate genes encoding conserved resistance gene domains, including putative leucine-rich repeat receptors, NLP transcription factors, fucosyltransferases, and putative xyloglucan galactosyltransferases. Our results provide a valuable resource and linked loci for GLS marker resistance selection breeding in maize."
39021059,response to Ustilago maydis,Tip of the iceberg? Three novel TOPLESS-interacting effectors of the gall-inducing fungus Ustilago maydis.,"Ustilago maydis is a biotrophic pathogen causing smut disease in maize. It secretes a cocktail of effector proteins, which target different host proteins during its biotrophic stages in the host plant. One such class of proteins we identified previously is TOPLESS (TPL) and TOPLESS-RELATED (TPR) transcriptional corepressors. Here, we screened 297 U. maydis effector candidates for their ability to interact with maize TPL protein RAMOSA 1 ENHANCER LOCUS 2 LIKE 2 (RELK2) and their ability to induce auxin signaling and thereby identified three novel TPL-interacting protein effectors (Tip6, Tip7, and Tip8). Structural modeling and mutational analysis allowed the identification of TPL-interaction motifs of Tip6 and Tip7. In planta interaction between Tip6 and Tip7 with RELK2 occurs mainly in nuclear compartments, whereas Tip8 colocalizes with RELK2 in a compartment outside the nucleus. Overexpression of Tip8 in nonhost plants leads to cell death, indicating recognition of the effector or its activity. By performing infection assays with single and multideletion mutants of U. maydis, we demonstrate a positive role of Tip6 and Tip7 in U. maydis virulence. Transcriptional profiling of maize leaves infected with Tip effector mutants in comparison with SG200 strain suggests Tip effector activities are not merely redundant."
39024420,response to cold stress,Genetic variation in the aquaporin TONOPLAST INTRINSIC PROTEIN 4;3 modulates maize cold tolerance.,"Cold stress is a major abiotic stress that threatens maize (Zea mays L.) production worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance is crucial for breeding resilient maize varieties. Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) are a subfamily of aquaporins in plants. Here, we report that TIP family proteins are involved in maize cold tolerance. The expression of most TIP genes was responsive to cold stress. Overexpressing TIP2;1, TIP3;2 or TIP4;3 reduced the cold tolerance of maize seedlings, while loss-of-function mutants of TIP4;3 exhibited enhanced cold tolerance. Candidate gene-based association analysis revealed that a 328-bp transposon insertion in the promoter region of TIP4;3 was strongly associated with maize cold tolerance. This transposon insertion conferred cold tolerance by repressing TIP4;3 expression through increased methylation of its promoter region. Moreover, TIP4;3 was found to suppress stomatal closure and facilitate reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under cold stress, thereby inhibiting the expression of cold-responsive genes, including DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING FACTOR 1 (DREB1) genes and a subset of peroxidase genes, ultimately attenuating maize cold tolerance. This study thus elucidates the mechanism underlying TIP-mediated cold tolerance and identifies a favourable TIP4;3 allele as a potential genetic resource for breeding cold-tolerant maize varieties."
39031128,cuticular lipids,Cuticle Development And The Underlying Transcriptome-Metabolome Associations During Early Seedling Establishment.,"The plant cuticle is a complex extracellular lipid barrier that has multiple protective functions. We investigated cuticle deposition by integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics data gathered from six different maize seedling organs of four genotypes, the inbred lines B73 and Mo17, and their reciprocal hybrids. These datasets captured the developmental transition of the seedling from heterotrophic skotomorphogenic growth to autotrophic photomorphogenic growth, which is a transition that is highly vulnerable to environmental stresses. Statistical interrogation of these data reveals that the predominant determinant of cuticle composition is seedling organ type, whereas the seedling genotype has a smaller effect on this phenotype. Gene-to-metabolite associations assessed by integrated statistical analyses identified three gene networks connected with the deposition of different elements of the cuticle: a) cuticular waxes; b) monomers of lipidized cell wall biopolymers, including cutin and suberin; and c) both of these elements. These gene networks reveal three metabolic programs that appear to support cuticle deposition, including processes of chloroplast biogenesis, lipid metabolism, and molecular regulation (e.g., transcription factors, post-translational regulators and phytohormones). This study demonstrates the wider physiological metabolic context that can determine cuticle deposition and lays the groundwork for new targets for modulating properties of this protective barrier."
39034891,drought response,Integrating GWAS with a gene co-expression network better prioritizes candidate genes associated with root metaxylem phenes in maize.,"Root metaxylems are phenotypically diverse structures whose function is particularly important under drought stress. Significant research has dissected the genetic machinery underlying metaxylem phenotypes in dicots, but that of monocots are relatively underexplored. In maize (Zea mays), a robust pipeline integrated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of root metaxylem phenes under well-watered and water-stress conditions with a gene co-expression network to prioritize the strongest gene candidates. We identified 244 candidate genes by GWAS, of which 103 reside in gene co-expression modules most relevant to xylem development. Several candidate genes may be involved in biosynthetic processes related to the cell wall, hormone signaling, oxidative stress responses, and drought responses. Of those, six gene candidates were detected in multiple root metaxylem phenes in both well-watered and water-stress conditions. We posit that candidate genes that are more essential to network function based on gene co-expression (i.e., hubs or bottlenecks) should be prioritized and classify 33 essential genes for further investigation. Our study demonstrates a new strategy for identifying promising gene candidates and presents several gene candidates that may enhance our understanding of vascular development and responses to drought in cereals."
39037027,drought response,ZmPHR1 contributes to drought resistance by modulating phosphate homeostasis in maize.,"As an essential macronutrient, phosphorus (P) is often a limiting nutrient because of its low availability and mobility in soils. Drought is a major environmental stress that reduces crop yield. How plants balance and combine P-starvation responses (PSRs) and drought resistance is unclear. In this study, we identified the transcription factor ZmPHR1 as a major regulator of PSRs that modulates phosphate (Pi) signaling and homeostasis. We found that maize zmphr1 mutants had reduced P concentration and were sensitive to Pi starvation, whereas ZmPHR1-OE lines displayed elevated Pi concentration and yields. In addition, 57% of PSR genes and nearly 70% of ZmPHR1-regulated PSR genes in leaves were transcriptionally responsive to drought. Under moderate and early drought conditions, the Pi concentration of maize decreased, and PSR genes were up-regulated before drought-responsive genes. The ZmPHR1-OE lines exhibited drought-resistant phenotypes and reduced stomatal apertures, whereas the opposite was true of the zmphr1 mutants. ZmPT7-OE lines and zmspx3 mutants, which had elevated Pi concentration, also exhibited drought resistance, but zmpt7 mutants were sensitive to drought. Our results suggest that ZmPHR1 plays a central role in integrating Pi and drought signals and that Pi homeostasis improves the ability of maize to combat drought."
39039220,response to fall armyworm,Jasmonic Acid and Salicylic Acid improved resistance against Spodoptera frugiperda Infestation in maize by modulating growth and regulating redox homeostasis.,"Exploring host plant resistance and elevating plant defense mechanisms through the application of exogenous elicitors stands as a promising strategy for integrated pest management. The fall armyworm, a pernicious menace to grain crops in tropical and subtropical regions, stands as a formidable threat due to its capacity for devastation and a wide-ranging spectrum of host plants. There is no literature regarding artificially induced resistance in maize against fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) by exogenous application of phytohormones. The present investigation was performed to evaluate the role of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) on two maize hybrids namely FH-1046 and YH-1898 against fall armyworm. Results showed that plant height, biomass and lengths, fresh and dry weight of root shoot which decreased with armyworm infestation improved with phytohormonal application. JA treatment resulted in a higher increase in all attributes as compared to SA treatment. Improvement in relative water contents, photosynthetic pigments and pronounced levels of phenol and proline accumulation were observed in infested plants after JA treatment. Infested plants recovered from oxidative stress as JA application activated and increased the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity in both FH-1046 and YH-1898 . The oxidative stress reduction in infested plants after JA treatment was also evident from a fair decrease in MDA and H2O2 in both varieties. The SA and JA mediated genes expression was studied and it was found that in FH1046 maize cultivar, JA dependent genes, particularly marker genes PR1 and Lox5 were highly expressed along with TPS10 and BBT12. Whereas SPI, WRKY28, ICS and PAL were shown to be activated upon SA application. Evidently, both JA and SA elicited a robust defensive response within the maize plants against the voracious S. frugiperda, which in consequence exerted a discernible influence over the pest's developmental trajectory and physiological dynamics. A decrease in detoxification enzyme activity of the insects was observed after feeding on treated plants. Moreover, it was recorded that the survival and weight gain of FAW feeding on phytohormone treated maize plants also decelerated. In conclusion, FH-1046 was found to be more tolerant than YH-1898 against fall armyworm infestation and 1 mM JA was more effective than 1 mM SA for alleviation of fall armyworm stress. Therefore, it was inferred that phytohormones regulated redox homeostasis to circumvent oxidative damage and mediate essential metabolic events in maize under stress. To our current understanding, this study is the very first presentation of induced resistance in maize against S. frugiperda with the phytohormonal application (JA and SA)."
39044035,grain yield,Using machine learning to combine genetic and environmental data for maize grain yield predictions across multi-environment trials.,"Incorporating feature-engineered environmental data into machine learning-based genomic prediction models is an efficient approach to indirectly model genotype-by-environment interactions. Complementing phenotypic traits and molecular markers with high-dimensional data such as climate and soil information is becoming a common practice in breeding programs. This study explored new ways to combine non-genetic information in genomic prediction models using machine learning. Using the multi-environment trial data from the Genomes To Fields initiative, different models to predict maize grain yield were adjusted using various inputs: genetic, environmental, or a combination of both, either in an additive (genetic-and-environmental; G+E) or a multiplicative (genotype-by-environment interaction; GEI) manner. When including environmental data, the mean prediction accuracy of machine learning genomic prediction models increased up to 7% over the well-established Factor Analytic Multiplicative Mixed Model among the three cross-validation scenarios evaluated. Moreover, using the G+E model was more advantageous than the GEI model given the superior, or at least comparable, prediction accuracy, the lower usage of computational memory and time, and the flexibility of accounting for interactions by construction. Our results illustrate the flexibility provided by the ML framework, particularly with feature engineering. We show that the feature engineering stage offers a viable option for envirotyping and generates valuable information for machine learning-based genomic prediction models. Furthermore, we verified that the genotype-by-environment interactions may be considered using tree-based approaches without explicitly including interactions in the model. These findings support the growing interest in merging high-dimensional genotypic and environmental data into predictive modeling."
39054427,germination index; response to salt,Effect of seed priming with auxin on ROS detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism and their relationship with germination and early seedling establishment in salt stressed maize.,"As crucial stages in the plant ontogeny, germination and seedling establishment under adverse conditions greatly determine staple crop growth and productivity. In the context of green technologies aiming to improve crop yield, seed priming is emerging as an effective approach to enhance seed vigor and germination performance under salt stress. In this study, we assess the efficiency of seed priming with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings during germination and early seedling stages. In unprimed seeds, salt stress reduced germination indices, and seedling (both radicle and coleoptile) growth, together with decreased tissue hydration. However, seed priming using IAA significantly improved maize salt response, as reflected by the increased seed germination dynamics, early seedling establishment, and water status. Besides, seedlings from IAA-primed seeds showed a higher activity of α-amylase, resulting in increased sugar contents in roots and coleoptiles of salt-stressed plants. Further, IAA-seed priming stimulated the accumulation of endogenous IAA in salt-stressed seedlings, in concomitance with a significant effect on reactive oxygen species detoxification and lipid peroxidation prevention. Indeed, our data revealed increased antioxidant enzyme activities, differentially regulated in roots and coleoptiles, leading to increased activities of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPX). In summary, data gained from this study further highlight the potential of IAA in modulating early interactions between multiple signaling pathways in the seed, endowing maize seedlings with enhanced potential and sustained tolerance to subsequent salt stress."
39057244,response to fall armyworm,Spodoptera frugiperda Salivary Glucose Oxidase Reduces the Release of Green Leaf Volatiles and Increases Terpene Emission from Maize.,"The intricate relationships between plants and insects are essential for understanding ecological dynamics. Among these interactions, HIPVs serve as a pivotal defense mechanism. Our findings reveal the highly conserved nature of the GOX gene within the Lepidoptera order, highly expressed in the salivary glands of S. frugiperda, and its role in mediating maize's defense responses. Notably, salivary GOX activity expression significantly decreases subsequent gene knockout. The presence of GOX in the saliva of S. frugiperda significantly modulates the emission of HIPVs during maize consumption. This research delineates that GOX selectively inhibits the emission of certain green leaf volatiles (GLVs) while concurrently enhancing the release of terpene volatiles. This study unveils a novel mechanism whereby S. frugiperda utilizes GOX proteins in OS to modulate volatile emissions from maize, offering fresh perspectives on the adaptive evolution of phytophagous insects and their interactions with their preferred host plants."
39062894,Abiotic stress response,Genome-Wide Investigation of the CRF Gene Family in Maize and Functional Analysis of ZmCRF9 in Response to Multiple Abiotic Stresses.,"The cytokinin response factors (CRFs) are pivotal players in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to diverse stresses. Despite their significance, comprehensive information on CRF genes in the primary food crop, maize, remains scarce. In this study, a genome-wide analysis of CRF genes in maize was conducted, resulting in the identification of 12 members. Subsequently, we assessed the chromosomal locations, gene duplication events, evolutionary relationships, conserved motifs, and gene structures of all ZmCRF members. Analysis of ZmCRF promoter regions indicated the presence of cis-regulatory elements associated with plant growth regulation, hormone response, and various abiotic stress responses. The expression patterns of maize CRF genes, presented in heatmaps, exhibited distinctive patterns of tissue specificity and responsiveness to multiple abiotic stresses. qRT-PCR experiments were conducted on six selected genes and confirmed the involvement of ZmCRF genes in the plant's adaptive responses to diverse environmental challenges. In addition, ZmCRF9 was demonstrated to positively regulate cold and salt tolerance. Ultimately, we explored the putative interaction partners of ZmCRF proteins. In summary, this systematic overview and deep investigation of ZmCRF9 provides a solid foundation for further exploration into how these genes contribute to the complex interplay of plant growth, development, and responses to stress."
39073158,drought response,Chitosan-fulvic acid nanoparticles enhance drought tolerance in maize via antioxidant defense and transcriptional reprogramming.,"Nanoparticles are promising alternatives to synthetic fertilizers in the context of climate change and sustainable agriculture. Maize plants were grown under gradient concentrations (50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, 500 μM, and 1 mM) of chitosan (Ch), fulvic acid (FA) or chitosan-fulvic acid nanoparticles (Ch-FANPs). Based on the overall phenotypic assessment, 100 μM was selected for downstream experiments. Maize plants grown under this optimized concentration were thereafter subjected to drought stress by water withholding for 14 days. Compared to the individual performances, the combined treatment of Ch-FANPs supported the best plant growth over chitosan, fulvic acid, or sole watered plants and alleviated the adverse effects of drought by enhancing root and shoot growth, and biomass by an average 20%. In addition, Ch-FANPs-treated plants exhibited a significant reduction in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content (~10%), with a concomitant increase in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity (>100%) while showing a reduced lipid peroxidation level observed by the decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (~100%) and low electrolyte leakage level. Furthermore, chlorophyll content increased significantly (>100%) in maize plants treated with Ch-FANPs compared to Ch or FA and control in response to drought. The expression of drought-induced transcription factors, ZmDREB1A, ZmbZIP1, and ZmNAC28, and the ABA-dependent ZmCIPK3 was upregulated by Ch-FANPs. Owing to the above, Ch-FANPs are proposed as a growth-promoting agent and elicitor of drought tolerance in maize via activation of antioxidant machinery and transcriptional reprogramming of drought-related genes."
39074204,response to heavy metals,A phased small interfering RNA-derived pathway mediates lead stress tolerance in maize,"Phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are a distinct class of endogenous small interfering RNAs, which regulate plant growth, development and environmental stress response. To determine the effect of phasiRNAs on maize (Zea mays L.) tolerance to lead (Pb) stress, the roots of 305 maize lines under Pb treatment were subjected to generation of individual databases of small RNAs. We identified 55 high-confidence phasiRNAs derived from 13 PHAS genes (genes producing phasiRNAs) in this maize panel, of which 41 derived from nine PHAS loci were negatively correlated with Pb content in the roots. The potential targets of the 41 phasiRNAs were enriched in ion transport and import. Only the expression of PHAS_1 (ZmTAS3j, Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3) was regulated by its cis-expression quantitative trait locus and thus affected the Pb content in the roots. Using the Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) transient expression system, 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and Arabidopsis heterologously expressed, we verified that ZmTAS3j was cleaved by zma-miR390 and thus generated tasiRNA targeting ARF genes (tasiARFs), and that the 5' and 3' zma-miR390 target sites of ZmTAS3j were both necessary for efficient biosynthesis and functional integrity of tasiARFs. We validated the involvement of the zma-miR390–ZmTAS3j–tasiARF–ZmARF3–ZmHMA3 pathway in Pb accumulation in maize seedlings using genetic, molecular, and cytological methods. Moreover, the increased Pb tolerance in ZmTAS3j-overexpressed lines was likely attributed to the zma-miR390–ZmTAS3j–tasiARF–ZmARF3–SAURs pathway, which elevated indole acetic acid levels and thus reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity in maize roots. Our study reveals the importance of the TAS3-derived tasiRNA pathway in plant adaptation to Pb stress."
39077120,leaf area; radiation use efficiency (RUE),Maximizing the Radiation Use Efficiency by Matching the Leaf Area and Leaf Nitrogen Vertical Distributions in a Maize Canopy: A Simulation Study.,"The radiation use efficiency (RUE) is one of the most important functional traits determining crop productivity. The coordination of the vertical distribution of light and leaf nitrogen has been proven to be effective in boosting the RUE from both experimental and computational evidence. However, previous simulation studies have primarily assumed that the leaf area is uniformly distributed along the canopy depth, rarely considering the optimization of the leaf area distribution, especially for C4 crops. The present study hypothesizes that the RUE may be maximized by matching the leaf area and leaf nitrogen vertical distributions in the canopy. To test this hypothesis, various virtual maize canopies were generated by combining the leaf inclination angle, vertical leaf area distribution, and vertical leaf nitrogen distribution and were further evaluated by an improved multilayer canopy photosynthesis model. We found that a greater fraction of leaf nitrogen is preferentially allocated to canopy layers with greater leaf areas to maximize the RUE. The coordination of light and nitrogen emerged as a property from the simulations to maximize the RUE in most scenarios, particularly in dense canopies. This study not only facilitates explicit and precise profiling of ideotypes for maximizing the RUE but also represents a primary step toward high-throughput phenotyping and screening of the RUE for massive numbers of inbred lines and cultivars."
39080512,hormone response; response to Gibberella ear rot,Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and defense-related phytohormones to discover hub genes conferring maize Gibberella ear rot caused by Fusarium Graminearum.,"Background: Gibberella ear rot (GER) is one of the most devastating diseases in maize growing areas, which directly reduces grain yield and quality. However, the underlying defense response of maize to pathogens infection is largely unknown. 

Results: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the defense response in GER resistance, two contrasting inbred lines 'Nov-82' and 'H10' were used to explore transcriptomic profiles and defense-related phytohormonal alterations during Fusarium graminearum infection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 4,417 and 4,313 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the Nov-82 and H10, respectively, and 647 common DEGs between the two lines. More DEGs were obviously enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, metabolic process and defense-related pathways. In addition, the concentration of the defense-related phytohormones, jasmonates (JAs) and salicylates (SAs), was greatly induced after the pathogen infection. The level of JAs in H10 was more higher than in Nov-82, whereas an opposite pattern for the SA between the both lines. Integrated analysis of the DEGs and the phytohormones revealed five vital modules based on co-expression network analysis according to their correlation. A total of 12 hub genes encoding fatty acid desaturase, subtilisin-like protease, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, and sugar transport protein were captured from the key modules, indicating that these genes might play unique roles in response to pathogen infection, CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicate that large number DEGs related to plant disease resistance and different alteration of defensive phytohormones were activated during F. graminearum infection, providing new insight into the defense response against pathogen invasion, in addition to the identified hub genes that can be further investigated for enhancing maize GER resistance."
39083002,"Phenology; response to European corn borer, 1st",Effects of maize development and phenology on the field infestation dynamics of the European corn borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae).,"Phenological match/mismatch between cultivated plants and their pest could impact pest infestation dynamics in the field. To explore how such match/mismatch of plant and pest phenologies may interact with plant defense dynamics, we studied the infestation dynamics of maize by one of its main pests in Europe, the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis; Lepidoptera: Crambidae). A two-year field experiment was carried out on a collection of 23 maize inbred lines contrasted for their earliness. Each inbred line was sown at three different dates in order to expose different developmental stages of maize to natural European corn borer infestation. The effect of the sowing date depended on the inbred line, the pest generation, and the year. In 2021, the final pest incidence ranged from 36% to 91% depending on inbred lines and sowing date. In 2022, it ranged from 2% to 77%. This variability in final pest incidence can be related to variations in plant development during plant exposure to pest infestation. However, this relationship was not straightforward. Indeed, the shape and intensity of the relationship depended on the timing of the onset of the pest infestation. When infestation occurred while plants were in a vegetative stage, a nonlinear relationship between development and pest incidence was observed with the least and most developed plants being the most infested. When infestation occurred when all plants were in the mature phase, the most developed plants were the least infested. Our results highlight the effect of plant-pest phenological match/mismatch on pest infestation dynamics and underline the importance of taking plant-pest interactions into account to propose relevant control strategies."
39094478,response to heat stress,Genome editing prospects for heat stress tolerance in cereal crops.,"The world population is steadily growing, exerting increasing pressure to feed in the future, which would need additional production of major crops. Challenges associated with changing and unpredicted climate (such as heat waves) are causing global food security threats. Cereal crops are a staple food for a large portion of the world's population. They are mostly affected by these environmentally generated abiotic stresses. Therefore, it is imperative to develop climate-resilient cultivars to support the sustainable production of main cereal crops (Rice, wheat, and maize). Among these stresses, heat stress causes significant losses to major cereals. These issues can be solved by comprehending the molecular mechanisms of heat stress and creating heat-tolerant varieties. Different breeding and biotechnology techniques in the last decade have been employed to develop heat-stress-tolerant varieties. However, these time-consuming techniques often lack the pace required for varietal improvement in climate change scenarios. Genome editing technologies offer precise alteration in the crop genome for developing stress-resistant cultivars. CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9), one such genome editing platform, recently got scientists' attention due to its easy procedures. It is a powerful tool for functional genomics as well as crop breeding. This review will focus on the molecular mechanism of heat stress and different targets that can be altered using CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools to generate climate-smart cereal crops. Further, heat stress signaling and essential players have been highlighted to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. 
Highlights:
    •    Challenges associated with changing and unpredicted climate (such as heat waves) are causing global food security threats due to cereal crop susceptibility. 
    •    Genome editing technologies offer precise alteration in the crop genome for developing heat stress-resistant cultivars. 
    •    This review highlights different targets associated with heat stress that can be altered using CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools to generate climate-smart cereal crops."
39095994,response to cold stress,Genetic variation in a heat shock transcription factor modulates cold tolerance in maize.,"Understanding how maize (Zea mays L.) responds to cold stress is crucial for facilitating breeding programs of cold-tolerant varieties. Despite the extensive utilization of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach in exploring favorable natural alleles associated with maize cold tolerance, there are few reports that have successfully identified the candidate genes contributing to maize cold tolerance. In this study, by employing a diverse panel of maize inbred lines collected from different germplasm sources, we conducted a GWAS on the variation of the relative injured area of maize true leaves during cold stress-a trait most closely correlated with maize cold tolerance-and identified HSF21, encoding a B-class heat shock transcription factor, which positively regulates cold tolerance at both seedling and germination stages. The natural variations within the promoter of the cold-tolerant HSF21Hap1 allele led to increased HSF21 expression under cold stress by inhibiting the binding of bZIP68 transcription factor, a negative regulator of cold tolerance. Through integrated transcriptome deep sequencing, DNA affinity purification sequencing, and targeted lipidomic analysis, we unveiled the function of HSF21 in regulating lipid metabolism homeostasis for modulating cold tolerance in maize. Additionally, HSF21 confers maize cold tolerance without incurring yield penalties. This study thereby establishes HSF21 as a key regulator that enhances cold tolerance in maize, thus providing valuable genetic resources for the breeding of cold-tolerant maize varieties."
39099140,plant height,Genome-wide association studies from spoken phenotypic descriptions: a proof of concept from maize field studies.,"We present a novel approach to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by leveraging unstructured, spoken phenotypic descriptions to identify genomic regions associated with maize traits. Utilizing the Wisconsin Diversity panel, we collected spoken descriptions of Zea mays ssp. mays traits, converting these qualitative observations into quantitative data amenable to GWAS analysis. First, we determined that visually striking phenotypes could be detected from unstructured spoken phenotypic descriptions. Next, we developed two methods to process the same descriptions to derive the trait plant height, a well-characterized phenotypic feature in maize: (1) a semantic similarity metric that assigns a score based on the resemblance of each observation to the concept of 'tallness' and (2) a manual scoring system that categorizes and assigns values to phrases related to plant height. Our analysis successfully corroborated known genomic associations and uncovered novel candidate genes potentially linked to plant height. Some of these genes are associated with gene ontology terms that suggest a plausible involvement in determining plant stature. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the viability of spoken phenotypic descriptions in GWAS and introduces a scalable framework for incorporating unstructured language data into genetic association studies. This methodology has the potential not only to enrich the phenotypic data used in GWAS and to enhance the discovery of genetic elements linked to complex traits but also to expand the repertoire of phenotype data collection methods available for use in the field environment."
39112960,response to ultrasonic treatment; Abiotic stress response; germination index,Ultrasonic treatment can improve maize seed germination and abiotic stress resistance.,"Constant-frequency ultrasonic treatment helped to improve seed germination. However, variable-frequency ultrasonic treatment on maize seed germination were rarely reported. In this study, maize seeds were exposed to 20-40 kHz ultrasonic for 40 s. The germination percentage and radicle length of maize seeds increased by 10.4% and 230.5%. Ultrasonic treatment also significantly increased the acid protease, α-amylase, and β-amylase contents by 96.4%, 73.8%, and 49.1%, respectively. Transcriptome analysis showed that 11,475 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the ultrasonic treatment and control groups, including 5,695 upregulated and 5,780 downregulated. Metabolic pathways and transcription factors (TFs) were significantly enriched among DEGs after ultrasonic treatment. This included metabolism and genetic information processing, that is, ribosome, proteasome, and pyruvate metabolism, sesquiterpenoid, triterpenoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as transcription factors in the NAC, MYB, bHLH, WRKY, AP2, bZIP, and ARF families. Variable-frequency ultrasonic treatment increased auxin, gibberellin, and salicylic acid by 5.5%, 37.3%, and 28.9%, respectively. Abscisic acid significantly decreased by 33.2%. The related DEGs were upregulated and downregulated to varying degrees. Seed germination under the abiotic stress conditions of salt stress (NaCl solution), drought (PEG solution), and waterlogging (water-saturated sand bed) under ultrasonic treatment were promoted, radicle length was significantly increased by 30.2%, 30.5%, and 27.3%, respectively; and germination percentage by 14.8%, 20.1%, and 21.6%, respectively. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms through ultrasonic to promote maize seed germination."
39129203,response to Striga,Genomic Prediction of The Performance of Tropical Doubled Haploid Maize Lines under Artificial Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. Infestation.,"Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth., a parasitic weed, causes substantial yield losses in maize production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Breeding for Striga resistance in maize is constrained by limited genetic diversity for Striga resistance within the elite germplasm and phenotyping capacity under artificial Striga infestation. Genomics-enabled approaches have the potential to accelerate identification of Striga resistant lines for hybrid development. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of genomic selection for traits associated with Striga resistance and grain yield (GY) and to predict genetic values of tested and untested doubled haploid (DH) maize lines. We genotyped 606 DH lines with 8,439 rAmpSeq markers. A training set of 116 DH lines crossed to two testers was phenotyped under artificial Striga infestation at three locations in Kenya. Heritability for Striga resistance parameters ranged from 0.38‒0.65 while that for GY was 0.54. The prediction accuracies for Striga resistance-associated traits across locations, as determined by cross validation (CV) were 0.24 to 0.53 for CV0 and from 0.20 to 0.37 for CV2. For GY, the prediction accuracies were 0.59 and 0.56 for CV0 and CV2, respectively. The results revealed 300 DH lines with desirable genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for reduced number of emerged Striga plants (STR) at 8, 10, and 12 weeks after planting. The GEBVs of DH lines for Striga resistance associated traits in the training and testing sets were similar in magnitude. These results highlight the potential application of genomic selection in breeding for Striga resistance in maize. The integration of genomic-assisted strategies and DH technology for line development coupled with forward breeding for major adaptive traits will enhance genetic gains in breeding for Striga resistance in maize."
39129567,carotenoid content,Genome-wide association study of carotenoids in maize kernel.,"In this study, the contents of four carotenoids in 244 maize inbred lines were detected and about three million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genome-wide association study to preliminarily analyze the genetic mechanism of maize kernel carotenoids. We identified 826 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were significantly associated with carotenoids contents, and two key candidate genes Zm00001d029526 (CYP18) and Zm00001d023336 (wrky91) were obtained. In addition, we found a germplasm IL78 with higher carotenoids. The results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for screening genes that guide kernel carotenoids selection breeding."
39133859,herbicide response,An artificially evolved gene for herbicide-resistant rice breeding.,"Discovering and engineering herbicide-resistant genes is a crucial challenge in crop breeding. This study focuses on the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase Inhibitor Sensitive 1-Like (HSL) protein, prevalent in higher plants and exhibiting weak catalytic activity against many β-triketone herbicides (β-THs). The crystal structures of maize HSL1A complexed with β-THs were elucidated, identifying four essential herbicide-binding residues and explaining the weak activity of HSL1A against the herbicides. Utilizing an artificial evolution approach, we developed a series of rice HSL1 mutants targeting the four residues. Then, these mutants were systematically evaluated, identifying the M10 variant as the most effective in modifying β-THs. The initial active conformation of substrate binding in HSL1 was also revealed from these mutants. Furthermore, overexpression of M10 in rice significantly enhanced resistance to β-THs, resulting in a notable 32-fold increase in resistance to methyl-benquitrione. In conclusion, the artificially evolved M10 gene shows great potential for the development of herbicide-resistant crops.
Significance: 
The discovery and engineering of herbicide-resistant genes represent a critical frontier in modern crop breeding. Here, we focused on unraveling the intricate mechanisms underlying herbicide resistance, particularly within the prevalent 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase Inhibitor Sensitive 1-Like (HSL) protein family. The structures of HSLs complexed with different herbicides not only revealed the initial binding mode of substrate in HSLs, but also explained the catalytic selectivity of some HSL members. From these structures, we identified four residues critical for catalysis. Leveraging an artificial evolution approach, these residues were mutated which significantly enhanced the resistance to β-triketone herbicides in rice. Our findings not only shed light on the catalytic mechanism of HSLs against herbicides but also provide a promising avenue for developing herbicide-resistant crops."
39134924,carotenoid content; response to maize dwarf mosaic virus; phenolic content,Alteration of stress-physiological mechanisms in sRNA-treated sweet corn plants during MDMV infection.,"Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) can significantly reduce the growth and development of susceptible varieties of sweet corn. The virus utilises the energy and reserve sources of plant cells to ensure its reproduction in the microspaces formed by cell membranes. Therefore, the severity of stress can be monitored by examining certain physiological changes, for example, changes in the degree of membrane damage caused by lipid peroxidation, as well as changes in the amount of photosynthetic pigments. The activation of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, glutathione reductase) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties can indirectly protect against the oxidative stress caused by the presence of the positive orientation, single-stranded RNA-virus. This study demonstrates the changes in these physiological processes in a sweet corn hybrid (Zea mays cv. saccharata var. Honey Koern.) susceptible to MDMV infection, and suggests that exogenous small RNA treatment can mitigate the damage caused by virus infection."
39140701,response to heat stress; response to anisiflupurin,"Discovery of anisiflupurin, an inhibitor of cytokinin dehydrogenase that mitigates heat-induced yield reduction in rice.","Background: In a screening of anilinopurine, anisiflupurin was identified as potent inhibitor of cytokinin dehydrogenase/oxidase (CKX). Inhibitors of CKX have been supposed to be potent plant growth regulators to alleviate the detrimental effects of abiotic stress on crop production. The aim of the study was to profile anisiflupurin in a set of physiological assays and to evaluate its potential for heat stress mitigation in rice field trials. Results: Anisiflupurin delayed dark-induced senescence and increased transpiration in detached maize leaves in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the transpiration of young rice plants under heat stress was increased for several days after application with anisiflupurin. Application of anisiflupurin during early phases of generative growth not only restored heat-induced pollen alterations it increased grain yield in field grown rice under heat conditions as demonstrated in a large field program conducted in southeast Asia. Thereby, efficacy of anisiflupurin was rate-dependent and most effective when applied during early generative growth phases prior heat stress. Conclusions: Application of anisiflupurin secures seed setting by protecting pollen development and enhances grain weight under heat stress conditions in rice. The results of this research opens up a promising avenue for mitigating the adverse effects of heat stress in rice cultivation."
39145425,response to corn leaf aphid,Loss-of-function of LIGULELESS1 activates the jasmonate pathway and promotes maize resistance to corn leaf aphids.,"Corn leaf aphids (Rhopalosiphum maidis) are highly destructive pests of maize (Zea mays) that threaten growth and seed yield, but resources for aphid resistance are scarce. Here, we identified an aphid-resistant maize mutant, resistance to aphids 1 (rta1), which is allelic to LIGULELESS1 (LG1). We confirmed LG1's role in aphid resistance using the independent allele lg1-2, allelism tests and LG1 overexpression lines. LG1 interacts with, and increases the stability of ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM (ZIM1), a central component of the jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway, by disturbing its interaction with the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1a (COI1a). Natural variation in the LG1 promoter was associated with aphid resistance among inbred lines. Moreover, a loss-of-function mutant in the LG1-related gene SPL8 in the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana conferred aphid resistance. This study revealed the aphid resistance mechanism of lg1, providing a theoretical basis and germplasm for breeding aphid-resistant crops."
39150575,cytoplasmic male sterility,Insights into cellular crosstalk regulating cytoplasmic male sterility and fertility restoration.,"Cytoplasmic male sterility has been a popular genetic tool in development of hybrids. The molecular mechanism behind maternal sterility varies from crop to crop. An understanding of underlying mechanism can help in development of new functional CMS gene in crops which lack effective and stable CMS systems. In crops where seed or fruit is the commercial product, fertility must be recovered in F1 hybrids so that higher yield gains can be realized. This necessitates the presence of fertility restorer gene (Rf) in nucleus of male parent to overcome the effect of sterile cytoplasm. Fertility restoring genes have been identified in crops like wheat, maize, sunflower, rice, pepper, sugar beet, pigeon pea etc. But in crops like eggplant, bell pepper, barley etc. unstable fertility restorers hamper the use of Cytoplasmic genic male sterility (CGMS) system. Stability of CGMS system is influenced by environment, genetic background or interaction of these factors. This review thus aims to understand the genetic mechanisms controlling mitochondrial-nuclear interactions required to design strong and stable restorers without any pleiotropic effects in F1 hybrids."
39159366,herbicide response,Evolving dual-trait EPSP synthase variants using a synthetic yeast selection system.,"The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) functions in the shikimate pathway which is responsible for the production of aromatic amino acids and precursors of other essential secondary metabolites in all plant species. EPSPS is also the molecular target of the herbicide glyphosate. While some plant EPSPS variants have been characterized with reduced glyphosate sensitivity and have been used in biotechnology, the glyphosate insensitivity typically comes with a cost to catalytic efficiency. Thus, there exists a need to generate additional EPSPS variants that maintain both high catalytic efficiency and high glyphosate tolerance. Here, we create a synthetic yeast system to rapidly study and evolve heterologous EPSP synthases for these dual traits. Using known EPSPS variants, we first validate that our synthetic yeast system is capable of recapitulating growth characteristics observed in plants grown in varying levels of glyphosate. Next, we demonstrate that variants from mutagenesis libraries with distinct phenotypic traits can be isolated depending on the selection criteria applied. By applying strong dual-trait selection pressure, we identify a notable EPSPS mutant after just a single round of evolution that displays robust glyphosate tolerance (Ki of nearly 1 mM) and improved enzymatic efficiency over the starting point (~2.5 fold). Finally, we show the crystal structure of corn EPSPS and the top resulting mutants and demonstrate that certain mutants have the potential to outperform previously reported glyphosate-resistant EPSPS mutants, such as T102I and P106S (denoted as TIPS), in whole-plant testing. Altogether, this platform helps explore the trade-off between glyphosate resistance and enzymatic efficiency. 
Significance: 
Glyphosate is a herbicide that selectively inhibits the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) of the plant shikimate pathway. Mutations within EPSPS enable glyphosate resistance and thus protective capacity to modified crops. However, these mutations decrease basal enzymatic efficiency and can hinder plant growth. In this work, we develop a synthetic yeast selection system that closely simulates growth trends seen in plants and utilize a dual-trait selection strategy to enable the rapid evolution of novel EPSPS variants that confer both improved enzyme properties and glyphosate resistance. Transfection into plants validates this dual phenotype and demonstrates a superior mutant enzyme without imparting growth deficiencies."
39163571,cytoplasmic male sterility,Mutations in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosome proteins restore pollen fertility in S male-sterile maize.,"The interaction of plant mitochondrial and nuclear genetic systems is exemplified by mitochondria-encoded cytoplasmic male sterility under the control of nuclear restorer-of-fertility genes. The S type of cytoplasmic male sterility in maize is characterized by a pollen collapse phenotype and a unique paradigm for fertility restoration in which numerous nuclear restorer-of-fertility lethal mutations rescue pollen function but condition homozygous-lethal seed phenotypes. Two non-allelic restorer mutations recovered from Mutator transposon active lines were investigated to determine the mechanisms of pollen fertility restoration and seed lethality. Mu Illumina sequencing of transposon-flanking regions identified insertion alleles of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins RPL6 and RPL14 as candidate restorer-of-fertility lethal mutations. Both candidates were associated with lowered abundance of mitochondria-encoded proteins in developing maize pollen, and the rpl14 mutant candidate was confirmed by independent insertion alleles. While the restored pollen functioned despite reduced accumulation of mitochondrial respiratory proteins, normal-cytoplasm plants heterozygous for the mutant alleles showed a significant pollen transmission bias in favor of the non-mutant Rpl6 and Rpl14 alleles. CMS-S fertility restoration affords a unique forward genetic approach to investigate the mitochondrial requirements for, and contributions to, pollen and seed development."
39171839,response to Asian corn borer,The plant terpenes DMNT and TMTT function as signaling compounds that attract Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) to maize plants.,"During their co-evolution with herbivorous insects, plants have developed multiple defense strategies that resist pests, such as releasing a blend of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that repel pests or recruit their natural enemies. However, the responses of insects to HIPVs in maize (Zea mays L.) are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Asian corn borer (ACB, Ostrinia furnacalis), a major insect pest of maize, shows a preference for maize pre-infested with ACB larvae rather than being repelled by these plants. Through combined transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis of ACB-infested maize seedlings, we identified two substances that explain this behavior: (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). DMNT and TMTT attracted ACB larvae, and knocking out the maize genes responsible for their biosynthesis via gene editing impaired this attraction. External supplementation with DMNT/TMTT hampered the larvae's ability to locate pre-infested maize. These findings uncover a novel role for DMNT and TMTT in driving the behavior of ACB. Genetic modification of maize to make it less detectable by ACB might be an effective strategy for developing maize germplasm resistant to ACB and for managing this pest effectively in the field."
39184382,drought response,"Inter-subspecies diversity of maize to drought stress with physio-biochemical, enzymatic and molecular responses.","Background: Drought is the most significant factor limiting maize production, given that maize is a crop with a high water demand. Therefore, studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the drought tolerance of maize are of great importance. There are no studies comparing drought tolerance among economically important subspecies of maize. This study aimed to reveal the differences between the physio-biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in dent (Zea mays indentata), popcorn (Zea mays everta), and sugar (Zea mays saccharata) maize under control (no-stress), moderate, and severe drought stress. 

Methods: Three distinct irrigation regimes were employed to assess the impact of varying levels of drought stress on maize plants at the V14 growth stage. These included normal irrigation (80% field capacity), moderate drought (50% field capacity), and severe drought (30% field capacity). All plants were grown under controlled conditions. The following parameters were analyzed: leaf relative water content (RWC), loss of turgidity (LOT), proline (PRO) and soluble protein (SPR) contents, membrane durability index (MDI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT). Additionally, the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was examined at the transcriptional and translational levels. 

Results: The effects of severe drought were more pronounced in sugar maize, which had a relatively high loss of RWC and turgor, membrane damage, enzyme activities, and HSP90 gene expression. Dent maize, which is capable of maintaining its RWC and turgor in both moderate and severe droughts, and employs its defense mechanism effectively by maintaining antioxidant enzyme activities at a certain level despite less MDA and H2O2 accumulation, exhibited relatively high drought tolerance. Despite the high levels of MDA and H2O2 in popcorn maize, the up-regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities and HSP70 gene and protein expression indicated that the drought coping mechanism is activated. In particular, the positive correlation of HSP70 with PRO and HSP90 with enzyme activities is a significant result for studies examining the relationships between HSPs and other stress response systems. The discrepancies between the transcriptional and translational findings provide an opportunity for more comprehensive investigations into the role of HSPs in stress conditions."
39185925,nuclear male sterility,Generation of humidity-sensitive genic male sterility in maize and wheat for hybrid seed production.,"We generated HGMS lines in the two major cereal crops, maize and wheat, based on mutations in the respective PTS1 genes and demonstrated that a two-line hybrid seed production system based on these HGMS lines is a convenient and cost-effective approach for effective utilization of maize heterosis."
39187896,root morphology,TopoRoot+: computing whorl and soil line traits of field-excavated maize roots from CT imaging.,"Background: The use of 3D imaging techniques, such as X-ray CT, in root phenotyping has become more widespread in recent years. However, due to the complexity of the root structure, analyzing the resulting 3D volumes to obtain detailed architectural root traits remains a challenging computational problem. When it comes to image-based phenotyping of excavated maize root crowns, two types of root features that are notably missing from existing methods are the whorls and soil line. Whorls refer to the distinct areas located at the base of each stem node from which roots sprout in a circular pattern (Liu S, Barrow CS, Hanlon M, Lynch JP, Bucksch A. Dirt/3D: 3D root phenotyping for field-grown maize (zea mays). Plant Physiol. 2021;187(2):739-57. https://doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiab311 .). The soil line is where the root stem meets the ground. Knowledge of these features would give biologists deeper insights into the root system architecture (RSA) and the below- and above-ground root properties. 

Results: We developed TopoRoot+, a computational pipeline that produces architectural traits from 3D X-ray CT volumes of excavated maize root crowns. Building upon the TopoRoot software (Zeng D, Li M, Jiang N, Ju Y, Schreiber H, Chambers E, et al. Toporoot: A method for computing hierarchy and fine-grained traits of maize roots from 3D imaging. Plant Methods. 2021;17(1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-021-00829-z .) for computing fine-grained root traits, TopoRoot + adds the capability to detect whorls, identify nodal roots at each whorl, and compute the soil line location. The new algorithms in TopoRoot + offer an additional set of fine-grained traits beyond those provided by TopoRoot. The addition includes internode distances, root traits at every hierarchy level associated with a whorl, and root traits specific to above or below the ground. TopoRoot + is validated on a diverse collection of field-grown maize root crowns consisting of nine genotypes and spanning across three years. TopoRoot + runs in minutes for a typical volume size of [Formula: see text] on a desktop workstation. Our software and test dataset are freely distributed on Github. 

Conclusions: TopoRoot + advances the state-of-the-art in image-based phenotyping of excavated maize root crowns by offering more detailed architectural traits related to whorls and soil lines. The efficiency of TopoRoot + makes it well-suited for high-throughput image-based root phenotyping."
39190817,response to cold stress,Cold mediates maize root hair developmental plasticity via epidermis-specific transcriptomic responses,"Cold stress during early development limits maize (Zea mays L.) production in temperate zones. Low temperatures restrict root growth and reprogram gene expression. Here, we provide a systematic transcriptomic landscape of maize primary roots, their tissues, and cell types in response to cold stress. The epidermis exhibited a unique transcriptomic cold response, and genes involved in root hair formation were dynamically regulated in this cell type by cold. Consequently, activation of genes involved in root hair tip growth contributed to root hair recovery under moderate cold conditions. The maize root hair defective mutants roothair defective 5 (rth5) and roothair defective 6 (rth6) displayed enhanced cold tolerance with respect to primary root elongation. Furthermore, dehydration response element-binding protein 2.1 (dreb2.1) was the only member of the dreb subfamily of AP2/EREB transcription factor genes upregulated in primary root tissues and cell types but exclusively downregulated in root hairs upon cold stress. Plants overexpressing dreb2.1 significantly suppressed root hair elongation after moderate cold stress. Finally, the expression of rth3 was regulated by dreb2.1 under cold conditions, while rth6 transcription was regulated by dreb2.1 irrespective of the temperature regime. We demonstrated that dreb2.1 negatively regulates root hair plasticity at low temperatures by coordinating the expression of root hair defective genes in maize."
39196449,drought response,"Genetic, molecular and physiological crosstalk during drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays): pathways to resilient agriculture.","This review comprehensively elucidates maize drought tolerance mechanisms, vital for global food security. It highlights genetic networks, key genes, CRISPR-Cas applications, and physiological responses, guiding resilient variety development. Maize, a globally significant crop, confronts the pervasive challenge of drought stress, impacting its growth and yield significantly. Drought, an important abiotic stress, triggers a spectrum of alterations encompassing maize's morphological, biochemical, and physiological dimensions. Unraveling and understanding these mechanisms assumes paramount importance for ensuring global food security. Approaches like developing drought-tolerant varieties and harnessing genomic and molecular applications emerge as effective measures to mitigate the negative effects of drought. The multifaceted nature of drought tolerance in maize has been unfolded through complex genetic networks. Additionally, quantitative trait loci mapping and genome-wide association studies pinpoint key genes associated with drought tolerance, influencing morphophysiological traits and yield. Furthermore, transcription factors like ZmHsf28, ZmNAC20, and ZmNF-YA1 play pivotal roles in drought response through hormone signaling, stomatal regulation, and gene expression. Genes, such as ZmSAG39, ZmRAFS, and ZmBSK1, have been reported to be pivotal in enhancing drought tolerance through diverse mechanisms. Integration of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, targeting genes like gl2 and ZmHDT103, emerges as crucial for precise genetic enhancement, highlighting its role in safeguarding global food security amid pervasive drought challenges. Thus, decoding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of drought tolerance in maize sheds light on its resilience and paves the way for cultivating robust and climate-smart varieties, thus safeguarding global food security amid climate challenges. This comprehensive review covers quantitative trait loci mapping, genome-wide association studies, key genes and functions, CRISPR-Cas applications, transcription factors, physiological responses, signaling pathways, offering a nuanced understanding of intricate mechanisms involved in maize drought tolerance."
39214652,root morphology,Root Anatomical Imaging and Phenotyping in Maize.,"Root anatomy plays a crucial role in regulating essential processes such as the absorption and movement of water and nutrients in plants. Root anatomy also impacts the energy costs of building and sustaining root tissues, tissue mechanics, and interactions with other organisms. Although several studies in maize have confirmed the functional utility of numerous root anatomical traits, such as that of cortical cell size and number for stress adaptation, there have been significant obstacles in measuring and analyzing root anatomical characteristics. This has resulted in gaps in our understanding of the genetic control and range of phenotypic variations among different cultivars, and how this diversity relates to overall fitness. Here, we review root anatomical phenotypes in maize and their function in stress adaptation, and briefly discuss phenotyping methods available for root anatomy. We further introduce a simple and accessible phenotyping approach that enables a comprehensive investigation of maize root anatomy. Detailed characterization of root traits and the implementation of robust methods for root anatomical phenotyping could have wide-ranging benefits across various areas of plant science, from fundamental research to enhancing crop breeding efforts."
39217146,response to maize rough dwarf virus,ZmGDIα-hel counters the RBSDV-induced reduction of active gibberellins to alleviate maize rough dwarf virus disease,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) threatens maize production globally. The P7-1 effector of the rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) targets maize Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha (ZmGDIα) to cause MRDD. However, P7-1 has difficulty recruiting a ZmGDIα variant with an alternative helitron-derived exon 10 (ZmGDIα-hel), resulting in recessive resistance. Here, we demonstrate that P7-1 can recruit another maize protein, gibberellin 2-oxidase 13 (ZmGA2ox7.3), which also exhibits tighter binding affinity for ZmGDIα than ZmGDIα-hel. The oligomerization of ZmGA2ox7.3 is vital for its function in converting bioactive gibberellins into inactive forms. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of ZmGA2ox7.3 oligomers increases when forming hetero-oligomers with P7-1/ZmGDIα, but decreases when ZmGDIα-hel replaces ZmGDIα. Viral infection significantly promotes ZmGA2ox7.3 expression and oligomerization in ZmGDIα-containing susceptible maize, resulting in reduced bioactive GA1/GA4 levels. This causes an auxin/cytokinin imbalance and ultimately manifests as MRDD syndrome. Conversely, in resistant maize, ZmGDIα-hel counters these virus-induced changes, thereby mitigating MRDD severity."
39219030,drought response,ZmCRK1 negatively regulates maize's response to drought stress by phosphorylating plasma membrane H+-ATPase ZmMHA2.,"Drought severely affects crop growth and yields. Stomatal regulation plays an important role in plant response to drought stress. Light-activated plasma membrane-localized proton ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) mainly promoted the stomatal opening. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a dominant role in the stomatal closure during drought stress. It is not clear how PM H+-ATPase is involved in the regulation of ABA-induced stomatal closure. We found that a CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE RELATED KINASE 1 (ZmCRK1), and its mutant zmcrk1 exhibited slow water loss in detached leaves, high-survival rate after drought stress, and sensitivity to stomatal closure induced by ABA. The ZmCRK1 overexpression lines are opposite. ZmCRK1 interacted with the maize PM H+-ATPase ZmMHA2. ZmCRK1 phosphorylated ZmMHA2 at the Ser-901 and inhibited its proton pump activity. ZmCRK1 overexpression lines and zmmha2 mutants had low H+-ATPase activity, resulting in impaired ABA-induced H+ efflux. Taken together, our study indicates that ZmCRK1 negatively regulates maize drought stress response by inhibiting the activity of ZmMHA2. Reducing the expression level of ZmCRK1 has the potential to reduce yield losses under water deficiency."
39229826,carotenoid content,"Influence of exogenous 24-epibrassinolide on improving carotenoid content, antioxidant capacity and gene expression in germinated maize seeds.","Background: Carotenoids have various physiological functions, such as immune regulation and cancer prevention. Germination could further improve the content of carotenoids in maize seeds. In this study, yellow maize seeds (Suyu 29) were soaked and germinated with different concentrations of 24-epibrassinolide. The changes of germination percentage, sprout length, bioactive components, antioxidant capacity and carotenoid content of the maize seeds were analyzed. Additionally, the relative expression of key genes in the carotenoid synthesis pathway was investigated. 

Results: The results showed that the sprout length, germination percentage, soluble protein, free amino acids, proline, endogenous abscisic acid, vitamin C, total phenolics and carotenoids displayed a significant increasing trend compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The activity of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase increased by 55.1% and 58.5% versus the control group, and the antioxidant capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and ferric reducing antioxidant power was 19.8%, 13.4% and 44.1% higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of genes was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). Under the treatment of 0.1 mg L-1 of 24-epibrassinolide, carotenoid content reached the highest value. The carotenoids showed a positive correspondence with antioxidant enzyme activity, antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content (P < 0.05). 

Conclusion: This study showed that 0.1 mg L-1 of exogenous 24-epibrassinolide promoted the accumulation of carotenoids and improved the antioxidant capacity and the quality of germinated maize seeds. It could provide a method for the development of germinated maize products enriched in carotenoids. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry."
39235999,response to heavy metals,Selective synergistic effects of oxalic acid and salicylic acid in enhancing amino acid levels and alleviating lead stress in Zea mays L.,"Lead is one of the major environmental pollutants which is highly toxic to plants and living beings. The current investigation thoroughly evaluated the synergistic effects of oxalic acid (OA) and salicylic acid (SA) on Zea mays L. plants subjected to varying durations (15, 30, 30, and 45 days) of lead (Pb) stress. Besides, the effects of oxalic acid (OA) combined with salicylic acid (SA) for different amino acids at various periods of Pb stress were also investigated on Zea mays L. The soil was treated with lead nitrate Pb (NO3)2 (0.5 mM) to induce Pb stress while the stressed plants were further treated using oxalic acid (25 mg/L), salicylic acid (25 mg/L), and their combination OA + SA (25 mg/L each). Measurements of protein content, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, GSH content, and Pb concentration in maize leaves were done during this study. MDA levels increased by 71% under Pb stress, while protein content decreased by 56%, GSH content by 35%, and CAT activity by 46%. After treatment with SA, OA, and OA+SA, there was a significant reversal of these damages, with the OA+SA combination showing the highest improvement. Specifically, OA+SA treatment led to a 45% increase in protein content and a 39% reduction in MDA levels compared to Pb treatment alone. Moreover, amino acid concentrations increased by 68% under the Pb+OA+SA treatment, reflecting the most significant recovery (p < 0.0001)."
39246817,phosphorus use efficiency,Multi-locus genome-wide association study for phosphorus use efficiency in a tropical maize germplasm.,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for maize (Zea mays L.) growth and development. Therefore, generating cultivars with upgraded P use efficiency (PUE) represents one of the main strategies to reduce the global agriculture dependence on phosphate fertilizers. In this work, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to detect quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) and potential PUE-related candidate genes and associated traits in greenhouse and field trials under contrasting P conditions. The PUE and other agronomy traits of 132 maize inbred lines were assessed in low and normal P supply through the greenhouse and field experiments and Multi-locus GWAS was used to map the associated QTNs. Wide genetic variability was observed among the maize inbred lines under low and normal P supply. In addition, we confirm the complex and quantitative nature of PUE. A total of 306 QTNs were associated with the 24 traits evaluated using different multi-locus GWAS methods. A total of 186 potential candidate genes were identified, mainly involved with transcription regulator, transporter, and transference activity. Further studies are still needed to elucidate the functions and relevance of these genes regarding PUE. Nevertheless, pyramiding the favorable alleles pinpointed in the present study can be considered an efficient strategy for molecular improvement to increase maize PUE."
39259496,leaf angle; oil content  kernel,Trait association and prediction through integrative k-mer analysis.,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been widely used to explore genetic controls of phenotypic traits. Alternatively, GWAS can use counts of substrings of length k from longer sequencing reads, k-mers, as genotyping data. Using maize cob and kernel color traits, we demonstrated that k-mer GWAS can effectively identify associated k-mers. Co-expression analysis of kernel color k-mers and genes directly found k-mers from known causal genes. Analyzing complex traits of kernel oil and leaf angle resulted in k-mers from both known and candidate genes. A gene encoding a MADS transcription factor was functionally validated by showing that ectopic expression of the gene led to less upright leaves. Evolution analysis revealed most k-mers positively correlated with kernel oil were strongly selected against in maize populations, while most k-mers for upright leaf angle were positively selected. In addition, genomic prediction of kernel oil, leaf angle, and flowering time using k-mer data resulted in a similarly high prediction accuracy to the standard SNP-based method. Collectively, we showed k-mer GWAS is a powerful approach for identifying trait-associated genetic elements. Further, our results demonstrated the bridging role of k-mers for data integration and functional gene discovery."
39265409,phenolic content; Anthocyanin content; fatty acid content,Blue maize with pigmented germ: Phytochemical compounds and tortilla color.,"Blue maize is used in the production of various traditional foods, and its phytochemical composition has been claimed to possess health benefits. In this study, two blue maize hybrids with pigmented germ grown in five environments were studied under the hypothesis that the germ could have a different anthocyanin profile from that of anthocyanins synthesized in the aleurone layer, and that those in the germ could increase the total anthocyanin content in the whole grain. The percentage of pigmented germ, total anthocyanin content (TA) and total soluble phenols in the germ, whole grain and tortilla were evaluated to determine how tortilla color is modified. For the first time, the anthocyanin and fatty acid profiles of pigmented germ were determined. In the anthocyanin profile, anthocyanins derived from peonidin stood out, making 50.7 %. The most abundant fatty acid was linoleic acid (40.6 %). Whole kernel TA content increased when the maize had a higher percentage of pigmented germ, with minimal changes when grain was transformed to tortilla, resulting in darker tortillas. The large variation in TA among environments highlights the importance of identifying the environments that most favor anthocyanin synthesis. 
Highlights:
    •    Blue maize hybrids had pigmented germ in 3.5 to 47.5 % of the kernels. 
    •    Eleven types of anthocyanins were found in blue maize germ. 
    •    Anthocyanin content remained as high as 86.6 % after processing grain into tortilla. 
    •    The presence of anthocyanins in the germ did not alter the fatty acid profile."
39273296,osmotic adjustment; drought response,An Integrated Framework for Drought Stress in Plants,"With global warming, drought stress is becoming increasingly severe, causing serious impacts on crop yield and quality. In order to survive under adverse conditions such as drought stress, plants have evolved a certain mechanism to cope. The tolerance to drought stress is mainly improved through the synergistic effect of regulatory pathways, such as transcription factors, phytohormone, stomatal movement, osmotic substances, sRNA, and antioxidant systems. This study summarizes the research progress on plant drought resistance, in order to provide a reference for improving plant drought resistance and cultivating drought-resistant varieties through genetic engineering technology."
39276212,response to Gibberella ear rot,Genome-wide association study and molecular marker development for susceptibility to Gibberella ear rot in maize.,"Sixty-nine quantitative trait nucleotides conferring maize resistance to Gibberella ear rot were detected, including eighteen novel loci. Four candidate genes were predicted, and four kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers were developed. Maize Gibberella ear rot (GER), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most devastating diseases in maize-growing regions worldwide. Enhancing maize cultivar resistance to this disease requires a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of resistance to GER. In this study, 334 maize inbred lines were phenotyped for GER resistance in five environments and genotyped using the Affymetrix CGMB56K SNP Array, and a genome-wide association study of resistance to GER was performed using a 3V multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model. A total of 69 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) conferring resistance to GER were detected, and all of them explained individually less than 10% of the phenotypic variation, suggesting that resistance to GER is controlled by multiple minor-effect genetic loci. A total of 348 genes located around the 200-kb genomic region of these 69 QTNs were identified, and four of them (Zm00001d029648, Zm00001d031449, Zm00001d006397, and Zm00001d053145) were considered candidate genes conferring susceptibility to GER based on gene expression patterns. Moreover, four kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers were developed based on the non-synonymous variation of these four candidate genes and validated in two genetic populations. This study provides useful genetic resources for improving resistance to GER in maize."
39289494,mycorrhizal infection; drought response,Tissue-specific accumulation of PIP aquaporins of a particular heteromeric composition is part of the maize response to mycorrhiza and drought,"The systemic coordination of accumulation of plasma membrane aquaporins (PIP) was investigated in this study in relation to mycorrhized maize response to a rapid development of severe drought followed by rewatering. In non-mycorrhizal roots, drought led to a drop in PIP abundance, followed by a transient increase under rewatering, whereas leaves showed an opposite pattern. In contrast, mycorrhiza contributed to maintenance of high and stable levels of PIPs in both plant organs after an initial increase, prolonged over the irrigation period. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis resolved up to 13 aquaporin complexes with highly reproducible pl positions across leaf and root samples, symbiotic and non-symbiotic, stressed or not. Mass spectrometry recognized in leaves and roots a different ratio of PIP1 and PIP2 subunits within 2D spots that accumulated the most. Regardless of symbiotic status, drought regulation of aquaporins in roots was manifested as the prevalence of complexes that comprise almost exclusively PIP2 monomers. In contrast, the leaf response involved enrichment in PIP1s. PIP1s are thought to enhance water transport, facilitate CO2 diffusion but also affect stomatal movements. These features, together with elevated aquaporin levels, might explain a stress tolerance mechanism observed in mycorrhizal plants, resulting in faster recovery of stomatal water conductance and CO2 assimilation rate after drought."
39292640,root development; response to phosphorus,"Regulation of maize root growth by local phosphorus availability, sucrose metabolism, and partitioning.","Background and aims: Understanding how maize roots proliferate in phosphorus (P)-rich soil patches is critical for improving nutrient acquisition and crop productivity. This study explores the mechanisms of root adaptation to heterogeneous P availability, focusing on sucrose metabolism and the role of local P signals. 

Methods: A split-root system with chambers of differing Pi concentrations (0 and 500 μM) was used to examine maize root responses. Various physiological and biochemical parameters, including root growth, sucrose partitioning, enzyme activities, and gene expression, were measured to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. 

Key results: Root proliferation, particularly of second-order lateral roots, was markedly enhanced in P-rich patches. Sucrose was preferentially allocated to the Pi-supplied side, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. Sucrose content in these roots decreased, indicating active metabolism. Higher activities of cell-wall invertase and sucrose synthase were observed in the Pi-supplied roots, supporting enhanced carbohydrate utilization. 

Conclusions: Local P availability triggers significant adjustments in sucrose metabolism and allocation, enhancing the sink capacity of maize roots in P-rich patches. These changes facilitate efficient lateral root proliferation and Pi utilization, highlighting the critical role of local P signals in nutrient acquisition strategies. This research provides deeper insights into the adaptive responses of maize to heterogeneous P environments, offering potential strategies for improving crop nutrient efficiency."
39294608,response to Striga,Genome-wide association analysis of grain yield and Striga hermonthica and S. asiatica resistance in tropical and sub-tropical maize populations.,"Background: Genetic improvement for Striga hermonthica (Sh) and S. asiatica (Sa) resistance is the most economical and effective control method to enhance the productivity of maize and other major cereal crops. Hence, identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with Striga resistance and economic traits will guide the pace and precision of resistance breeding in maize. The objective of this study was to undertake a genome-wide association analysis of grain yield and Sh and Sa resistance among tropical and sub-tropical maize populations to identify putative genetic markers and genes for resistance breeding. 126 maize genotypes were evaluated under controlled environment conditions using artificial infestation of Sh and Sa. The test genotypes were profiled for grain yield (GY), Striga emergence counts at 8 (SEC8) and 10 (SEC10) weeks after planting, and Striga damage rate scores at 8 (SDR8) and 10 (SDR10) weeks after planting. Population structure analysis and genome-wide association mapping were undertaken based on 16,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. 

Results: A linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis in 798,675 marker pairs revealed that 21.52% of pairs were in significant linkage (P < 0.001). Across the chromosomes, the LD between SNPs decayed below a critical level (r2 = 0.1) at a map distance of 0.19 Mbp. The genome-wide association study identified 50 significant loci associated with Sh resistance and 22 significant loci linked to Sa resistance, corresponding to 39 and 19 candidate genes, respectively. 

Conclusion: The study found non-significant QTL associated with dual resistance to the two examined Striga species Some of the detected genes reportedly conditioned insect and pathogen resistance, plant cell development, variable senescence, and pollen fertility. The markers detected in the present study for Sa resistance were reported for the first time. The gene Zm00001eb219710 was pleiotropic, and conditioned GY and SEC10, while Zm00001eb165170 affected SDR8 and SDR10, and Zm00001eb112030 conditioned SDR8 and SDR10 associated with Sh resistance. The candidate genes may facilitate simultaneous selection for Sh and Sa resistance and grain yield in maize after further validation and introgression in breeding pipelines. Overall, we recommend breeding maize specifically for resistance to each Striga species using germplasm adapted to the endemic region of each parasite."
39299901,agrobacterium mediated transformation,Recent Advances in Agrobacterium-Mediated Maize Genetic Transformation Using Immature Embryos and Seedling Leaf Whorl Explants.,"The introduction of maize genetic transformation in the 1990s brought forth a powerful tool for crop improvement and a deeper understanding of plant genetics. Despite decades of genetics research, however, and the promise of CRISPR-mediated gene editing, maize transformation currently faces several challenges, such as genotype dependence and limitations in explant availability. Indeed, although the most commonly used method, immature embryo transformation, has been improved through optimization of tissue culture media composition and selection methods, the approach is only applicable to a limited number of public genotypes, including B104 and Hi II. Recently, genotype-flexible methods have been developed using coexpression cassettes of morphogenic transcription factors (MTFs) Baby boom (Bbm) and Wushel2 (Wus2), which have enabled the successful transformation of many previously recalcitrant maize lines. This MTF-based transformation method has also allowed for the use of alternate explants, such as seedling leaf whorl, whose production is cost-effective and requires only minimum controlled growth space. In this review, we summarize recent advances in Agrobacterium-mediated maize transformation methods that use immature embryos or seedling leaf whorls as starting material."
39299902,agrobacterium mediated transformation,A Rapid Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation Method Using Maize B104 Immature Embryos.,"Maize genetic transformation is a critical tool for functional genomics and crop improvement. Many laboratories, however, continue to face multiple challenges in attempting to achieve routine genetic transformation of maize inbred genotypes. Here, we describe a rapid and robust maize B104 transformation method using immature embryos as explants. This method uses an Agrobacterium ternary vector system, which includes a conventional T-DNA binary vector (pCBL101-RUBY) and a compatible ternary helper plasmid (pKL2299) that carries extra copies of essential virulence genes. The T-DNA binary vector carries the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NptII) gene for selection and a betalain biosynthesis marker, RUBY, for visual screening. We provide step-by-step instructions for immature embryo explant preparation, Agrobacterium infection, tissue culture procedures, and greenhouse care for acclimatization of regenerated plantlets."
39299903,agrobacterium mediated transformation,Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation of Tropical Maize Using Seedling Leaf Whorl Explants.,"Conventional maize transformation has largely relied on immature embryos as explants, and is thus often hampered by the limited access to high-quality immature embryos year-round. Here, we present a detailed protocol using seedling leaf whorls as alternative explants for tropical maize inbred transformation. This approach involves the use of a cassette that drives the expression of the morphogenic transcription factors (MTFs) Baby boom (Bbm) and Wuschel2 (Wus2), which have been shown to greatly enhance transformation efficiency. We outline here the steps required for the preparation of seedling leaf whorl explants and subsequent Agrobacterium infection, and describe the tissue culture regimen that results in transgenic plant regeneration. Because constitutive expression of Bbm and Wus2 prevents normal plant regeneration and the production of fertile plants, the cassette containing these genes must be excised. As such, we include the steps for the Cre/loxP-mediated excision of the MTF gene cassette. The protocol outlines a year-round, more affordable, and efficient approach for carrying out maize transformation for crop improvement."
39299955,ear morphology; kernel row number,Determination of single or paired-kernel-rows is controlled by two quantitative loci during maize domestication.,"qPEDS1, a major quantitative trait locus that determines kernel row number during domestication, harbors the proposed causal gene Zm00001d033675, which may affect jasmonic acid biosynthesis and determine the fate of spikelets. Maize domestication has achieved the production of maize with enlarged ears, enhancing grain productivity dramatically. Kernel row number (KRN), an important yield-related trait, has increased from two rows in teosinte to at least eight rows in modern maize. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. To understand KRN domestication, we developed a teosinte-maize BC2F7 population by introgressing teosinte into a maize background. We identified one line, Teosinte ear rank1 (Ter1), with only 5-7 kernel rows which is fewer than those in almost all maize inbred lines. We detected two quantitative trait loci underlying Ter1 and fine-mapped the major one to a 300-kb physical interval. Two candidate genes, Zm674 and Zm675, were identified from 26 maize reference genomes and teosinte bacterial artificial chromosome sequences. Finally, we proposed that Ter1 affects jasmonic acid biosynthesis in the developing ear to determine KRN by the fate of spikelets. This study provides novel insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying KRN domestication and candidates for de novo wild teosinte domestication."
39302972,kernel row number,KRN5b regulates maize kernel row number through mediating phosphoinositol signalling.,"Kernel row number (KRN) is a major yield related trait for maize (Zea mays L.) and is also a major goal of breeders, as it can increase the number of kernels per plant. Thus, identifying new genetic factors involving in KRN formation may accelerate improving yield-related traits genetically. We herein describe a new kernel number-related gene (KRN5b) identified from KRN QTL qKRN5b and encoding an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase). KRN5b has phosphatase activity towards PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in vitro. Knocking out KRN5b caused accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3, resulting in disordered kernel rows and a decrease in the number of kernels and tassel branches. The introgression of the allele with higher expression abundance into different inbred lines could increase the ear weight of the inbred lines and the corresponding hybrids by 10.1%-12.2% via increasing KRN, with no adverse effects on other agronomic traits. Further analyses showed that KRN5b regulates inflorescence development through affecting the synthesis and distribution of hormones. Together, KRN5b contributes to spikelet pair meristem development through inositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositols, making it a selecting target for yield improvement."
39311423,response to maize chlorotic mottle virus,N<sup>6</sup>-Methyladenosine RNA Modification Regulates Maize Resistance to Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus Infection,"Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) is one of the main viruses causing significant losses in maize. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification has been proven to play important regulatory roles in plant development and stress response. In this study, we found that MCMV infection significantly up-regulated the m6A level in maize, and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed to investigate the distribution of m6A modified peaks and gene expression patterns in MCMV-infected maize plants. The results showed that 1325 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and 47 differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs) were identified and analyzed. Moreover, the results of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays showed that ZmECT18 and ZmGST31 were required for MCMV infection, while silencing of ZmMTC, ZmSCI1 or ZmTIP1 significantly promoted MCMV infection in maize. Our findings provided novel insights into the regulatory roles of m6A modification in maize response to MCMV infection."
39321938,stalk quality,High-throughput prediction of stalk cellulose and hemicellulose content in maize using machine learning and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.,"Cellulose and hemicellulose are key cross-linked carbohydrates affecting bioethanol production in maize stalks. Traditional wet chemical methods for their detection are labor-intensive, highlighting the need for high-throughput techniques. This study used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms on 200 large-scale maize germplasms to develop robust predictive models for stalk cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose content. We identified several peak height features correlated with three contents, used them as input data for model building. Four ML algorithms demonstrated higher predictive accuracy, achieving coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.83 to 0.97. Notably, the Categorical Boosting algorithm yielded optimal models with coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.91 for the training set and over 0.81 for the test set. The approach combined FTIR spectroscopy with ML algorithms offers a precise and high-throughput tool for predicting stalk cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose contents, benefiting maize genetic breeding for bioenergy and biofuels. 
Highlights: 
    •   Large-scale maize germplasms are suitable for a stable and consistent FTIR assay. 
    •   Significantly related peak heights from FTIR spectra were identified for model input. 
    •   Machine learning algorithms combined FTIR data largely improved predictive accuracy. 
    •   CatBoost algorithm offered highest accuracy for predicting hemicellulose content."
39325221,grain moisture,QTL mapping and omics analysis to identify genes controlling kernel dehydration in maize.,"This study mapped and screened three candidate genes related to kernel dehydration in maize. The slow development rate of maize kernels during later stages leads to high kernel moisture content at harvest, posing a challenge for mechanized maize harvesting in China. This study utilized a recombinant inbred line population derived from Zheng 58 (slow dehydration) and PH6WC (fast dehydration) as parents. After four years of trait investigation and analysis, 25 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with kernel dehydration rate and moisture content were identified, with six QTLs showing a significant contribution value exceeding 10% in the phenotype. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the QTLs identified in this study and those from previous research on maize kernel moisture content and dehydration rate, followed by screening through the omics analysis of the parental lines. Three candidate genes related to kernel dehydration rate were identified, primarily involving carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism processes (Zm00001d014030 and Zm00001d006476), and stimulus resistance (Zm00001d040113). These findings provide valuable insights to assist and guide future breeding efforts for mechanical harvesting of maize."
39327540,response to heavy metals,Transcriptomics Combined with Physiology and Metabolomics Reveals the Mechanism of Tolerance to Lead Toxicity in Maize Seedling.,"Lead (Pb) exposure can induce molecular changes in plants, disrupt metabolites, and impact plant growth. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the molecular mechanisms involved in Pb tolerance in plants to evaluate the long-term environmental consequences of Pb exposure. This research focused on maize as the test subject to study variations in biomass, root traits, genes, and metabolites under hydroponic conditions under Pb conditions. The findings indicate that high Pb stress significantly disrupts plant growth and development, leading to a reduction in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activities by 17.12, 5.78, and 19.38%, respectively. Conversely, Pb stress led to increase malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, ultimately impacting the growth of maize. The non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified 393 metabolites categorized into 12 groups, primarily consisting of organic acids and derivatives, organ heterocyclic compounds, lipids and lipid-like molecules and benzenoids. Further analysis indicated that Pb stress induced an accumulation of 174 metabolites mainly enriched in seven metabolic pathways, for example phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1933 shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 1356 upregulated and 577 downregulated genes across all Pb treatments. Additionally, an integrated analysis identified several DEGs and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs), including peroxidase, alpha-trehalose, and D-glucose 6-phosphate, which were linked to cell wall biosynthesis. These findings imply the significance of this pathway in Pb detoxification. This comprehensive investigation, employing multiple methodologies, provides a detailed molecular-level insight into maize's response to Pb stress."
39343093,kernel weight,Natural variation of CT2 affects the embryo/kernel weight ratio in maize.,"Embryo size is a critical trait determining not only grain yield but also the nutrition of the maize kernel. Up to present, only a few genes have been characterized affecting the maize embryo/kernel ratio. Here, we identify 63 genes significantly associated with maize embryo/kernel weight ratio using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The peak GWAS signal shows that the natural variation in Zea mays COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2), encoding the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit, is significantly associated with the Embryo/Kernel Weight Ratio (EKWR), Further analyses show that a missense mutation of CT2 decreases its enzyme activity and associates with EKWR. The function of CT2 on affecting embryo/kernel weight ratio is further validated by characterization of two ct2 mutants, for which EKWR is significantly decreased. Subsequently, the key downstream genes of CT2 are identified by combining the differential expression analysis (DEG) of the ct2 mutant and quantitative trait transcript analysis in the GWAS population. In addition, the allele frequency spectrum shows that CT2 was under selective pressure during maize domestication. This study provides important genetic insights into the natural variation of maize embryo/kernel weight ratio, which could be applied in future maize breeding programs to improve grain yield and nutritional content."
39356644,response to cold stress; mycorrhizal infection,Potential Regulatory Effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi on Lipid Metabolism of Maize in Response to Low-Temperature Stress,"The specific mechanisms underlying membrane lipid remodeling and changes in gene expression induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in low-temperature-stressed plants are still unclear. In this study, physiological, transcriptomic, and lipidomic analyses were used to elucidate the physiological mechanisms by which AMF can enhance the adaptation of maize plants to low-temperature stress. The results showed that the relative electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content of maize leaves were decreased after the inoculation with AMF, indicating that AMF reduced the peroxidation of membrane lipids and maintained the fluidity of the cell membrane. Transcriptomic analysis showed the presence of 702 differentially expressed genes induced by AMF in maize plants exposed to low-temperature stress. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis revealed changes in 10 lipid classes in AMF-inoculated maize plants compared with their noninoculated counterparts under low-temperature stress conditions. Lipid remodeling is an important strategy that arbuscular mycorrhizal plants adopt to cope with low-temperature stress."
39358657,drought response; response to aluminum,Ellagic acid alleviates aluminum and/or drought stress through morpho-physiochemical adjustments and stress-related gene expression in Zea mays L,"This study investigates the potential of ellagic acid (EA) to mitigate the effects of drought and aluminum (Al3+) stresses in maize by examining various morpho-physiochemical parameters and gene expressions. Maize (Zea mays L.) serves as a crucial global food source, but its growth and productivity are significantly hindered by drought and aluminum (Al3+) stresses, which lead to impaired root development, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), diminished photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced water and mineral absorption. Recently, ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic compound with potent antioxidant properties, has been identified for its role in regulating plant growth and enhancing stress tolerance mechanisms. However, the specific mechanisms through which EA contributes to Al3+ and/or drought tolerance in plants remain largely unknown. The present study was conducted to examine the defensive role of EA (100 μg/mL) in some morpho-physiochemical parameters and the expression profiles of some stress-related genes (ZmCPK22, ZmXTH1, ZmHIPP4, ZmSGR, ZmpsbA, ZmAPX1, and ZmGST1) in drought (polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000), − 0.6 MPa) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3, 60 μM) stressed Zea mays Ada 523 grown in nutrient solution. Our results indicated that drought and aluminum chloride stresses affected root length, shoot height, H2O2 content, chlorophyll content (SPAD), electrolyte leakage (EL), and relative water content (RWC) of maize with several significant (P < 0.05) shifts up and down. Conversely, EA (100 μg/mL) treatment had a mitigating effect on these parameters. Moreover, EA also mitigated the antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)), and regulated the expressions of aforementioned genes. These findings determined that EA treatment could efficiently improve the gene expressions and morpho-physiochemical parameters under drought and/or Al3+ stresses, thereby increasing the seedlings’ adaptability to these stresses."
39359623,agrobacterium mediated transformation,A simple and efficient method for betalain quantification in RUBY-expressing plant samples.,"The RUBY reporter system has demonstrated great potential as a visible marker to monitor gene expression in both transiently and stably transformed plant tissues. Ectopic expression of the RUBY reporter leads to bright red pigmentation in plant tissues that do not naturally accumulate betalain. Unlike traditional visual markers such as β-glucuronidase (GUS), luciferase (LUC), and various fluorescent proteins, the RUBY reporter system does not require sample sacrifice or special equipment for visualizing the gene expression. However, a robust quantitative analysis method for betalain content has been lacking, limiting accurate comparative analyses. In this work, we present a simple and rapid protocol for quantitative evaluation of RUBY expression in transgenic plant tissues. Using this method, we demonstrate that differential RUBY expression can be quantified in transiently transformed leaf tissues, such as agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, and in stable transgenic maize tissues, including seeds, leaves, and roots. We found that grinding fresh tissues with a hand grinder and plastic pestle, without the use of liquid nitrogen, is an effective method for rapid betalain extraction. Betalain contents estimated by spectrophotometric and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses were highly consistent, validating that our rapid betalain extraction and quantification method is suitable for comparative analysis. In addition, betalain content was strongly correlated with RUBY expression level in agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves, suggesting that our method can be useful for monitoring transient transformation efficiency in plants. Using our rapid protocol, we quantified varying levels of betalain pigment in N. benthamiana leaves, ranging from 110 to 1066 mg/kg of tissue, and in maize samples, ranging from 15.3 to 1028.7 mg/kg of tissue. This method is expected to streamline comparative studies in plants, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of various promoters, enhancers, or other regulatory elements used in transgenic constructs."
39360383,response to Sporisorium reilianum,A maize WAK-SnRK1α2-WRKY module regulates nutrient availability to defend against head smut disease.,"Obligate biotrophs depend on living hosts for nutrient acquisition to complete their lifecycle, yet the mechanisms by which hosts restrict nutrient availability to pathogens remain largely unknown. The fungal pathogen Sporisorium reilianum infects maize seedlings and causes head smut disease in inflorescences at maturity, while a cell wall-associated kinase, ZmWAK, provides quantitative resistance against it. Here, we demonstrate that S. reilianum can rapidly activate ZmWAK kinase activity, which is sustained by the 407th Threonine residue in the juxtamembrane domain, enabling it to interact with and phosphorylate ZmSnRK1α2, a conserved sucrose non-fermenting-related kinase α subunit. The activated ZmSnRK1α2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and destabilizes the transcription factor ZmWRKY53. The reduced ZmWRKY53 abundance leads to the downregulation of genes involved in transmembrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism, resulting in nutrient starvation for S. reilianum in the apoplast. Our study uncovers a WAK-SnRK1α2-WRKY53 signaling module in maize that conveys phosphorylation cascades from the plasma membrane to the nuclei to confer resistance against head-smut in maize, with profound implications for crop management and application."
39360899,disease response,Regulation of maize growth and immunity by ZmSKI3-mediated RNA decay and post-transcriptional gene silencing.,"Disease resistance is often associated with compromised plant growth and yield due to defense-growth tradeoffs. However, key components and mechanisms underlying the defense-growth tradeoffs are rarely explored in maize. In this study, we find that ZmSKI3, a putative subunit of the SUPERKILLER (SKI) complex that mediates the 3'-5' degradation of RNA, regulates both plant development and disease resistance in maize. The Zmski3 mutants showed retarded plant growth and constitutively activated defense responses, while the ZmSKI3 overexpression lines are more susceptible to Curvularia lunata and Bipolaris maydis. Consistently, the expression of defense-related genes was generally up-regulated, while expressions of growth-related genes were mostly down-regulated in leaves of the Zmski3-1 mutant compared to that of wild type. In addition, 223 differentially expressed genes that are up-regulated in Zmski3-1 mutant but down-regulated in the ZmSKI3 overexpression line are identified as potential target genes of ZmSKI3. Moreover, small interfering RNAs targeting the transcripts of the defense- and growth-related genes are differentially accumulated, likely to combat the increase of defense-related transcripts but decrease of growth-related transcripts in Zmski3-1 mutant. Taken together, our study indicates that plant growth and immunity could be regulated by both ZmSKI3-mediated RNA decay and post-transcriptional gene silencing in maize."
39361185,response to Asian corn borer,A new Bowman-Birk type protease inhibitor regulated by MeJA pathway in maize exhibits anti-feedant activity against the Ostrinia furnacalis.,"Jasmonic acid (JA), an important plant hormone, plays a crucial role in defending against herbivorous insects. In this study, we have identified a new Bowman-Birk type protease inhibitor (BBTI) protein in maize that is regulated by the JA pathway and exhibits significant antifeedant activity, which is notably induced by exogenous Methyl Jasmonate and Ostrinia furnacalis feeding treatments. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant differences in the BBTI protein among different maize inbred lines, except for the conserved domain. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were constructed and expressed, and combined with bioassays, it was demonstrated that the antifeedant activity of BBTI is determined by protein modifications and conserved domains. Through RT-qPCR detection of BBTI and JA regulatory pathway-related genes' temporal expression in different maize inbred lines, we identified the regulatory mechanism of BBTI synthesis under the JA pathway. This study successfully cloned and identified the MeJA-induced anti-feedant activity gene BBTI and conducted functional validation in different maize inbred lines, providing valuable insights into the response mechanism of insect resistance induced by the plant JA pathway. The increased expression of the anti-feedant activity gene BBTI through exogenous MeJA induction may offer a potential new strategy for mediating plant defense against Lepidoptan insects. 
Key message: 
    1    BBTI was identified as an insect resistance gene up-regulated by MeJA and O. furnacalis feeding 
    2    New evidence for JA pathway regulation of insect resistance is presented. 
    3    The effects of different expression vectors on protein activity were constructed and compared. 
    4    This study provides a new idea for the ecological control O. furnacalis, and MeJA treatment can be used as a potential pest resistance method to induce maize self-resistance."
39361445,plant height,"Maize-Tripsacum-Teosinte allopolyploid (MTP), a novel dwarf mutant inducer tool in maize.","Dwarf plant architecture facilitates dense planting, and increased planting densities boost the maize yield. However, breeding applications of dwarfing materials for maize are currently limited. There is an urgent need remove the obstacles to applying dwarf resources. Here, we innovated a new method to add a novel maize dwarf germplasm through the distant hybridization of Maize-Tripsacum-Teosinte allopolyploid (MTP) with maize. We identified ten independent dwarf families with unique characteristics. Five germplasms in our library were controlled by their respective dwarf genes. However, no allele was controlled by Br2. Subsequently, d024 in the library was successfully fine mapped, revealing its linkage to indel-4 in ZmCYP90D1. The indel-4 polymorphism regulates the expression of ZmCYP90D1 and is controlled by an upstream transcription factor (ZmBES1/BZR1-5). The indel-4 of ZmCYP90D1 allele, which reduces plant height, originated from Tripsacum, a wild variety of maize. However, d024 exhibits sensitivity to brassinosteroids (BRs), with lower castasterone levels in the internodes than that in the wild type. Furthermore, ZmCYP90D1 interacted with ZmFDXs and ZmNAD(P)H to positively regulate the downstream BR synthesis pathway. Additionally, we showed that introgressing the indel-4 of the Tripsacum allele into modern hybrids ensures yield potential and improves the harvest index under high-density conditions. Overall, as we begin to manufacture highly engineered dwarf materials using the MTP, this approach will solve the problems faced by corn dwarfs."
39361664,foliar senescence,Genetic analysis of stay green related traits in maize with major gene plus polygenes mixed model.,"Maize is one of the main food crops in the world, and cultivating high-yield and high-quality maize varieties is of great significance in addressing food security issues. Leaves are crucial photosynthetic organs in maize, and leaf senescence can result in the degradation of chlorophyll. This, in turn, impacts photosynthetic activity and the accumulation of photosynthetic products. Delaying leaf senescence and increasing carbon assimilation can enhance grain yield and biomass production. The stay green of maize is an important trait closely related to yield, feed quality and resistance. Therefore, this study employed multi-generation joint analysis of major genes and a polygene model to investigate the genetic inheritance of stay green-related traits. Four populations (P1, P2, F1 and F2) were obtained by crossing T01 (stay green) × Xin3 (non-stay green) and T01 (stay green) × Mo17 (non-stay green) under two environments. Six stay green-related traits, including visual stay green (VSG), number of green leaves (GLNM), SPAD value of ear leaf at anthesis (SPADS), SPAD value of ear leaf at maturity (SPADM), absolute green leaf area (GLAD), grain yield per plant (GYP), displayed continuous variations with kurtosis and skewness values of absolute value less than 1 and distribution close to normal. They were characterized by typical inheritance of quantitative traits, with these traits demonstrating the transgressive segregation. The correlation analysis among the traits revealed that five stay green traits have a positive impact on yield. VSG, GLNM and SPADM in the two populations were regulated by the two major genes of additive effects plus additive-dominance polygene model with a major gene heritability varying from 89.03 to 95.95% in the F2 generation. GLAD in TMF2 was controlled by two major genes of equal-additive dominance effects with high heritability (93.47%). However, in TXF2, GLAD was regulated by two major genes of additive-dominance interaction effects plus additive-dominance polygene model. These results provide important genetic information for breeding, which could guide the improvement of stay green-related traits. They also lay a foundation for quantitative trait loci mapping of the stay stay-green traits in maize."
39361893,response to heat stress,C4 Grasses Employ Distinct Strategies to Acclimate Rubisco Activase to Heat Stress.,"Rising temperatures due to the current climate crisis will soon have devastating impacts on crop performance and resilience. In particular, CO2 assimilation is dramatically limited at high temperatures. CO2 assimilation is accomplished by rubisco, which is inhibited by the binding of inhibitory sugar phosphates to its active site. Plants therefore utilize the essential chaperone rubisco activase (RCA) to remove these inhibitors and enable continued CO2 fixation. However, RCA does not function at moderately high temperatures (42oC), resulting in impaired rubisco activity and reduced CO2 assimilation. We set out to understand temperature-dependent RCA regulation in four different C4 plants, with a focus on the crop plants maize (two cultivars) and sorghum, as well as the model grass Setaria viridis (setaria) using gas exchange measurements, which confirm that CO2 assimilation is limited by carboxylation in these organisms at high temperatures (42oC). All three species express distinct complements of RCA isoforms and each species alters the isoform and proteoform abundances in response to heat; however, the changes are species-specific. We also examine whether the heat-mediated inactivation of RCA is due to biochemical regulation rather than simple thermal denaturation. We reveal that biochemical regulation affects RCA function differently in different C4 species, and differences are apparent even between different cultivars of the same species. Our results suggest that each grass evolved different strategies to maintain RCA function during stress and we conclude that a successful engineering approach aimed at improving carbon capture in C4 grasses will need to accommodate these individual regulatory mechanisms."
39369351,haploid production,Genomic estimated selection criteria and parental contributions in parent selection increase genetic gain of maternal haploid inducers in maize.,"Parental combinations determined by genomic estimated usefulness and parental contributions of the lines in bridging population can enhance the genetic gain of traits of interest in maternal haploid inducer breeding. Parent selection in crosses aligns well with the quantitative trait performance in the progenies. We herein take advantage of estimated genetic values (EGV) and usefulness criteria (UC) of bi-parental combinations by genomic prediction (GP) to compare the empirical performance of doubled haploid inducer (DHI) progenies of eight elite inducers crosses in a half-diallel. We used parental contribution and discovery of superiors from elite-by-historical bridging populations to enhance genetic gain for long-term selection. In this empirical study, the narrow-sense heritabilities of four traits of interest (Days to flowering, DTF; haploid induction rate, HIR; plant height, PHT; Total primary branch length, PBL) in DHI population were 0.81, 0.71, 0.45 and 0.46, respectively. The genomic estimated EGV_Mid/Mean and EGV/UC_Inferior was significantly correlated with the sample mean of progenies and inferiors in four traits in the breeding and bridging population. EGV/UC_Superior were significantly correlated with the mean of superiors in DTF, PHT, and PBL in breeding and bridging populations. The genomic estimated parent contributions in DH progenies of bridging populations enabled discovery of favorable genome region from historical inducers to improve the genetic gain of HIR for long-term selection."
39387497,cuticular lipids,Integrative multi-omic analysis identifies genes associated with cuticular wax biogenesis in adult maize leaves,"Studying the genetic basis of leaf wax composition and its correlation with leaf cuticular conductance (gc) is crucial for improving crop water-use efficiency. The leaf cuticle, which comprises a cutin matrix and various waxes, functions as an extracellular hydrophobic layer, protecting against water loss upon stomatal closure. To address the limited understanding of genes associated with the natural variation of leaf cuticular waxes and their connection to gc, we conducted statistical genetic analyses using leaf transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological data sets collected from a maize (Zea mays L.) panel of ∼300 inbred lines. Through a random forest analysis with 60 cuticular wax traits, it was shown that high molecular weight wax esters play an important role in predicting gc. Integrating results from genome-wide and transcriptome-wide studies (GWAS and TWAS) via a Fisher’s combined test revealed 231 candidate genes detected by all three association tests. Among these, 11 genes exhibit known or predicted roles in cuticle-related processes. Throughout the genome, multiple hotspots consisting of GWAS signals for several traits from one or more wax classes were discovered, identifying four additional plausible candidate genes and providing insights into the genetic basis of correlated wax traits. Establishing a partially shared genetic architecture, we identified 35 genes for both gc and at least one wax trait, with four considered plausible candidates. Our study uncovered the genetic control of maize leaf waxes, establishing a link between wax composition and gc, with implications for potentially breeding more water-use efficient maize. 

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We exploited natural variation in the abundance of maize leaf cuticular waxes to identify genetic determinants of wax composition and its relationship to cuticle function as a barrier against water loss. We identified a set of strongly supported candidate genes with plausible functions in cuticular wax biosynthesis or deposition and added to the evidence for wax esters as the most important wax for water barrier function, offering new tools for modification of cuticle-dependent traits."
39389460,phosphorus use efficiency; response to low phosphorus; phosphorus uptake; response to phosphorus,"Phosphorus acquisition, translocation, and redistribution in maize.","Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for crop growth, making it important for maintaining food security as the global population continues to increase. Plants acquire P primarily via the uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in soil through their roots. Pi, which is usually sequestered in soils, is not easily absorbed by plants and represses plant growth. Plants have developed a series of mechanisms to cope with P deficiency. Moreover, P fertilizer applications are critical for maximizing crop yield. Maize is a major cereal crop cultivated worldwide. Increasing its P-use efficiency is important for optimizing maize production. Over the past two decades, considerable progresses have been achieved in research aimed at adapting maize varieties to changes in environmental P supply. Here, we present an overview of the morphological, physiological, and molecular mechanisms involved in P acquisition, translocation, and redistribution in maize, and combine the advances in Arabidopsis and rice, to better elucidate the progress of P nutrition. Additionally, we summarize the correlation between P and abiotic stress responses. Clarifying the mechanisms relevant to improving P absorption and use in maize can guide future research on sustainable agriculture."
39395686,response to nitrogen,Time-course transcriptomic analysis reveals transcription factors involved in modulating nitrogen sensibility in maize.,"Nitrogen (N) serves both as a vital macronutrient and a signaling molecule for plants. Unveiling key regulators involved in N metabolism helps dissect the mechanisms underlying N metabolism, which is essential for developing maize with high N use efficiency. Two maize lines, B73 and Ki11, show differential chlorate and low-N tolerance. Time-course transcriptomic analysis reveals that the expression of NUGs in B73 and Ki11 have distinct responsive patterns to nitrate variation. By the coexpression networks, significant differences in the number of N response modules and regulatory networks of transcription factors (TFs) are revealed between B73 and Ki11. There are 23 unique TFs in B73 and 41 unique TFs in Ki11. MADS26 is a unique TF in the B73 N response network, with different expression level and N response pattern in B73 and Ki11. Overexpression of MADS26 enhances the sensitivity to chlorate and the utilization of nitrate in maize, at least partially explaining the differential chlorate tolerance and Low-N sensitivity between B73 and Ki11. The findings in this work provide unique insights and promising candidates for maize breeding to reduce unnecessary N overuse."
39399216,kernel type,Genetic architecture of kernel-related traits in sweet and waxy maize revealed by genome-wide association analysis.,"Introduction: Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide, the kernel size-related traits are the major components of maize grain yield. 

Methods: To dissect the genetic architecture of four kernel-related traits of 100-kernel weight, kernel length, kernel width, and kernel diameter, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in the waxy and sweet maize panel comprising of 447 maize inbred lines re-sequenced at the 5× coverage depth. GWAS analysis was carried out with the mixed linear model using 1,684,029 high-quality SNP markers. 

Results: In total, 49 SNPs significantly associated with the four kernel-related traits were identified, including 46 SNPs on chromosome 3, two SNPs on chromosome 4, and one SNP on chromosome 7. Haplotype regression analysis identified 338 haplotypes that significantly affected these four kernel-related traits. Genomic selection (GS) results revealed that a set of 10,000 SNPs and a training population size of 30% are sufficient for the application of GS in waxy and sweet maize breeding for kernel weight and kernel size. Forty candidate genes associated with the four kernel-related traits were identified, including both Zm00001d000707 and Zm00001d044139 expressed in the kernel development tissues and stages with unknown functions. 

Discussion: These significant SNPs and important haplotypes provide valuable information for developing functional markers for the implementation of marker-assisted selection in breeding. The molecular mechanism of Zm00001d000707 and Zm00001d044139 regulating these kernel-related traits needs to be investigated further."
39403866,response to maize lethal necrosis,Edited eukaryotic translation initiation factors confer resistance against maize lethal necrosis.,"Maize lethal necrosis (MLN), which is caused by maize chlorotic mottle virus along with a potyvirus, has threatened the food security of smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa. Mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs), which also facilitate virus genome translation, are known to confer variable resistance against viruses. Following phylogenetic analysis, we selected two eIF4E proteins from maize as the most likely candidates to facilitate MLN infection. A knockout (KO) of each of the corresponding genes in elite but MLN-susceptible maize lines conferred only partial protection. Our inability to knockout both the genes together suggested that at least one was required for survival. When we edited (ED) the eIF4E genes in Mini Maize, however, the plants with the eif4e1-KO became highly resistant, whereas those with the eif4e2-KO remained susceptible. Neither of the causal viruses could be detected in the MLN-inoculated eif4e1-KO plants. The eIF4E2 cDNA in Mini Maize lacked the entire 4th exon, causing a 22-amino acid in-frame deletion, which shortened the protein to 198 amino acids. When we introduced mutations in the 4th exon of the eIF4E2 gene in two elite, MLN-susceptible lines pre-edited for an eif4e1-KO, we obtained as strong resistance against MLN as in eif4e1-KO Mini Maize. The MLN-inoculated lines with eif4e1-KO/eIF4E2-exon-4ED performed as well as the uninoculated wild-type lines. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 38 amino acids of eIF4E2 are dispensable for normal plant growth but are required for the multiplication of MLN viruses. Our discovery has wide applications across plant species for developing virus-resistant varieties."
39408841,response to salt,Interactions between Brassinosteroids and Strigolactones in Alleviating Salt Stress in Maize.,"Exogenous brassinolide (BR) and strigolactones (SLs) play an important role in alleviating salt stress in maize. We studied the morphological and physiological responses of the salt-sensitive genotype PH4CV and salt-tolerant genotype Zheng58 to BR (1.65 nM), SL (1 µM), and BS (1.65 nM BR + 1 µM SL) under salt stress. Phenotypic analysis showed that salt stress significantly inhibited the growth of maize seedlings and significantly increased the content of Na+ in the roots. Exogenous hormones increased oxidase activity and decreased Na+ content in the roots and mitigated salt stress. Transcriptome analysis showed that the interaction of BR and SL is involved in photosynthesis-antenna proteins, the TCA cycle, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. This interaction influences the expression of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1 chloroplastic, and aconitase genes are affected. Furthermore, the application of exogenous hormones regulates the expression of genes associated with the signaling pathways of cytokinin (CK), gibberellins (GA), auxin (IAA), brassinosteroid (BR), abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA). Additionally, exogenous hormones inhibit the expression of the AKT2/3 genes, which are responsible for regulating ion transduction and potassium ion influx. Four candidate genes that may regulate the seedling length of maize were screened out through WGCNA. Respective KOG notes concerned inorganic ion transport and metabolism, signal transduction mechanisms, energy production and conversion, and amino acid transport and metabolism. The findings of this study provide a foundation for the proposition that BR and SL can be employed to regulate salt stress alleviation in maize."
39414386,environmental stress response; Abiotic stress response,Maize Abiotic Stress Treatments in Controlled Environments.,"Maize (Zea mays) is one of the world's most important crops, providing food for humans and livestock and serving as a bioenergy source. Climate change and the resulting abiotic stressors in the field reduce crop yields, threatening food security and the global economy. Water deficit (i.e., drought), heat, and insufficient nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) are major environmental stressors that affect maize yields, and impact growth and development at all stages of the plant life cycle. Understanding the biological processes underlying these responses in maize has the potential to increase yields in the face of abiotic stress. Optimizing individual or combined abiotic stress treatments in controlled environments reduces potential noise in data collection that can be present under less controlled growth conditions. Here, we describe methods and conditions for controlled abiotic stress treatments and associated controls during early vegetative growth of maize, conducted in greenhouses or growth chambers. This includes the environmental conditions, equipment, soil preparation, and intensity and duration of heat, drought, nitrogen deficiency, and phosphorous deficiency. Controlled experiments at early growth stages are informative for future in-field studies that require greater labor and inputs, saving researchers time and growing space, and thus research funds, before testing plants across later stages of development. We suggest that stress treatments be severe enough to result in a measurable phenotype, but not so severe that all plants die prior to sample collection. This protocol is designed to set important standards for replicable research in maize."
39414391,drought response; response to heat stress,"Optimized Methods for Applying and Assessing Heat, Drought, and Nutrient Stress of Maize Seedlings in Controlled Environment Experiments.","Maize (Zea mays), also known as corn, is an important crop that plays a crucial role in global agriculture. The economic uses of maize are numerous, including for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. It has had a significant historical importance in research as well, with important discoveries made in maize regarding plant domestication, transposons, heterosis, genomics, and epigenetics. Unfortunately, environmental stresses cause substantial yield loss to maize crops each year. Yield losses are predicted to increase in future climate scenarios, posing a threat to food security and other sectors of the global economy. Developing efficient methods to study maize abiotic stress responses is a crucial step toward a more resilient and productive agricultural system. This review describes the importance of and methods for studying the effects of heat, drought, and nutrient deficiency on early developmental stages of maize grown in controlled environments. Studying the early effects of environmental stressors in controlled environments allows researchers to work with a variety of environmental conditions with low environmental variance, which can inform future field-based research. We highlight the current knowledge of physiological responses of maize to heat, drought, and nutrient stress; remaining knowledge gaps and challenges; and information on how standardized protocols can address these issues."
39414681,response to salt,"Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) conferred salinity tolerance in maize by upregulating E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, P5CS1, HKT1, NHX1, and PMP3 genes","This study explored the transcriptional behaviors of several candidate genes in response to the application of CSNPs (50 and 100 mgl−1) in maize seedlings grown under two salinity levels (NaCl of 0.07 and 0.14 gkg−1soil). Employing CSNPs at both concentrations mitigated the inhibitory role of salinity on the leaf and root fresh weights. The application of CSNPs enhanced the transcription of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase gene by an average of threefold, contrasted with the salinity controls. The Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS1) gene was upregulated in response to both individual and mixed treatments of CSNPs and salinity. The transcription of the high-affinity K+ transporter (HKT1) gene displayed an upward trend in response to the CSNPs and salinity treatments. The Na+/H+ exchangers (NHX1) gene exhibited a similar trend to that of the HKT1 gene. The utilization of CSNPs was accompanied by an upregulation in the plasma membrane proteolipid 3 (PMP3) gene, contrasted with the salinity controls. The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity displayed an upward trend in response to the foliar application of CSNPs. The CSNPs at the 100 mgl−1 concentration were more capable of inducing the ascorbate peroxidase enzyme under both salinity conditions than the 50 mgl−1 dose. The simultaneous exposure of maize seedlings to CSNPs and salinity resulted in the drastic upregulation of the catalase activities. This study provides novel insights into the major mechanisms underlying the stress-mitigating effects of CSNPs, thereby providing a suitable platform for their application in sustainable agricultural practices."
39416480,drought response; response to heat stress,Identification and functional analysis of two serotonin N-acetyltransferase genes in maize and their transcriptional response to abiotic stresses.,"Introduction: Melatonin, a tryptophan-derived indoleamine metabolite with important roles in plant growth and defense, has recently been regarded as a new plant hormone. Maize is one of the most important cereal crops in the world. Although the melatonin receptor gene, ZmPMTR1, has already been identified, the genetic basis of melatonin biosynthesis in maize has still not been elucidated. Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the enzyme that converts serotonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS) or 5-methoxytryptamine (5MT) to melatonin in Arabidopsis and rice, but no SNAT encoding gene has been identified yet in maize. 

Methods: The bioinformatics analysis was used to identify maize SNAT genes and the enzyme activity of the recombinant proteins was determined through in vitro assay. The expression levels of ZmSNAT1 and ZmSNAT3 under drought and heat stresses were revealed by public RNA-seq datasets and qRT-PCR analysis. 

Results: We first identified three maize SNAT genes, ZmSNAT1, ZmSNAT2, and ZmSNAT3, through bioinformatics analysis, and demonstrated that ZmSNAT2 was present in only eight of the 26 cultivars analyzed. We then determined the enzyme activity of ZmSNAT1 and ZmSNAT3 using their recombinant proteins through in vitro assay. The results showed that both ZmSNAT1 and ZmSNAT3 could convert serotonin to NAS and 5-MT to melatonin. Recombinant ZmSNAT1 catalyzed serotonin into NAS with a higher catalytic activity (K m, 8.6 mM; V max, 4050 pmol/min/mg protein) than ZmSNAT3 (K m, 11.51 mM; V max, 142 pmol/min/mg protein). We further demonstrated that the 228th amino acid Tyr (Y228) was essential for the enzymatic activity of ZmSNAT1. Finally, we revealed that the expression of ZmSNAT1 and ZmSNAT3 varied among different maize cultivars and different tissues of a plant, and was responsive to drought and heat stresses. 

Discussion: In summary, the present study identified and characterized the first two functional SNAT genes in maize, laying the foundation for further research on melatonin biosynthesis and its regulatory role in plant growth and response to abiotic stresses."
39420652,response to fall armyworm,Catechol acetylglucose: A newly identified benzoxazinoid-regulated defensive metabolite in maize,"An enormous diversity of specialized metabolites is produced in the plant kingdom, with each individual plant synthesizing thousands of these compounds. Previous research showed that benzoxazinoids, the most abundant class of specialized metabolites in maize, also function as signaling molecules by regulating the production callose as a defense response. We searched for additional benzoxazinoid-regulated specialized metabolites, characterized them, examined whether they too function in herbivore protection, and determined how Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), a prominent maize pest, copes with these metabolites. We identified catechol acetylglucose (CAG) as a benzoxazinoid-regulated metabolite that is produced from salicylic acid via catechol and catechol glucoside. Genome-wide association studies of CAG abundance identified a gene encoding a predicted acetyltransferase. Knockout of this gene resulted in maize plants that lack CAG and over-accumulate catechol glucoside. Upon tissue disruption, maize plants accumulate catechol, which inhibits S. frugiperda growth. Analysis of caterpillar frass showed that S. frugiperda detoxifies catechol by glycosylation, and the efficiency of catechol glycosylation was correlated with S. frugiperda growth on a catechol-containing diet. Thus, the success of S. frugiperda as an agricultural pest may depend partly on its ability to detoxify catechol, which is produced as a defensive metabolite by maize."
39421142,response to selenium,Comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis reveals mechanisms of selenium-regulated anthocyanin synthesis in waxy maize (Zea mays L.).,"Anthocyanins in maize (Zea mays L.) kernels determine the plant's color and can enhance its resistance. Selenium (Se) significantly impacts plant growth, development, and secondary metabolic regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Se regulates anthocyanin synthesis in waxy corn remain unclear. This study employed integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to investigate the mechanisms through which selenium influences anthocyanin synthesis in yellow and purple waxy corn. The results showed that maize varieties with higher anthocyanin content had higher selenium enrichment capacity in their kernels. Under selenium stress, HN2025 exhibited 1,904 more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 140 more differential metabolites compared to HN5. The expression levels of anthocyanin synthesis-related genes and transcription factors such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), chalcone synthase (CHS), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), anthocyanin 5,3-O-glucosyltransferases, and anthocyanidin reductase, MYB, and bHLH were strongly induced in HN2025. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant enrichment in anthocyanin biosynthesis, flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism under selenium treatment. Three up-regulated PAL genes and one C4H gene were significantly enriched with DAMs in phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in significant differences between HN5 and HN2025 in selenium-induced anthocyanin metabolism-related pathways. These findings provide a theoretical basis for understanding the effects of selenium on the molecular regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize kernels."
39421144,response to Exserohilum turcicum,A combination of joint linkage and genome-wide association study reveals putative candidate genes associated with resistance to northern corn leaf blight in tropical maize.,"Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), caused by Setosphaeria turcica, is a major fungal disease affecting maize production in sub-Saharan Africa. Utilizing host plant resistance to mitigate yield losses associated with NCLB can serve as a cost-effective strategy. In this study, we conducted a high-resolution genome-wide association study (GWAS) in an association mapping panel and linkage mapping with three doubled haploid (DH) and three F3 populations of tropical maize. These populations were phenotyped for NCLB resistance across six hotspot environments in Kenya. Across environments and genotypes, NCLB scores ranged from 2.12 to 5.17 (on a scale of 1-9). NCLB disease severity scores exhibited significant genotypic variance and moderate-to-high heritability. From the six biparental populations, 23 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, each explaining between 2.7% and 15.8% of the observed phenotypic variance. Collectively, the detected QTLs explained 34.28%, 51.37%, 41.12%, 12.46%, 12.11%, and 14.66% of the total phenotypic variance in DH populations 1, 2, and 3 and F3 populations 4, 5, and 6, respectively. GWAS, using 337,110 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified 15 marker-trait associations and several putative candidate genes linked to NCLB resistance in maize. Joint linkage association mapping (JLAM) identified 37 QTLs for NCLB resistance. Using linkage mapping, JLAM, and GWAS, several QTLs were identified within the genomic region spanning 4 to 15 Mbp on chromosome 2. This genomic region represents a promising target for enhancing NCLB resistance via marker-assisted breeding. Genome-wide predictions revealed moderate correlations with mean values of 0.45, 0.44, 0.55, and 0.42 for within GWAS panel, DH pop1, DH pop2, and DH pop3, respectively. Prediction by incorporating marker-by-environment interactions did not show much improvement. Overall, our findings indicate that NCLB resistance is quantitative in nature and is controlled by few major-effect and many minor-effect QTLs. We conclude that genomic regions consistently detected across mapping approaches and populations should be prioritized for improving NCLB resistance, while genome-wide prediction results can help incorporate both major- and minor-effect genes. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving maize resistance to NCLB."
39433551,root angle; plant height,Phenotypic characterization and genetic mapping of the semi-dwarf mutant sdw9 in maize.,"In summary, we characterized a maize semi-dwarf mutant, sdw9, and successfully isolated the responsible gene, which encodes a GRAS protein, through a combination of map-based cloning and Re-sequencing (Re-seq). Our findings demonstrate that the candidate gene ZmGRAS42 regulates BR signaling genes, thereby influencing internode development. This regulatory function likely involves processes such as cell division, cell cycle regulation and cell wall synthesis. Favorable variations of ZmGRAS42 identified in this study may hold promise for the development of lodging-resistant maize cultivars suitable for high-density planting, contributing to the improvement of maize breeding programs. Plant height and lateral root angle are crucial determinants of plant architecture in maize (Zea mays) which are closely related to lodging resistance at high planting density. These traits are intricately regulated by various phytohormones. Mutations affecting hormone biosynthesis and signaling often lead to reduced yield alongside diminished plant height, posing challenges in breeding dwarf maize varieties. In this study, the maize mutant sdw9 was characterized, which displays shorter stature and altered lateral root angle compared to WT, while showing potential to increase planting density and improve overall yield despite a slight reduction in single-ear yield. Employing positional cloning coupled with Re-seq techniques, we pinpointed a transposon insertion in the candidate gene ZmGRAS42, which encodes a GRAS transcription factor involved in BR signaling in maize. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ZmGRAS42 orchestrates the expression of several known dwarfing genes such as D8, Br2, and Na2, along with genes associated with cell wall organization, cell division, and cell cycle regulation, notably Cesa4, Cesa7, and Cyc11. Furthermore, identification of favorable ZmGRAS42 haplotypes linked to reduced plant height offers novel avenues for maize breeding strategies. These findings not only hold the potential for enhancing maize lodging resistance but also for optimizing land utilization through high-density planting practices."
39435644,phosphorus use efficiency,Genetic architecture of phosphorus-use-efficiency across diverse environmental conditions: Insights from maize elite and landrace lines.,"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for all crops. Thus, a better understanding of the genetic control of phosphorus-use-efficiency reflected in physiological, developmental, and morphological traits and its environmental plasticity is required to establish the basis for maintaining or enhancing yield while making agriculture more sustainable. In this study, we utilized a diverse panel of maize (Zea mays L.), including 398 elite and landrace lines, phenotyped across three environments and two phosphorus fertilization treatments. We performed genome-wide association mapping for 13 traits, including phosphorus uptake and allocation, that showed a strong environment-dependency in their expression. Our results highlight the complex genetic architecture of phosphorus-use-efficiency as well as the substantial differences between the evaluated genetic backgrounds. Despite harboring more of the identified QTL, almost all of the favourable alleles from landraces were found to be present in at least one of the two elite heterotic groups. Notably, we also observed trait-specific genetic control even among biologically related characteristics, as well as a substantial plasticity of the genetic architecture of several traits in response to the environment and P fertilization. Collectively, our work illustrates the difficulties in improving phosphorus-use-efficiency but also presents possible solutions for the future contribution of plant breeding to improve the phosphorus cycle."
39441092,leaf angle; tassel branch number,Genomic prediction of cereal crop architectural traits using models informed by gene regulatory circuitries from maize,"Plant architecture is a major determinant of planting density, which enhances productivity potential for crops per unit area. Genomic prediction is well positioned to expedite genetic gain of plant architectural traits since they are typically highly heritable. Additionally, the adaptation of genomic prediction models to query predictive abilities of markers tagging certain genomic regions could shed light on the genetic architecture of these traits. Here, we leveraged transcriptional networks from a prior study that contextually described developmental progression during tassel and leaf organogenesis in maize (Zea mays) to inform genomic prediction models for architectural traits. Since these developmental processes underlie tassel branching and leaf angle, 2 important agronomic architectural traits, we tested whether genes prioritized from these networks quantitatively contribute to the genetic architecture of these traits. We used genomic prediction models to evaluate the ability of markers in the vicinity of prioritized network genes to predict breeding values of tassel branching and leaf angle traits for 2 diversity panels in maize and diversity panels from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and rice (Oryza sativa). Predictive abilities of markers near these prioritized network genes were similar to those using whole-genome marker sets. Notably, markers near highly connected transcription factors from core network motifs in maize yielded predictive abilities that were significantly greater than expected by chance in not only maize but also closely related sorghum. We expect that these highly connected regulators are key drivers of architectural variation that are conserved across closely related cereal crop species."
39444137,potassium content,Maize DLR1/NHX7 Is Required for Root Development Under Potassium Deficiency.,"Root System Architecture (RSA) is a crucial plant trait that governs a plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. In this study, we describe a mutant with nutrient-dependent defects in root development, affecting both the primary root and lateral roots (LRs). This mutant, identified through a screen for defects in LR development, has been designated dlr1-1. The dlr1-1 mutant exhibits impaired LR emergence rather than defects in the LR primordium (LRP) formation, particularly under potassium (K+)-deprivation conditions. This impairment likely stems from inhibited cell proliferation caused by the dlr1-1 mutation. K+ deprivation specifically leads to the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) in the dlr1-1 mutant, consistent with the upregulation of SA biosynthesis genes. Moreover, exogenous application of SA to wild-type plants (B73) mimics the dlr1-1 phenotype. Conversely, treatment of the dlr1-1 mutant with 2-aminoindane-2-phosphonic acid, an SA biosynthesis inhibitor, partially restores LR emergence, indicating that elevated SA levels may be responsible for the mutant's developmental defects. MutMap analysis and allelism tests confirmed that the phenotypes of the dlr1-1 mutant results from the loss of the Na+/H+ antiporter, ZmNHX7. Additionally, the application of NaCl exacerbates the dlr1-1 mutant phenotype, suggesting that the root defects in dlr1-1 mutant depend on ion homoeostasis. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that maize DLR1/NHX7 is essential for root development under potassium deprivation."
39444139,drought response,Division Zone Activity Determines the Potential of Drought-Stressed Maize Leaves to Resume Growth after Rehydration.,"Drought is one of the most devastating causes of yield losses in crops like maize, and the anticipated increases in severity and duration of drought spells due to climate change pose an imminent threat to agricultural productivity. To understand the drought response, phenotypic and molecular studies are typically performed at a given time point after drought onset, representing a steady-state adaptation response. Because growth is a dynamic process, we monitored the drought response with high temporal resolution and examined cellular and transcriptomic changes after rehydration at 4 and 6 days after leaf four appearance. These data showed that division zone activity is a determinant for full organ growth recovery upon rehydration. Moreover, a prolonged maintenance of cell division by the ectopic expression of PLASTOCHRON1 extends the ability to resume growth after rehydration. The transcriptome analysis indicated that GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS (GRFs) affect leaf growth by impacting cell division duration, which was confirmed by a prolonged recovery potential of the GRF1-overexpression line after rehydration. Finally, we used a multiplex genome editing approach to evaluate the most promising differentially expressed genes from the transcriptome study and as such narrowed down the gene space from 40 to seven genes for future functional characterization."
39446310,response to Exserohilum turcicum,Experimental evaluation of effectiveness of genomic selection for resistance to northern corn leaf blight in maize.,"Northern corn leaf blight (NLB) caused by Setosphaeria turcica (Luttrell) Leonard & Suggs is a severe foliar disease in maize. Resistance to NLB is complexly inherited and controlled by several quantitative trait loci (QTL) distributed across the genome. Phenotype and DNA marker-based selection for resistance to NLB is expected to be effective. Hence, an investigation was carried out to predict the genetic value of selection candidates for resistance to NLB and compare the accuracies of genomic prediction in two F2:3 populations of two crosses (CM212 × MAI172; CM202 × SKV50) derived from contrasting parents. Linkage analysis using 297 polymorphic SNPs in population-1 and 290 polymorphic SNPs in population-2 revealed ten linkage groups spanning 3623.88 cM and 4261.92 cM with an average distance of 12.40 cM and 14.9 cM in population-1 and population-2, respectively. Location-wise and pooled data across locations identified common QTLs on linkage groups 1 and 6 in population-1 and 3 and 8 in population-2. The prediction accuracy of the QTL mapping (9.92 and 9.10 for population-1 and population-2, respectively) was based on only a few markers, which explained higher percent phenotypic variation. The prediction accuracies of the genomic estimated breeding values in the present investigation were relatively low in population-1 (0.24 to 0.26) and population-2 (0.29-0.32) compared to the expected accuracies. This could be due to fewer polymorphic markers and a small training/population size. Though the GS prediction accuracies were relatively low, they were significantly higher than QTL mapping, which promises better genetic gain per cycle. The resistant progenies from both populations were advanced to derive inbred lines and crossed with four different testers in line × tester mating design to test for their combining ability and effectiveness of genomic selection. High overall general combining ability was exhibited by 21 inbred lines. Among F1s, 48% were assigned high overall specific combining ability status. Out of the 136 single crosses, seven recorded significant positive standard heterosis over the best check for grain yield. Twenty-five inbreds with high GEBVs were crossed with four testers to obtain 100 F1s and evaluated for their response to NLB. The majority of hybrids displayed moderate to resistant reaction to NLB either in combination with susceptible or resistant testers indicating the effectiveness of selection based on high GEBVs."
39447642,response to Fusarium ear rot; response to Aspergillus flavus,Regulatory balance between ear rot resistance and grain yield and their breeding applications in maize and other crops.,"Background: Fungi are prevalent pathogens that cause substantial yield losses of major crops. Ear rot (ER), which is primarily induced by Fusarium or Aspergillus species, poses a significant challenge to maize production worldwide. ER resistance is regulated by several small effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). To date, only a few ER-related genes have been identified that impede molecular breeding efforts to breed ER-resistant maize varieties. 

Aim: of review: Our aim here is to explore the research progress and mine genic resources related to ER resistance, and to propose a regulatory model elucidating the ER-resistant mechanism in maize as well as a trade-off model illustrating how crops balance fungal resistance and grain yield. 

Key Scientific Concepts of Review: This review presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the research history and current trends in the genetic and molecular regulation underlying ER resistance in maize. Moreover, we analyzed and discovered the genic resources by identifying 162 environmentally stable loci (ESLs) from various independent forward genetics studies as well as 1391 conservatively differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that respond to Fusarium or Aspergillus infection through multi-omics data analysis. Additionally, this review discusses the syntenies found among maize ER, wheat Fusariumhead blight (FHB), and rice Bakanaedisease (RBD) resistance-related loci, along with the significant overlap between fungal resistance loci and reported yield-related loci, thus providing valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the trade-offs between yield and defense in crops. 

Highlights: 
    •    Infection caused by pathogenic fungi is a significant factor contributing to the reduction in crop yield and deterioration in grain quality. 
    •    Integrative analyses of diverse independent forward genetics studies and multi-omics data enable the identification of valuable genic resource 
    •    Extensive syntenic relationships are observed among resistance-related loci for maize ER, wheat FHB, and rice RBD. 
    •    Genetic loci regulating both resistance and yield identified here provide potential targets for manipulating the growth-defense trade-off during crop breeding."
39450589,nitrogen content,Metabolic engineering of the serine/glycine network as a means to improve the nitrogen content of crops.,"In plants, L-serine (Ser) biosynthesis occurs through various pathways and is highly dependent on the atmospheric CO2 concentration, especially in C3 species, due to the association of the Glycolate Pathway of Ser Biosynthesis (GPSB) with photorespiration. Characterization of a second plant Ser pathway, the Phosphorylated Pathway of Ser Biosynthesis (PPSB), revealed that it is at the crossroads of carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism. The PPSB comprises three sequential reactions catalysed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), 3-phosphoSer aminotransferase (PSAT) and 3-phosphoSer phosphatase (PSP). PPSB was overexpressed in plants exhibiting two different modes of photosynthesis: Arabidopsis (C3 metabolism), and maize (C4 metabolism), under ambient (aCO2) and elevated (eCO2) CO2 growth conditions. Overexpression in Arabidopsis of the PGDH1 gene alone or PGDH1, PSAT1 and PSP1 in combination increased the Ser levels but also the essential amino acids threonine (aCO2), isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine and methionine (eCO2) compared to the wild-type. These increases translated into higher protein levels. Likewise, starch levels were also increased in the PPSB-overexpressing lines. In maize, PPSB-deficient lines were obtained by targeting PSP1 using Cas9 endonuclease. We concluded that the expression of PPSB in maize male gametophyte is required for viable pollen development. Maize lines overexpressing the AtPGDH1 gene only displayed higher protein levels but not starch at both aCO2 and eCO2 conditions, this translated into a significant rise in the nitrogen/carbon ratio. These results suggest that metabolic engineering of PPSB in crops could enhance nitrogen content, particularly under upcoming eCO2 conditions where the activity of GPSB is limited."
39454297,response to high pH,Alkaline tolerance in plants: The AT1 gene and beyond.,"Salt stress poses a serious challenge to crop production and a significant threat to global food security and ecosystem sustainability. Soil salinization commonly occurs in conjunction with alkalization, which causes combined saline-alkaline stress. Alkaline soil predominantly comprises NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 and is characterized by a high pH. The combined saline-alkaline stress is more harmful to crop production than neutral salt stress owing to the effects of both elevated salinity and high pH stress. Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a recent study has identified Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1) as a contributor to alkaline sensitivity in crops. AT1, which is the first gene to be identified as being specifically associated with alkaline tolerance, encodes a G protein γ-subunit (Gγ). Editing of AT1 enhances the yields of sorghum, rice, maize, and millet grown in alkaline soils, indicating that AT1 has potential for generating alkaline-resistant crops. In this review, we summarize the role of AT1 in alkaline tolerance in plants and present a phylogenetic analysis along with a motif comparison of Gγ subunits of monocot and dicot plants across various species."
39456131,response to salt,ZmKTF1 promotes salt tolerance by mediating RNA-directed DNA methylation in maize.,"The epigenetic process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) regulates the expression of genes and transposons. However, little is known about the involvement of RdDM in the response of maize (Zea mays) to salt stress. Here, we isolated a salt-sensitive maize mutant and cloned the underlying gene, which encodes KOW DOMAIN-CONTAINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (KTF1), an essential component of the RdDM pathway. Evolutionary analysis identified two homologs of KTF1 (ZmKTF1A and ZmKTF1B) with highly similar expression patterns. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that mutations in ZmKTF1 substantially decrease genome-wide CHH (H = A, C, or T) methylation levels. Moreover, our findings suggest that ZmKTF1-mediated DNA methylation regulates the expression of multiple key genes involved in oxidoreductase activity upon exposure to salt, concomitant with increased levels of reactive oxygen species. In addition, insertion-deletion mutations (InDels) in the promoter of ZmKTF1 affect its expression, thereby altering Na+ concentrations in seedlings in a natural maize population. Therefore, ZmKTF1 might represent an untapped epigenetic resource for improving salt tolerance in maize. Overall, our work demonstrates the critical role of ZmKTF1 involved in the RdDM pathway in maize salt tolerance."
39462452,leaf canopy architecture; plant height,Temporally resolved growth patterns reveal novel information about the polygenic nature of complex quantitative traits.,"Plant height can be an indicator of plant health across environments and used to identify superior genotypes. Typically plant height is measured at a single timepoint when plants reach terminal height. Evaluating plant height using unoccupied aerial vehicles allows for measurements throughout the growing season, facilitating a better understanding of plant-environment interactions and the genetic basis of this complex trait. To assess variation throughout development, plant height data was collected from planting until terminal height at anthesis (14 flights 2018, 27 in 2019, 12 in 2020, and 11 in 2021) for a panel of ~500 diverse maize inbred lines. The percent variance explained in plant height throughout the season was significantly explained by genotype (9-48%), year (4-52%), and genotype-by-year interactions (14-36%) to varying extents throughout development. Genome-wide association studies revealed 717 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plant height and growth rate at different parts of the growing season specific to certain phases of vegetative growth. When plant height growth curves were compared to growth curves estimated from canopy cover, greater Fréchet distance stability was observed in plant height growth curves than for canopy cover. This indicated canopy cover may be more useful for understanding environmental modulation of overall plant growth and plant height better for understanding genotypic modulation of overall plant growth. This study demonstrated that substantial information can be gained from high temporal resolution data to understand how plants differentially interact with the environment and can enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of complex polygenic traits."
39462465,drought response,ZmSCE1a positively regulates drought tolerance by enhancing the stability of ZmGCN5.,"Drought stress impairs plant growth and poses a serious threat to maize (Zea mays) production and yield. Nevertheless, the elucidation of the molecular basis of drought resistance in maize is still uncertain. In this study, we identified ZmSCE1a, a SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme, as a positive regulator of drought tolerance in maize. Molecular and biochemical assays indicated that E3 SUMO ligase ZmMMS21 acts together with ZmSCE1a to SUMOylate histone acetyltransferase complexes (ZmGCN5-ZmADA2b). SUMOylation of ZmGCN5 enhances its stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, ZmGCN5-overexpressing plants showed drought tolerance performance. It alleviated   O 2 -  $$ {\mathrm{O}}_2^{-} $$  accumulation, malondialdehyde content, and ion permeability. What's more, the transcripts of stress-responsive genes and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent genes were also significantly upregulated in ZmGCN5-overexpressing plants under drought stress. Overexpression of ZmGCN5 enhanced drought-induced ABA production in seedlings. Taken together, our results indicate that ZmSCE1a enhances the stability of ZmGCN5, thereby alleviating drought-induced oxidative damage and enhancing drought stress response in maize."
39476328,dormancy,Myosin-binding protein 13 mediates primary seed dormancy via abscisic acid biosynthesis and signaling in Arabidopsis.,"Dormancy is an essential characteristic that enables seeds to survive in unfavorable conditions while germinating when conditions are favorable. Myosin-binding proteins (MyoBs) assist in the movement of organelles along actin microfilaments by attaching to both organelles and myosins. In contrast to studies on yeast and metazoans, research on plant MyoBs is still in its early stages and primarily focuses on tip-growing cells. In this study, we found that Arabidopsis MyoB13 is highly expressed in dry mature seeds. The myob13 mutant, created using CRISPR/Cas9, exhibits a preharvest sprouting phenotype, which can be mitigated by after-ripening treatment, indicating that MyoB13 plays a positive role in primary seed dormancy. Furthermore, we show that MyoB13 negatively regulates ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathways. Notably, the expression of MyoB13 orthologs from maize and soybean can completely restore the phenotype of the Arabidopsis myob13 mutant, suggesting that the function of MyoB13 in ABA-induced seed dormancy is evolutionarily conserved. Therefore, the functional characterization of MyoB13 offers an additional genetic resource to help prevent vivipary in crop species."
39477537,hormone response,The Rolled Towel Method for Hormone Response Assays in Maize.,"The rolled towel assay (RTA) is a soil-free method to evaluate juvenile phenotypes in crops such as maize and soybean. Here, we provide an updated RTA-based protocol to phenotype maize seedling responses to chemicals of interest. We exemplify the protocol with two synthetic auxin herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and picloram), an auxin precursor (indole-3-butyric acid), and an auxin inhibitor (N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid), but the method can be used with other hormones or plant growth regulators that are soluble in growth media. We also include instructions on how to annotate root traits and analyze primary root length trait data. The protocol can be scaled up for use in genetic screens, preparing tissue for gene expression analyses, carrying out genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification."
39477538,hormone response,Exogenous Hormone Treatments in Maize.,"Plant hormones have key functions in plant morphology, physiology, and stress responses. Studies on the biology of hormones and their effect on plant physiology and metabolism are greatly facilitated by the exogenous application of these compounds. In general, methods for exogenous hormone application are easy and fast, and provide useful information about their effects in planta. Although hormone effects have been studied in several plant species, the used methods need to be tailored specifically to each species to get robust data. Maize is an established model for basic and applied research, and an excellent system for studying the effects of hormones on developmental and stress responses in a cereal crop. Different methods have been reported for the exogenous application of plant growth regulators in maize, including watering, spraying, immersion, and application to the apical whorl. These various methods are useful to analyze hormone responses at different developmental stages, in specific organs, and within tissues. As with all exogenous application assays, suitable experimental design and the inclusion of proper controls are critical factors in these methods, to obtain reliable and reproducible results. Here, we provide an overview of various methods for hormone exogenous application in maize, and technical considerations to get successful results."
39477539,hormone response,Apical Whorl Treatment for Exogenous Application of Hormones in Maize.,"Plant hormones play an essential role in both development and stress responses. These organic natural compounds have critical functions in plant-related processes, including but not limited to seed development, anther formation, root elongation, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress. One way to study the impact of hormones on these processes is by external application, followed by evaluation of parameters of interest. Here, we describe one such method for the exogenous application of hormones in maize: the apical whorl treatment approach, which is well suited for evaluating the role of these compounds in reproductive stages (e.g., when the target organ is the inflorescence meristem). This method involves direct application of a hormone solution to the apical part of the plants every 2 days until the tassel emerges, which takes 15-20 days, or until the treated plants show noticeable phenotypic changes for evaluation. This method is ideal for observing effects on the apical meristem, and it may be scaled up for analyzing large numbers of plants."
39477540,hormone response,Foliar Spray Treatment for Exogenous Application of Hormones in Maize.,"Exogenous application of hormones in plants is a valuable technique for studying and manipulating plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. The foliar spray method is one of the most common approaches for the exogenous application of hormones in plants due to its ease of use on aerial organs (such as leaves and inflorescences) and the rapid absorption of the treated tissue, facilitating subsequent analyses. Here, we provide a protocol to implement this method in maize. The approach consists of preparing dilutions of the hormones or plant growth regulators (PGRs) of interest, usually in an aqueous solution and at low concentrations, followed by application by foliar spraying using a defined treatment regimen. Users can then evaluate effects by measuring different parameters, such as stem size, flowering time, seed production, or others. The foliar spray method can easily be scaled up and automated in greenhouse and field settings, and can be used to treat plants at all developmental stages."
39479536,response to Fusarium stalk rot,Stalks and roots are the main battlefield for the coevolution between maize and Fusarium verticillioides.,"Fusarium species are the dominant cause of maize ear rot, but they also inflict serious damage to the roots and stalks. Theoretically, the organ where the host interacts with the pathogen most frequently should exhibit the highest degree of symptom-genotype correlation. Because that symptom-genotype correlation is an indicator reflecting the degree of coevolution between pathogen and its hosts. We wonder which organ is the main battlefield for the antagonism between maize and Fusarium. For this purpose, 43 isolates of Fusarium were isolated from infected maize ears. Fusarium verticillioides and F. graminearum are the two dominant pathogens, accounting for 44% and 30%, respectively. Furthermore, 14 elite maize inbreds were exposed to 43 Fusarium isolates and the symptoms of ear rot, stalk rot and root rot were investigated. In general, symptoms caused by F. graminearum were significantly more severe than those caused by other Fusarium species. Surprisingly, the genotype of F. verticillioides showed a strong correlation with stalk and root rot, but not with ear rot. Accordingly, our study may provide the first evidence that the stalk and root of maize, rather than the ear, is the main battlefield for the coevolution between maize and F. verticillioides."
39479550,chlorophyll content,Hyperspectral indices data fusion-based machine learning enhanced by MRMR algorithm for estimating maize chlorophyll content.,"Accurate estimation of chlorophyll is essential for monitoring maize health and growth, for which hyperspectral imaging provides rich data. In this context, this paper presents an innovative method to estimate maize chlorophyll by combining hyperspectral indices and advanced machine learning models. The methodology of this study focuses on the development of machine learning models using proprietary hyperspectral indices to estimate corn chlorophyll content. Six advanced machine learning models were used, including robust linear stepwise regression, support vector machines (SVM), fine Gaussian SVM, Matern 5/2 Gaussian stepwise regression, and three-layer neural network. The MRMR algorithm was integrated into the process to improve feature selection by identifying the most informative spectral bands, thereby reducing data redundancy and improving model performance. The results showed significant differences in the performance of the six machine learning models applied to chlorophyll estimation. Among the models, the Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression model showed the highest prediction accuracy. The model achieved R2 = 0.71 for the training set, RMSE = 338.46 µg/g and MAE = 264.30 µg/g. In the case of the validation set, the Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression model further improved its performance, reaching R2 =0.79, RMSE=296.37 µg/g, MAE=237.12 µg/g. These metrics show that Matern's 5/2 Gaussian process regression model combined with the MRMR algorithm to select optimal traits is highly effective in predicting corn chlorophyll content. This research has important implications for precision agriculture, particularly for real-time monitoring and management of crop health. Accurate estimation of chlorophyll allows farmers to take timely and targeted action."
39482880,response to Pythium aphanidermatum stalk rot,Natural variation in maize ZmLecRK1 fine-tunes co-receptor interactions to boost immunity.,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are integral to plant immunity, functioning as the first line of defense against pathogens. Among these, receptor kinases (RKs) play a critical role in recognizing external signals and initiating immune responses. Recent studies by Li et al. (2024) have identified the G-type lectin receptor kinase ZmLecRK1 in maize as essential for resistance to Pythium aphanidermatum and other fungal pathogens. A key finding is that a resistant variant of ZmLecRK1, which carries an alanine at position 404, has emerged in maize, while the ancestral form, with a serine at this position, is conserved across most grasses. This amino acid substitution significantly influences the interaction with the co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1), enhancing immune complex formation and subsequent defense signaling. This work underscores the importance of genetic variation in enhancing disease resistance, offering potential strategies for crop improvement through targeted genetic modification."
39485941,plant height,A MYB transcription factor underlying plant height in sorghum qHT7.1 and maize Brachytic 1 loci.,"Manipulating plant height is an essential component of crop improvement. Plant height was generally reduced through breeding in wheat, rice, and sorghum to resist lodging and increase grain yield but kept high for bioenergy crops. Here, we positionally cloned a plant height quantitative trait locus (QTL) qHT7.1 as a MYB transcription factor controlling internode elongation, cell proliferation, and cell morphology in sorghum. A 740 bp transposable element insertion in the intronic region caused a partial mis-splicing event, generating a novel transcript that included an additional exon and a premature stop codon, leading to short plant height. The dominant allele had an overall higher expression than the recessive allele across development and internode position, while both alleles' expressions peaked at 46 days after planting and progressively decreased from the top to lower internodes. The orthologue of qHT7.1 was identified to underlie the brachytic1 (br1) locus in maize. A large insertion in exon 3 and a 160 bp insertion at the promoter region were identified in the br1 mutant, while an 18 bp promoter insertion was found to be associated with reduced plant height in a natural recessive allele. CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene knockout of br1 in two maize inbred lines showed significant plant height reduction. These findings revealed functional connections across natural, mutant, and edited alleles of this MYB transcription factor in sorghum and maize. This enriched our understanding of plant height regulation and enhanced our toolbox for fine-tuning plant height for crop improvement."
39496881,response to multiple leaf diseases,The ZmCPK39–ZmDi19–ZmPR10 immune module regulates quantitative resistance to multiple foliar diseases in maize,"Gray leaf spot, northern leaf blight and southern leaf blight are three of the most destructive foliar diseases affecting maize (Zea mays L.). Here we identified a gene, ZmCPK39, that encodes a calcium-dependent protein kinase and negatively regulates quantitative resistance to these three diseases. The ZmCPK39 allele in the resistant line displayed significantly lower pathogen-induced gene expression than that in the susceptible line. A marked decrease in ZmCPK39 abundance mitigated the phosphorylation and degradation of the transcription factor ZmDi19. This led to elevated expression of ZmPR10, a gene known to encode an antimicrobial protein, thereby enhancing maize resistance to foliar diseases. Moreover, the F1 hybrid with reduced ZmCPK39 expression favored disease resistance, thereby increasing yield. Hence, the discovery of the ZmCPK39–ZmDi19–ZmPR10 immune module provides insight into the mechanisms underlying broad-spectrum quantitative disease resistance and also offers a new avenue for the genetic control of maize foliar diseases."
39506700,response to heat stress,ZmHsp18 screened from the ZmHsp20 gene family confers thermotolerance in maize,"Heat stress has become one of the abiotic stresses that pose an increasing threat to maize production due to global warming. The Hsp20 gene family confers tolerance to various abiotic stresses in plants. However, very few Hsp20s have been identified in relation to maize thermotolerance. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of Hsp20s involved in thermotolerance in maize. A total of 33 maize Hsp20 genes (ZmHsp20s) were identified through scanning for a conserved α-crystalline domain (ACD), and they were categorized into 14 subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. These genes are distributed across all maize chromosomes and nine of them are in regions previously identified as heat-tolerance quantitative trait loci (hrQTL). These hrQTL-associated ZmHsp20s show variation in tissue-specific expression profiles under normal conditions, and seven of them possess 1–5 heat stress elements in their promoters. The integration of RNA-seq data with real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that ZmHsp23.4, ZmHsp22.8B and ZmHsp18 were dramatically induced under heat stress. Additionally, these genes exhibited co-expression patterns with key ZmHsfs, which are crucial in the heat tolerance pathway. When a null mutant carrying a frame-shifted ZmHsp18 gene was subjected to heat stress, its survival rate decreased significantly, indicating a critical role of ZmHsp18 in maize thermotolerance. Our study lays the groundwork for further research into the roles of ZmHsp20s in enhancing maize’s thermotolerance."
39508116,response to Exserohilum turcicum,Comparative transcriptome analysis highlights resistance regulatory networks of maize in response to Exserohilum turcicum infection at the early stage.,"Northern corn leaf blight, caused by Exserohilum turcicum (E. turcicum), is one of the most destructive diseases in maize, leading to serious yield losses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of E. turcicum infection response in maize remain unclear. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis in resistant maize inbred line J9D207 (R) and susceptible maize inbred line PH4CV (S) after infecting with E. turcicum at 0 h, 24 h and 72 h, respectively. Compared with 0 h, 9656 (24 h) and 8748 (72 h) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in J9D207, and 7915 (24 h) and 7865 (72 h) DEGs were identified in PH4CV. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis might be involved in maize defense reactions. Some DEGs coded for transcription factors, such as MYB-related, ERF, NAC, bZIP, bHLH and WRKY families, which indicated that they may participate in resistance against E. turcicum. In addition, DEGs involved in SA, JA, ABA and ET signaling pathways were revealed. Moreover, 75 SOD activity-related genes and 421 POD activity-related genes were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), respectively. These results provide a novel insight into the resistance mechanism of maize in response to E. turcicum inoculation."
39533712,flavor,A metabolic roadmap of waxy corn flavor,"As well as being a popular vegetable crop worldwide, waxy corn represents an important amylopectin source. However, little is known about the breeding history and flavor characteristics of this crop. In this study, comparative-omic analyses between 318 diverse waxy corn and 507 representative field corn inbred lines revealed that many metabolic pathways and genes exhibited characteristics of selection during the breeding history of waxy corn, contributing to the divergence between waxy and field corn. We show that waxy corn is not only altered in its glutinous property, but that sweetness, aroma, and palatability are all significantly affected. A substantial proportion (43%) of flavor-related metabolites have pleiotropic effects, impacting both flavor and yield characteristics and 27% of these metabolites are related to antagonistic outcomes on yield and flavor. Furthermore, we demonstrated, through multiple concrete examples, how yield and quality are coordinately or antagonistically regulated at the genetic level. In particular, we identified some sweet molecules such as DIMBOA and raffinose, that do not participate in the starch biosynthesis pathway, as potential targets for breeding a new type of “sweet-waxy” corn. Our findings shed light on the historical selection of waxy corn and demonstrate the genetic and metabolic basis of waxy corn flavor, thereby collectively providing valuable resources and knowledge for future crop breeding for improved nutritional quality."
39535489,alpha tocopherol level,Overexpression of ZmSPS2 increases α/γ-tocopherol ratio to improve maize nutritional quality.,"In summary, we demonstrated that ZmSPS2 regulated the α/γ-tocopherol ratio for enhancing α-tocopherol content in maize, and overexpression of ZmSPS2 resulted in an increase in α-tocopherol content and high α/γ-tocopherol ratio. Furthermore, our results also provide the elite haploid of ZmSPS2 for maize nutritional quality breeding."
39544423,response to seed aging,"Impact of accelerated aging on seed quality, seed coat physical structure and antioxidant enzyme activity of Maize (Zea mays L.).","Aging induces many deteriorative changes to seeds during storage like protein degradation, enzyme inactivation and loss of membrane integrity. In this study, we investigate the impact of accelerated aging on seed quality, seed coat physical structure and antioxidant enzyme activity of maize. Three genotypes African Tall, MAH 14-5 and a local landrace were selected and artificially aged for 96 and 120 h. The aging process led to a decrease in germination, vigour, and total dehydrogenase in seeds, while the electrical conductivity of seed leachates increased, indicating a decline in seed quality. Additionally, there was a variation in the microsculpture pattern of seed coats between genotypes. There was an accumulation of damage on the seed coat surface as the seeds aged and higher damage occurred in African Tall followed by MAH 14-5 and local landrace. Higher catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity were reported in the seed coat of Local landrace and MAH 14-5 that resisted aging and deterioration while, lower catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity was reported in African Tall seed coat that deteriorated during aging. Decrease antioxidant activity in aged seeds might be a possible cause of seed deterioration due to the accumulation of free radicals. Thus, these results clearly show the influence of seed coat structure and antioxidant activity on seed quality during aging."
39547547,drought response; response to salt,An LRR-RLK protein modulates drought- and salt-stress responses in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays), which is a vital source of food, feed, and energy feedstock globally, has significant potential for higher yields. However, environmental stress conditions, including drought and salt stress, severely restrict maize plant growth and development, leading to great yield losses. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but their roles in abiotic stress responses in maize are not entirely understood. In this study, we determine that the LRR-RLK ZmMIK2, a homolog of the Arabidopsis LRR-RK MALE DISCOVERER 1 (MDIS1)- INTERACTING RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2), functions in resistance to both drought and salt stress in maize. Zmmik2 plants exhibit enhanced resistance to both stresses, whereas overexpressing ZmMIK2 confers the opposite phenotypes. Furthermore, we identify C2-DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1 (ZmC2DP1), which interacts with the intracellular region of ZmMIK2. Notably, that region of ZmMIK2 mediates the phosphorylation of ZmC2DP1, likely by increasing its stability. Both ZmMIK2 and ZmC2DP1 are mainly expressed in roots. As with ZmMIK2, knockout of ZmC2DP1 enhanced resistance to both drought and salt stress. We conclude that ZmMIK2-ZmC2DP1 act as a negative regulatory module in maize drought- and salt-stress responses."
39549574,response to heavy metals,"Silicon might mitigate nickel toxicity in maize roots via chelation, detoxification, and membrane transport.","Nickel is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development. However, in excessive amounts caused by accidental pollution of soils, this heavy metal is toxic to plants. Although silicon is a non-essential nutrient, it accumulates in most monocots, particularly the vital crop maize (corn, Zea mays). In fact, this metalloid mineral can alleviate the toxicity of heavy metals, though the mechanism is not entirely clear yet. Herein, we measured proteome, gene expression, enzyme activities, and selected sugars to investigate such effect thoroughly. Deep proteomic analysis revealed a minor impact of 100 µM Ni, 2.5 mM Si, or their combination on roots in 12-day-old hydroponically grown maize seedlings upon 9 days of exposure. Nonetheless, we suggested plausible mechanisms of Si mitigation of excessive Ni: Chelation by metallothioneins and phytochelatins, detoxification by glycine betaine pathway, and restructuring of plasma membrane transporters. Higher activity of glutathione S-transferase confirmed its plausible involvement in reducing Ni toxicity in combined treatment. Accumulation of sucrose synthase and corresponding soluble sugars in Ni and combined treatment implied high energy requirements both during heavy metal stress and its mitigation. Expression analysis of genes coding a few differentially accumulated proteins failed to reveal concordant changes, indicating posttranscriptional regulation. Proposed mitigation mechanisms should be functionally validated in follow-up studies."
39552518,response to phosphorus,Soil Microbiota Modulates Root Transcriptome With Divergent Effect on Maize Growth Under Low and High Phosphorus Inputs.,"Plant growth can be promoted by beneficial microorganisms, or inhibited by detrimental ones. Although the interaction process between a single microbial species and its host has been extensively studied, the growth and transcriptional response of the host to soil microbiota is poorly understood. We planted maize in natural or sterile soil collected from a long-term experimental site with two different soil phosphate (P) regimes. We examined the composition of microbial communities inhabiting root-associated niches in natural soil. In parallel, we determined the biomass, ionomes, and root transcriptome profiling of maize grown in natural or sterile soil. Soil microbiota could promote or inhibit different P starvation-responsive (PSR) genes, as well as induce several defense-related metabolic processes independently of external P levels. Soil microbiota accompanied by long-term application of P fertilizer induced lower intensity of PSR and defense responses, inhibiting maize growth. Under a low P regime, the PSR and defense responses were induced to a higher extent, promoting P absorption and growth. Our findings suggest a soil P-dependent effect of microbiota on maize growth by integrating PSR and defense responses and provide a more refined understanding of the interaction between root growth and soil microbiota."
39555599,plant height,The C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor ZmDi19-7 regulates plant height and organ size by promoting cell size in maize.,"The drought-induced protein 19 (Di19) gene family encodes a Cys2/His2 zinc-finger protein implicated in responses to diverse plant stressors. To date, potential roles of these proteins as transcription factors remain largely elusive in maize. Here, we show that ZmDi19-7 gene exerts pivotal functions in regulation of plant height and organ growth by modulating the cell size in maize. ZmDi19-7 physically interacts with ubiquitin receptor protein ZmDAR1b, which is indispensable in ubiquitination of ZmDi19-7 and affects its protein stability. Further genetic analysis demonstrated that ZmDAR1b act in a common pathway with ZmDi19-7 to regulate cell size in maize. ZmDi19-7, severing as a transcriptional factor, is significantly enriched in conserved DiBS element in the promoter region of ZmHSP22, ZmHSP18c, ZmSAUR25, ZmSAUR55, ZmSAUR7 and ZmXTH23 and orchestrates the expression of these genes involving in auxin-mediated cell expansion and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, our findings demonstrate that ZmDi19-7 is an important newfound component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in regulation of plant height and organ size in maize. These discoveries highlight potential targets for the genetic improvement of maize in the future."
39557680,kernel row number,Identification and segregation of two closely linked major QTLs for kernel row number in advanced maize-teosinte populations.,"Two closely linked novel loci, qKRN2-1 and qKRN2-2, associated with kernel row number were fine-mapped on chromosome 2, and a key candidate gene for qKRN2-1 was identified through expression analysis. Kernel row number (KRN) is a crucial factor influencing maize yield and serves as a significant target for maize breeding. The use of wild progenitor species can aid in identifying the essential traits for domestication and breeding. In this study, teosinte (MT1) served as the donor parent, the inbred maize line of Mo17 was used as the recurrent parent, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for KRN, designated qKRN2, into two closely linked loci, qKRN2-1 and qKRN2-2. Here, fine mapping was performed to investigate two QTLs, qKRN2-1 and qKRN2-2, within a genomic range of 272 kb and 775 kb, respectively. This was achieved using a progeny test strategy in an advanced backcross population, with the two QTLs explaining 33.49% and 35.30% of the phenotypic variance. Molecular marker-assisted selection resulted in the development of two nearly isogenic lines (NILs), qKRN2-1 and qKRN2-2, which differed only in the segment containing the QTL. Notably, the maize (Mo17) alleles increased the KRN relative to teosinte by approximately 1.4 and 1.2 rows for qKRN2-1 and qKRN2-2, respectively. Zm00001d002989 encodes a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase and its expression in the immature ears exhibited significant differences among the qKRN2-1 NILs. In situ hybridization localized Zm00001d002989 to the primordia of the inflorescence meristem and spikelet pair meristems, is predicted to be the causal gene of qKRN2-1. The findings of this study deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of KRN and hold significant potential for improving maize grain yields."
39570614,response to gibberellin,Gibberellins: Extending the Green Revolution.,"The Green Revolution more than doubled crop yields and food production in crop species such as wheat and rice. This was primarily accomplished by altering the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway to reduce plant height and prevent plants from falling over when growth was promoted with fertilizer application. Similar approaches have not been successfully accomplished in other grass crops species, such as maize, due to pleiotropic deleterious traits that arise from altering the GA pathway. This review highlights new findings in GA research across grass crop species. We have primarily focused on the developmental role of GAs in plant architecture and growth. We discuss how alteration of GA effects could be used to alter plant morphology and development of ideal plant ideotypes for grass crop species. To further extend the Green Revolution and improve food production from cereal crop species, targeted and tissue specific regulation of the GA pathway will have to be undertaken."
39573992,"protein content, kernel",Discovery of candidate genes enhancing kernel protein content in tropical maize introgression lines.,"Background: In this study, tropical maize germplasms were used to construct a multiparent population (MPP) to identify novel genes associated with kernel protein content. The kernel protein content was quantified using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the MPP, which was evaluated in three different environments. 

Results: QTL mapping revealed 23 significant QTLs tightly linked to kernel protein content, with phenotypic variation ranging from 8.88 to 28.86%. Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) identified 21 SNPs that were significantly associated with kernel protein content, with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranging from 4.09 to 16.15%. Through combined QTL mapping and GWAS, co-localized loci were identified, as well as two novel genes (Zm00001d034933 and Zm00001d029999) that had not been previously reported. 

Conclusions: These genes encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (PPR proteins), which regulate kernel endosperm development. The significant SNPs associated with these genes accounted for 23.59% of the PVE, whereas the QTLs accounted for 46.02% of the phenotypic variation. Since kernel protein synthesis and storage occur in the endosperm, this study suggests that Zm00001d034933 and Zm00001d029999 may potentially regulate kernel protein content in maize."
39574004,response to Fusarium stalk rot; response to Fusarium seedling rot; response to Fusarium ear rot,Transcriptome profiling of eight Zea mays lines identifies genes responsible for the resistance to Fusarium verticillioides.,"Background: The cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most important crops worldwide for food, feed, biofuels, and industrial applications, faces significant constraints due to Fusarium verticillioides, a fungus responsible for severe diseases including seedling blights, stalk rot, and ear rot. Its impact is worsened by the fact that chemical and agronomic measures used to control the infection are often inefficient. Hence, genetic resistance is considered the most reliable resource to reduce the damage. This study aims to elucidate the genetic basis of F. verticillioides resistance in maize. 

Results: Young seedlings of eight divergent maize lines, founders of the MAGIC population, were artificially inoculated with a F. verticillioides strain. Phenotypic analysis and transcriptome sequencing of both control and treated samples identified several hundred differentially expressed genes enriched in metabolic processes associated with terpene synthesis. A WGCNA further refined the pool of genes with potential implications in disease response and found a limited set of hub genes, encoding bZIP and MYB transcription factors, or involved in carbohydrate metabolism, solute transport processes, calcium signaling, and lipid pathways. Finally, additional gene resources were provided by combining transcriptomic data with previous QTL mapping, thereby shedding light on the molecular mechanisms in the maize-F. verticillioides interaction. 

Conclusions: The transcriptome profiling of eight divergent MAGIC maize founder lines with contrasting levels of Fusarium verticillioides resistance combined with phenotypic analysis, clarifies the molecular mechanisms underlying the maize-F. verticillioides interaction."
39574449,osmotic stress response,The maize gene ZmSBP17 encoding an SBP transcription factor confers osmotic resistance in transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Among the major abiotic stresses, salt and drought have considerably affected agricultural development globally by interfering with gene expression profiles and cell metabolism. Transcription factors play crucial roles in activating or inhibiting the expression of stress-related genes in response to abiotic stress in plants. In this study, the Zea mays L. SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein gene (ZmSBP17) was identified, and the molecular regulatory mechanism of osmotic stress tolerance was analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ZmSBP17 is part of the SBP gene family and is closely related to OsSBP17. The ZmSBP17-GFP fusion protein exhibited green fluorescence in the nucleus, as determined via tobacco epidermal transient transformation system. Acting as a transcriptional activator, the overexpression of ZmSBP17 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the expression of genes encoding superoxide dismutases (CSD1/2, MSD1), catalases (CAT1/2), ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1), and myeloblastosis transcription factors (AtMYB53/65), which increased the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes and reduced ROS levels. Additionally, the expression of abiotic stress-related genes, such as AtDREB2A and AtNHX1, was significantly upregulated by ZmSBP17. Furthermore, ZmSBP17 specifically bound to cis-acting elements containing GTAC core sequences in the promoters of stress-related genes, suggesting that ZmSBP17 regulates the transcription of certain genes by recognizing these sequences. These results indicate that the overexpression of ZmSBP17 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly increased tolerance to osmotic stress during the germination and seedling stages, which may enhance our understanding of the biological functions of SBPs in maize under abiotic stresses."
39596447,Stress response,A Critical Review of Recent Advances in Maize Stress Molecular Biology.,"With the intensification of global climate change and environmental stress, research on abiotic and biotic stress resistance in maize is particularly important. High temperatures and drought, low temperatures, heavy metals, salinization, and diseases are widespread stress factors that can reduce maize yields and are a focus of maize-breeding research. Molecular biology provides new opportunities for the study of maize and other plants. This article reviews the physiological and biochemical responses of maize to high temperatures and drought, low temperatures, heavy metals, salinization, and diseases, as well as the molecular mechanisms associated with them. Special attention is given to key transcription factors in signal transduction pathways and their roles in regulating maize stress adaptability. In addition, the application of transcriptomics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and QTL technology provides new strategies for the identification of molecular markers and genes for maize-stress-resistance traits. Crop genetic improvements through gene editing technologies such as the CRISPR/Cas system provide a new avenue for the development of new stress-resistant varieties. These studies not only help to understand the molecular basis of maize stress responses but also provide important scientific evidence for improving crop tolerance through molecular biological methods."
39612313,response to Puccinia polysora,Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of maize cell heterogeneity and systemic immune responses against Puccinia polysora Underw.,"Southern corn rust (SCR), caused by Puccinia polysora Underw (P. polysora), is a catastrophic disease affecting maize, leading to significant global yield losses. The disease manifests primarily as pustules on the upper surface of corn leaves, obscuring our understanding of its cellular heterogeneity, the maize's response to its infection and the underlying gene expression regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we dissected the heterogeneity of maize's response to P. polysora infection using single-cell RNA sequencing. We delineated cell-type-specific gene expression alterations in six leaf cell types, creating the inaugural single-cell atlas of a maize leaf under fungal assault. Crucially, by reconstructing cellular trajectories in susceptible line N110 and resistant line R99 during infection, we identified diverse regulatory programs that fortify R99's resistance across different leaf cell types. This research uncovers an immune-like state in R99 leaves, characterized by the expression of various fungi-induced genes in the absence of fungal infection, particularly in guard and epidermal cells. Our findings also highlight the role of the fungi-induced glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinase 7 protein (ZmChit7) in conferring resistance to P. polysora. Collectively, our results shed light on the mechanisms of maize resistance to fungal pathogens through comparative single-cell transcriptomics, offering a valuable resource for pinpointing novel genes that bolster resistance to P. polysora."
39625501,response to western corn rootworm,Western corn rootworm resistance in maize persists in the absence of jasmonic acid.,"Larva growth, survival, and development speed were not affected by the absence of jasmonic acid (JA) indicating that JA does not have a direct role in maize resistance to western corn rootworm. Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone that regulates multiple physiological processes including defense against herbivory by chewing insects. Previous research showed its importance for resistance to aboveground herbivory. While few studies have investigated the role of JA in resistance to belowground root-feeding herbivores, none has directly tested the role of JA in such resistance. In this study, we used an opr7opr8 double mutant to directly test the role of JA in resistance to western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, WCR), a devastating and specialist pest of maize. The opr7opr8 double mutant is deficient in JA accumulation as we found that it does not accumulate JA nor JA-Ile independently of exposure to WCR. We found no significant difference in growth (body mass), survival, and development of WCR larvae in response to JA deficiency, suggesting that disruption of JA biosynthesis does not impact resistance in maize roots to WCR. Additionally, we observed no significant effect on loss of root tissue caused by WCR associated with JA deficiency, while we found a reduction in shoot growth (mass) associated with WCR herbivory in the opr7opr8 mutant that was not observed in the wildtype. This suggested a role for JA in aboveground growth response to WCR herbivory rather than resistance to WCR."
39645098,shank length; node number,Integration of GWAS models and GS reveals the genetic architecture of ear shank in maize,"Maize is one of the most important crops for human food, animal feed, and industrial raw materials. Ear shank length (ESL) and ear shank node number (ESNN) are crucial selection criteria in maize breeding, impacting grain yield and dehydration rate during mechanical harvesting. To unravel the genetic basis of ESL and ESNN in maize, an association panel consisting of 379 multi-parent doubled-haploid (DH) lines was developed for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). The heritabilities of ESL and ESNN were 0.68 and 0.55, respectively, which were controlled by genetic factors and genotype-environment interaction factors. Using five different models for GWAS, 11 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosomes 1, 2, and 4 were identified for ESL, with the phenotypic variation explained (PVE) value of each single SNP ranging from 4.91% to 21.35%, and 11 significant SNPs located on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 5 were identified for ESNN, with the PVE value of each SNP ranging from 1.22% to 18.42%. Genetic regions in bins 1.06, 2.06, and 2.08 were significantly enriched in SNPs associated with ear shank-related traits. The GS prediction accuracy using all markers by the five-fold cross-validation method for ESL and ESNN was 0.39 and 0.37, respectively, which was significantly improved by using only 500–1000 significant SNPs with the lowest P-values. The optimal training population size (TPS) and marker density (MD) for ear shank-related traits were 50%-60% and 3000, respectively. Our results provide new insights into the GS of ear shank-related traits. 
Highlights: 
    •    Significant SNPs and candidate genes associated with ESL and ESNN in maize were identified. 
    •    The potential of genomic selection for ESL and ESNN was explored. 
    •    The impact of different factors affecting prediction accuracy was evaluated."
39645615,response to Asian corn borer,Phytol-induced interplant signaling in maize facilitates EXP-A20-driven resistance through ACO31-dependent ethylene accumulation against Ostrinia furnacalis.,"Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, including cell wall fortification through lignin biosynthesis. Insect attack primes systemic acquired resistance in plants, preparing them to respond more swiftly and vigorously to subsequent insect assaults. Here, we found that Beauveria bassiana-exposed maize plants can emit phytol upon infestation by Spodoptera frugiperda, inducing plant-to-plant (PTP) communication of alert signals for neighboring plants, and revealed the expansin protein EXP-A20 as a pivotal node mediating maize defense responses in neighboring plants against the destructive pest Ostrinia furnacalis via stimulation of ethylene (ET) synthesis and lignin production. Through virus-induced gene silencing, we showed that EXP-A20 is essential for maize resistance, while downregulating ET and lignin pathways. Critically, protein-protein interactions determined via luciferase complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that EXP-A20 binds to and likely activates the ET-forming enzyme gene ACO31 to initiate defense signaling cascades, representing a novel signaling modality for expansins. Treatment with the plant volatile phytol has known insecticidal/priming activity, but we found that its effectiveness requires EXP-A20. This finding highlights the importance of EXP-A20 upstream of hormone-cell wall crosstalk in defense activation by volatiles. Overall, our multifaceted dissection of EXP-A20 revealed key molecular intersections underlying inducible maize immunity against herbivores. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence that extensive cell growth processes directly stimulate defense programs in plants. Our work opens new avenues for enhancing durable, broad-spectrum pest resistance in maize through the use of volatile organic compounds and PTP interactions."
39658099,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; response to Colletotrichum graminicola; response to fall armyworm,Pentyl leaf volatiles promote insect and pathogen resistance via enhancing ketol-mediated defense responses.,"Plants emit an array of volatile organic compounds in response to stresses. Six-carbon green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and five-carbon pentyl leaf volatiles (PLVs) are fatty acid-derived compounds involved in intra- and inter-species communications. Unlike extensively studied GLVs, the biological activities of PLVs remain understudied. Maize (Zea mays L.) contains a unique monocot-specific lipoxygenase, ZmLOX6, that is unable to oxidize fatty acids and instead possesses a hydroperoxide lyase-like activity to specifically produce PLVs. Here, we show that disruption of ZmLOX6 reduced resistance to fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) and fungal pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola and Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Metabolite profiling revealed that reduced resistance to insects and pathogens was associated with decreased production of PLVs and ketols, including the better studied α-ketol, 9,10-KODA (9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid). Exogenous PLV and 9,10-KODA treatments rescued the resistance of lox6 mutants to FAW and the pathogens. Surprisingly, the susceptible-to-herbivory lox6 mutants produced greater levels of wound-induced jasmonates, suggesting potential substrate competition between JA and PLV pathway branches and highlighting a strong role of PLVs in defense to insects. Similarly, likely due to substrate competition between GLV and PLV synthesis pathways, in response to C. graminicola infection, lox6 mutants accumulated elevated levels of GLVs, which promote susceptibility to this pathogen. Mutation of the GLV-producing ZmLOX10 in the lox6 mutant background reversed the susceptibility to C. graminicola, unveiling the contrasting roles of PLVs and GLVs in resistance to this pathogen. Overall, this study uncovered a potent signaling role of PLVs in defense against insect herbivory and fungal pathogens with distinct lifestyles."
39658544,agrobacterium mediated transformation,Unlocking regeneration potential: harnessing morphogenic regulators and small peptides for enhanced plant engineering.,"Plant genetic transformation is essential for understanding gene functions and developing improved crop varieties. Traditional methods, often genotype-dependent, are limited by plants' recalcitrance to gene delivery and low regeneration capacity. To overcome these limitations, new approaches have emerged that greatly improve efficiency and genotype flexibility. This review summarizes key strategies recently developed for plant transformation, focusing on groundbreaking technologies enhancing explant- and genotype flexibility. It covers the use of morphogenic regulators (MRs), stem cell-based methods, and in planta transformation methods. MRs, such as maize Babyboom (BBM) with Wuschel2 (WUS2), and GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) with their cofactors GRF-interacting factors (GIFs), offer great potential for transforming many monocot species, including major cereal crops. Optimizing BBM/WUS2 expression cassettes has further enabled successful transformation and gene editing using seedling leaves as starting material. This technology lowers the barriers for academic laboratories to adopt monocot transformation systems. For dicot plants, tissue culture-free or in planta transformation methods, with or without the use of MRs, are emerging as more genotype-flexible alternatives to traditional tissue culture-based transformation systems. Additionally, the discovery of the local wound signal peptide Regeneration Factor 1 (REF1) has been shown to enhance transformation efficiency by activating wound-induced regeneration pathways in both monocot and dicot plants. Future research may combine these advances to develop truly genotype-independent transformation methods."
39659013,response to salt,Identification of salt responsive genetic variants using cross-condition multi-omics association analysis in maize.,"In summary, MODAS2 is a novel tool for population-scale multi-omics association analysis. Currently, MODAS2 is primarily applied to multi-omics association analysis involving condition comparisons under single salt stress treatment and control conditions. However, by sequentially comparing population-scale multi-omics data under different stress treatments with control data and integrating the results of multiple comparisons, MODAS2 holds the potential to enable cross-condition multi-omics association analysis. Furthermore, MODAS2 focuses on molecular traits during its analysis, which robustly reflect plant responses to environmental stresses, pathogen infections, and growth and development processes. This feature enables MODAS2 to extended for the identification of dynamic molecular molQTLs associated with stress resistance and growth and development processes, as well as integrating related multi-omics data. These capabilities highlight the significant potential of MODAS2 in unraveling the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits in plants."
39661752,leaf angle,Leaf angle regulation toward a maize smart canopy.,"Dense planting of single-cross hybrids contributes to maize yield increase over the past decades. Leaf angle, an important agronomic trait relevant to planting density, plays a fundamental role in light penetration into the canopy and photosynthetic efficiency. Leaf angle is a key parameter of plant architecture in the concept of smart canopy. Maize smart-canopy-like plant architecture exhibits optimal leaf angle, resulting in erect upper leaves and intermediate or horizontal lower leaves. Leaf angle regulation is a promising way forward in the breeding of varieties with canopy ideotypes. In this review, we first describe the relationship between maize polarity axes and leaf angle formation. Then, we revisit advances in the mutant and quantitative genetics research of maize leaf angle, highlighting the biological implications of transcription factors for maize leaf angle regulation. We underscore that KNOX family is essential for the blade-sheath boundary establishment and brassinosteroid pathway components as well as regulator ZmRAVL1 serve as key hubs of the transcriptional hierarchy governing maize leaf angle formation. We also suggest potential avenues for manipulating maize leaf angles across canopy layers."
39669778,response to Aspergillus fumigatus; response to Aspergillus oryzae,"Drought-tolerant fungal microbes, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus fumigatus, elevate physiohormonal and antioxidant responses of maize under drought stress.","Introduction: Temporary and extended drought stress accelerates phytohormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, however, the fate of the plants under stress is mostly determined by the metabolic and molecular reprogramming, which can be modulated by the application of habitat-adapted fungi that triggers resistance to stress upon symbiotic association. 

Methods: The present research exhibited the exploitation of the newly isolated, drought habitat-adapted fungal endophytic consortium of SAB (Aspergillus oryzae) and CBW (Aspergillus fumigatus), on maize under drought stress. SAB and CBW primarily hosted the root tissues of Conyza bonariensis L., which have not been reported earlier, and sufficiently produced growth-promoting metabolites and antioxidants. 

Results: SAB and CBW adeptly inhabited the maize roots. They promoted biomass, primary metabolites, osmolytes (protein, sugar, lipids, proline, phenolics, flavonoids), and IAA production while reducing tannins, ABA, and H2O2 contents and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities. In addition, the enhanced adventitious root development at the root/stem interface, and elongated main root development optimum stomatal activity of SAB- and CBW-inoculated maize plants were observed under drought stress. SAB and CBW modulated the expression of the ZmBSK1, ZmAPX, and ZmCAT1 genes in the maize shoot and root tissues under drought stress vs. control, signifying an essential regulatory function for SAB/CBW-induced drought stress tolerance via phytohormonal signaling pathway leading to the antioxidant upregulation. 

Discussion: These findings imply that the exogenous administration of the SAB/CBW consortium might be a rather efficient strategy that contributes to optimizing the physio-hormonal attributes and antioxidant potential to alleviate the drought stress in maize."
39672385,drought response,Overexpression of ZmEULD1b enhances maize seminal root elongation and drought tolerance,"Drought stress damages the growth and development of maize, which results in the maize yield reduction. A strong root system improves the drought tolerance in maize. A previous genome-wide association study for the maize seminal root length under drought stress conditions identified a significant SNP, which was located in the ZmEULD1b gene. Here, we show that enhancing ZmEULD1b expression in transgenic maize increases seminal root length, as well as plant tolerance to water deficit. Meanwhile, ZmEULD1b overexpression influences the stomatal development and promotes water-use efficiency of maize. Further, transcriptome analysis of wild type and ZmEULD1b-OE plants show that several peroxidases and ABA-related pathway genes are upregulated in the ZmEULD1b-OE plants under drought stress conditions. Additionally, rhizosphere microbiota analyses of plant root confirm that overexpression of ZmEULD1b improves the abundance of growth-promoting microbes in the maize root system under drought stress conditions. Collectively, the data presented in this work suggest that ZmEULD1b could be a valuable gene resource or selection target for the drought-tolerant genetic improvement of maize. 
Highlights: 
    •    Plant root systems are crucial in water absorption and transport and play a vital role in coping with water stress. 
    •    ZmEULD1b regulats seminal root and stomatal development. 
    •    ZmEULD1b is a positive regulator of drought tolerance in maize seedlings. 
    •    ZmEULD1b promotes the enrichment of growth-promoting rhizosphere microbial communities in the root system under water stress conditions."
39686522,drought response,The SnRK2.2-ZmHsf28-JAZ14/17 module regulates drought tolerance in maize,"Abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are important plant hormones in response to drought stress. We have identified that ZmHsf28 elevated ABA and JA accumulation to confer drought tolerance in maize; however, the underlying mechanism still remains elusive. 
    The knockout line zmhsf28 is generated to confirm the positive role of ZmHsf28 in drought response. Multiple approaches are combined to reveal protein interaction among ZmHsf28, ZmSnRK2.2 and ZmJAZ14/17, which form a regulatory module to mediate maize drought tolerance through regulating ABA and JA key biosynthetic genes ZmNCED3 and ZmLOX8. 
    Upon drought stress, zmhsf28 plants exhibit weaker tolerance than the WT plants with slower stomatal closure and more reactive oxygen species accumulation. ZmHsf28 interacted with ZmSnRK2.2 physically, resulting in phosphorylation at Ser220, which enhances binding to the heat shock elements of ZmNECD3 and ZmLOX8 promoters and subsequent gene expression. Meanwhile, ZmMYC2 upregulates ZmHsf28 gene expression through acting on the G-box of its promoter. Besides, ZmJAZ14/17 competitively interact with ZmHsf28 to interfere with protein interaction between ZmHsf28 and ZmSnRK2.2, blocking ZmHsf28 phosphorylation and impairing downstream gene regulation. 
    The ZmSnRK2.2-ZmHsf28-ZmJAZ14/17 module is identified to regulate drought tolerance through coordinating ABA and JA signaling, providing the insights for breeding to improve drought resistance in maize."
39688507,nitrogen use efficiency,Increasing Rubisco as a simple means to enhance photosynthesis and productivity now without lowering nitrogen use efficiency.,"Global demand for food may rise by 60% mid-century. A central challenge is to meet this need using less land in a changing climate. Nearly all crop carbon is assimilated through Rubisco, which is catalytically slow, reactive with oxygen, and a major component of leaf nitrogen. Developing more efficient forms of Rubisco, or engineering CO2 concentrating mechanisms into C3 crops to competitively repress oxygenation, are major endeavors, which could hugely increase photosynthetic productivity (≥ 60%). New technologies are bringing this closer, but improvements remain in the discovery phase and have not been reduced to practice. A simpler shorter-term strategy that could fill this time gap, but with smaller productivity increases (c. 10%) is to increase leaf Rubisco content. This has been demonstrated in initial field trials, improving the productivity of C3 and C4 crops. Combining three-dimensional leaf canopies with metabolic models infers that a 20% increase in Rubisco increases canopy photosynthesis by 14% in sugarcane (C4) and 9% in soybean (C3). This is consistent with observed productivity increases in rice, maize, sorghum and sugarcane. Upregulation of Rubisco is calculated not to require more nitrogen per unit yield and although achieved transgenically to date, might be achieved using gene editing to produce transgene-free gain of function mutations or using breeding."
39699665,osmotic stress response; response to heat stress,Functional crosstalk of sucrose and G protein signaling in maize thermotolerance by modulating osmoregulation system.,"Sucrose (SUC) is a signaling molecule with multiple physiological functions. G protein is a kind of receptor that converts extracellular first messenger into intracellular second messenger. However, it is little known that SUC interplays with G protein signaling in maize thermotolerance. In this work, using maize seedlings as materials, the interplay between SUC and G protein signaling in maize thermotolerance was investigated. The results indicate that heat stress-decreased survival percentage and tissue viability of the seedlings was mitigated by SUC. Similarly, heat stress-increased malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage also was reduced by SUC. These findings show that SUC can potentially enhance thermotolerance in maize seedlings. Also, SUC-enhanced thermotolerance was abolished by suramin (G protein inhibitor) and N-ethylmaleimide (SUC transport inhibitor), but enhanced by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (G protein activator), indicating the interplay of SUC and G protein signaling in maize thermotolerance. To investigate the possible mechanism behind SUC-G protein interaction in enhancing maize thermotolerance, osmoregulation in mesocotyls of seedlings were evaluated before and after heat stress. The results suggest that osmolytes (SUC, glucose, fructose, total soluble sugar, proline, and glycine betaine) contents in mesocotyls under non-heat and heat stress were increased by SUC in varying degrees. Likewise, the osmolyte-metabolizing enzymes (sucrose-phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase, ornithine aminotransferase, betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase, and trehalase) activities were enhanced by SUC. Analogously, ZmSPS1, ZmSUS6, ZmP5CS, ZmOAT, ZmBADH, and ZmTRE1 expression in mesocotyls was up-regulated by SUC to different extent. These findings illustrate that the functional crosstalk of sucrose and G protein signaling in maize thermotolerance by modulating osmoregulation system."
39699908,ear morphology,Genetic dissection of ear-related trait divergence between maize and teosinte.,"Maize has undergone remarkable domestication and shows striking differences in architecture and ear morphology compared to its wild progenitor, called teosinte. However, our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the ear morphology differences between teosinte and cultivated maize is still limited. In this study, we explored the genetic basis of ear-related traits at both early and mature stages by analyzing a population derived from a cross between Mo17 and a teosinte line, mexicana. We identified 31 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with four IM-related and four ear-related traits, with 27 QTLs subjected to selection during the domestication process. Several key genes related to ear development were found under selection, including KN1 and RA1. Analysis of gene expression in the IM of developing ears from the population revealed the prominent roles of cis-variants in gene regulation. We also identified a large number of trans-eQTLs responsible for gene expression variation, and enrichment analysis on a trans-eQTL hotspot revealed the possible involvement of the sulfur metabolic pathway in controlling ear traits. Integrating the expression and phenotypic mapping data, we pinpointed several candidate genes potentially influencing ear development. Our findings advance the understanding of the genetic basis driving ear trait variation during maize domestication."
39700336,response to Gibberella ear rot,Comparative Review of Fusarium graminearum Infection in Maize and Wheat: Similarities in Resistance Mechanisms and Future Directions.,"Fusarium graminearum is one of the most important plant-pathogenic fungi that causes disease on wheat and maize, as it decreases yield in both crops and produces mycotoxins that pose a risk to human and animal health. Resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat is well studied and documented. However, resistance to Gibberella ear rot (GER) in maize is less understood, despite several similarities with FHB. In this review, we synthesize existing literature on the colonization strategies, toxin accumulation, genetic architecture and potential mechanisms of resistance to GER in maize and compare it to what is known regarding FHB in wheat. There are several similarities in the infection and colonization strategies of F. graminearum in maize and wheat. We describe multiple types of GER resistance in maize and identify distinct genetic regions for each resistance type. We discuss the potential of phenylpropanoids for biochemical resistance to F. graminearum. Phenylpropanoids are well characterized, and there are many similarities in their functional roles for resistance between wheat and maize. These insights can be utilized to improve maize germplasm for GER resistance and are also useful for FHB resistance breeding and management."
39701501,response to cold stress,Tissue-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in maize cold stress response,"Maize, a vital crop globally, faces significant yield losses due to its sensitivity to cold stress, especially in temperate regions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing maize response to cold stress is crucial for developing strategies to enhance cold tolerance. However, the precise chromatin-level regulatory mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. In this study, we employed DNase-seq and RNA-seq techniques to investigate chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in maize root, stem, and leaf tissues subjected to cold treatment. We discovered widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression across these tissues, with strong tissue specificity. Cold stress-induced DNase I hypersensitive sites (coiDHSs) were associated with differentially expressed genes, suggesting a direct link between chromatin accessibility and gene regulation under cold stress. Motif enrichment analysis identified ERF transcription factors (TFs) as central regulators conserved across tissues, with ERF5 emerging as pivotal in the cold response regulatory network. Additionally, TF co-localization analysis highlighted six TF pairs (ERF115-SHN3, ERF9-LEP, ERF7-SHN3, LEP-SHN3, LOB-SHN3, and AS2-LOB) conserved across tissues but showing tissue-specific binding preferences. These findings indicate intricate regulatory networks in maize cold response. Overall, our study provides insights into the chromatin-level regulatory mechanisms underpinning maize adaptive response to cold stress, offering potential targets for enhancing cold tolerance in agricultural contexts. 
Highlights: 
    •    Chromatin accessibility and gene expression under cold stress exhibit tissue specificity in maize. 
    •    Cold-induced DNase I hypersensitive sites (coiDHSs) are closely linked to differential gene expression. 
    •    ERF transcription factors, particularly ERF5, are pivotal regulators in maize cold stress response. 
    •    TF co-localization analysis reveals conserved TF pairs driving regulatory networks."
39701983,drought response,Functional study of ZmHDZ4 in maize (Zea mays) seedlings under drought stress.,"Background: Maize is a major feed and industrial crop and pivotal for ensuring global food security. In light of global warming and climate change, improving maize tolerance to water deficit is crucial. Identification and functional analysis of drought tolerance genes have potential practical importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of drought stress. 

Results: Here, we identified a maize Homeodomain-Leucine Zipper I, ZmHDZ4, in maize seedlings that is associated with drought tolerance. We demonstrated that ZmHDZ4 has transcriptional activation activity, exclusively localized in the nucleus. Several Cis-acting elements associated with abiotic stress have been identified in the core promoter region of ZmHDZ4. Under drought-stressed conditions, transgenic maize plants overexpressing ZmHDZ4 exhibited significantly higher relative water content and peroxidase (POD) and superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activities compared to wide-type plants, while displaying lower malondialdehyde (MAD) content. The expressions of ZmMFS1-88, ZmGPM573, and ZmPHD9 were significantly repressed in the ZmHDZ4-OE plants under drought-stressed conditions, indicating that ZmMFS1-88, ZmGPM573, and ZmPHD9 were the candidate target genes of ZmHDZ4. 

Conclusions: ZmHDZ4 is involved in the regulation of drought stress tolerance in maize by participating in osmotic regulation, sugar metabolism pathways, and hormone regulation."
39707963,response to maize weevil,Volatile Byproducts of Carotenoid Degradation as Biomarkers of Maize Infestation by the Maize Weevil (<i>Sitophilus zeamais</i>) (Motsch.),"Maize (Zea mays) is a major global food crop and a source of industrial raw materials. Effective postharvest storage is important for national food security programs, international trade, and global agriculture economics. The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) is a primary postharvest insect pest that infests maize during storage and leads to significant losses. Using multivariate discriminant analysis of volatile profiles collected from intact and infested maize, we identified two volatile apocarotenoids, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol, as indicators of maize weevil infestation in stored maize. Emission of these biomarker compounds rapidly signaled maize weevil infestation and showed a significant correlation with oviposition damage to the stored kernels. The pattern of elevated biomarker emission after weevil exposure was consistent across all seven maize lines examined. These volatile biomarkers can be used for early detection and removal of infested maize and can aid in the control of this pest."
39708228,baby corn yield,Silkless1 gene in maize: development and validation of the gene-based markers for breeding silkless baby corn.,"Background: The role of the silkless1 (sk1) gene in developing silkless baby corn, a distinctive trait in maize has been investigated. So far, no sk1 gene-specific marker has been available for accelerated development of silkless baby corn hybrids. 

Methods & results: We developed sk1 gene-based markers and validated them in backcross (BC) and F2 segregating generations, revealing a polymorphic marker corresponding to a silkless phenotype. Among all the developed markers, the MGU_sk1-1 marker (141 bp size in sk1-mutant allele) validated its association with the silkless trait. The chi square (χ2) analysis revealed that the segregation of alleles Sk1Sk1 (219): Sk1sk1 (414): sk1sk1 (188) is as per the Mendelian ratio (1:2:1) in the F2 population. In 821 F2 plants, we found a 3:1 phenotypic ratio among the population with silked (633) and silkless (188) plants. We studied 349 BC plants and found a 1:1 phenotypic ratio between silked and silkless plants, as well as a genotypic ratio (1:1) between heterozygotes (Sk1sk1) and homozygous recessives (sk1sk1). Additionally, double mutants (sk1sk1/ts1ts1 and sk1sk1/ts2ts2) were identified using the sk1-based marker. 

Conclusions: This study is the first to show the practical use of sk1 gene in marker-assisted selection (MAS). This research also reports the development of novel genetic resources for innovative silkless baby corn breeding."
39709339,response to deep sowing,Enhanced antioxidant activity improves deep-sowing tolerance in maize.,"Background: Deep sowing has emerged as a vital agricultural strategy, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, as it allows seeds to access water stored in deeper soil layers. This approach facilitates successful germination and establishment of crops, even in challenging environmental conditions. Previous studies have shown that the length of the maize mesocotyl is an important trait influencing deep-sowing tolerance. Several factors play a crucial role in regulating mesocotyl elongation, primarily including light, hormones, metabolites, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, further understanding the regulatory mechanisms of mesocotyl elongation is essential for enhancing maize germination and growth under deep sowing conditions. 

Results: In this study, we identified a deep sowing-tolerant inbred line, DH65232, which showed significantly increased mesocotyl length compared to B73 under deep sowing conditions. Transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes in the mesocotyl of the two inbred lines were mainly enriched in three pathways: hormone regulation, intermediate metabolites, and redox enzymes. Measurements of hormone content and phenotypic analysis following GA3 treatment indicated that GA3 plays a positive role in promoting mesocotyl elongation under deep-sowing stress in the inbred line DH65232. Additionally, untargeted metabolomics revealed that DH65232 exhibited a higher number of differential metabolites related to antioxidant pathway under deep-sowing stress compared to normal sowing. In deep sowing conditions, the determination of POD, CAT, SOD activities, and MDA content in the mesocotyl of B73 and DH65232 shows that DH65232 has a stronger ability to scavenge ROS. 

Conclusions: Above all, the inbred line DH65232 exhibits a greater tolerance to deep sowing due to its stronger antioxidant activity. Our study has contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex tolerance mechanisms in maize and provided new insights for the development of new maize varieties under deep sowing conditions."
39710150,ear morphology; kernel row number,Review： Recent advances in unraveling the genetic architecture of kernel row number in maize.,"Kernel row number (KRN) is an important trait in maize that significantly impacts maize yield. The high heritability of KRN underscores its significance in maize breeding programs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation, differentiation, and regulation of KRN in maize. Specifically, we have discussed gene mapping studies, functional validation of KRN-associated genes, and the application of gene editing techniques to KRN in maize. We summarized the various methods used to map and fine-map QTLs controlling KRN and provide an overview of the current status of cloned KRN-regulating genes. Despite the identification of many genes associated with KRN, the complexity of its regulation-arising from multiple loci and intricate gene interactions-remains a challenge. Balancing KRN with kernel number per row (KNR) and kernel weight is critical for optimizing yield while ensuring stability across different environments. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of environmental factors on KRN, noting that despite its high heritability, environmental conditions can significantly affect this trait. Combining genotype-phenotype relationships with environmental data using big data and artificial intelligence could enhance maize breeding efficiency and accelerate genetic gains. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing traits, integrating environmental factors, and leveraging advanced technologies in maize breeding to achieve optimal yield and stress tolerance. Finally, we outlined future research perspectives aimed at developing high-yielding maize varieties through advances in KRN-related research. 
Highlights: 
    •    Genetic control of kernel row number elucidated. 
    •    Key regulators and signaling pathways identified of the kernel row number. 
    •    Potential for targeted genetic improvement in the kernel row number 
    •    Phenotypes interact with each other to influence the kernel row number. 
    •    Environmental factors' impact explored of the kernel row number."
39711175,response to cold stress,Embracing native diversity to enhance the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II in maize.,"The sustainability of maize cultivation would benefit tremendously from early sowing, but is hampered by low temperatures during early development in temperate climates. We show that allelic variation within the gene encoding subunit M of the NADH-dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex (ndhm1) in a European maize landrace affects several quantitative traits that are relevant during early development in cold climates through NDH-mediated cyclic electron transport (CET) around photosystem I, a process crucial for photosynthesis and photoprotection. Beginning with a genome-wide association study for maximum potential quantum yield of photosystem II in dark-adapted leaves (Fv/Fm), we capitalized on the large phenotypic effects of a hAT transposon insertion in ndhm1 on multiple quantitative traits (early plant height, Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, and cold tolerance) caused by the reduced protein levels of NDHM and associated NDH components. Analysis of the ndhm1 native allelic series revealed a rare allele of ndhm1 that is associated with small albeit significant improvements of Fv/Fm, photosystem II efficiency in light-adapted leaves (ΦPSII), and early plant height compared to common alleles. Our work showcases the extraction of favorable alleles from locally adapted landraces, offering an efficient strategy for broadening the genetic variation of elite germplasm by breeding or genome editing."
39713342,response to climate change,Maladaptation in cereal crop landraces following a soot-producing climate catastrophe.,"Aerosol-producing global catastrophes such as nuclear war, super-volcano eruption, or asteroid strike, although rare, pose a serious threat to human survival. Light-absorbing aerosols would sharply reduce temperature and solar radiation reaching the earth's surface, decreasing crop productivity including for locally adapted traditional crop varieties, i.e. landraces. Here, we test post-catastrophic climate impacts on barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, four crops with extensive landrace cultivation, under a range of nuclear war scenarios that differ in the amount of soot injected into the climate model. We used a crop growth model to estimate gradients of environmental stressors that drive local adaptation. We then fit genotype environment associations using high density genomic markers with gradient forest offset (GF offset) methods and predicted maladaptation through time. As a validation, we found that our GF models successfully predicted local adaptation of maize landraces in multiple common gardens across Mexico. We found strong concordance between GF offset and disruptions in climate, and landraces were predicted to be the most maladapted across space and time where soot-induced climate change was the greatest. We further used our GF models to identify landrace varieties best matched to specific post-catastrophic conditions, indicating potential substitutions for agricultural resilience. We found the best landrace genotype was often far away or in another nation, though countries with more climatic diversity had better within-country substitutions. Our results highlight that a soot-producing catastrophe would result in the global maladaptation of landraces and suggest that current landrace adaptive diversity is insufficient for agricultural resilience in the case of the scenarios with the greatest change to climate."
39718137,response to salt,"ZmNF-YB10, a maize NF-Y transcription factor, positively regulates drought and salt stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major food and feed crop and an important raw material for energy, chemicals, and livestock. The NF-Y family of transcription factors in maize plays a crucial role in the regulation of plant development and response to environmental stress. In this study, we successfully cloned and characterized the maize NF-Y transcription factor gene ZmNF-YB10. We used bioinformatics, quantitative fluorescence PCR, and other techniques to analyze the basic properties of the gene, its tissue expression specificity, and its role in response to drought, salt, and other stresses. The results indicated that the gene was 1209 base pairs (bp) in length, with a coding sequence (CDS) region of 618 bp, encoding a polypeptide composed of 205 amino acid residues. This polypeptide has a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.85 and features a conserved structural domain unique to the NF-Y family. Quantitative fluorescence PCR results demonstrated that the ZmNF-YB10 gene was differentially upregulated under drought and salt stress treatments but exhibited a negatively regulated expression pattern under alkali and cold stress treatments. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana subjected to drought and salt stress in soil showed greener leaves than wild-type A. thaliana. In addition, the overexpression lines showed reduced levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2-), and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Western blot analysis revealed a distinct band at 21.8 kDa. Salt and drought tolerance analyses conducted in E. coli BL21 indicated a positive regulation. In yeast cells, ZmNF-YB10 exhibited a biological function that enhances salt and drought tolerance. Protein interactions were observed among the ZmNF-YB10, ZmNF-YC2, and ZmNF-YC4 genes. It is hypothesized that the ZmNF-YB10, ZmNF-YC2, and ZmNF-YC4 genes may play a role in the response to abiotic stresses, such as drought and salt tolerance, in maize."
39719935,drought response; response to heat stress,Enhancing maize drought and heat tolerance: single vs combined plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation.,"Maize (Zea mays L.), a key staple crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, is particularly vulnerable to concurrent drought and heat stress, which threatens crop yield and food security. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have shown potential as biofertilizers to enhance plant resilience under such abiotic stresses. This study aimed to (1) identify PGPR isolates tolerant to drought and heat, (2) assess their capacity to mitigate the effects of these stresses on early maize growth, and (3) analyze maize gene expression changes associated with PGPR-induced tolerance. Rhizobacteria were isolated and screened for drought and heat tolerance, alongside key plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits, including phosphorus solubilization, nitrogen fixation, and indole acetic acid production. In vitro and pot trials evaluated the effects of selected isolates on maize growth under stress, using indicators such as shoot length, root and shoot biomass (wet and dry), and leaf water content. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to profile maize stress response genes. The identified PGPR isolates included Bacillus cereus (11MN1), Bacillus pseudomycoides (21MN1B), Lelliottia amnigena (33MP1), and Leclercia adecarboxylata (36MP8). Greenhouse trials demonstrated that L. amnigena 33MP1, L. adecarboxylata 36MP8, and a mixed culture of isolates (11MN1, 21MN1B, 33MP1, 36MP8) effectively alleviated the adverse effects of concurrent drought and heat stress in maize. Notably, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that PGPR-induced tolerance may involve the modulation of stress response genes CAT2 (catalase 2) and DHN2 (dehydrin 2), which play roles in oxidative stress management and cellular protection. The PGPR isolates identified in this study represent promising bioinoculants for enhancing maize resilience under climate-induced stresses, offering a sustainable approach to improve maize productivity, conserve water, and reduce irrigation needs in drought-prone regions."
39725006,seed vigor; germination index,Non-destructive detection strategy of maize seed vigor based on seed phenotyping and the potential for accelerating breeding,"Introduction: 
Seeds are fundamental to agricultural production, and their vigor affects seedling quality, quantity, and crop yield. Accurate vigor assessment methods are crucial for agricultural productivity. 
Objectives: 
Traditional seed vigor testing and phenotypic trait acquisition methods are complex, time-consuming, or destructive. Thus, this study aims to develop a non-destructive method for assessing maize seed vigor based on seed phenotyping and to delve into the underlying mechanism of this method. 
Methods: 
Utilizing 368 maize inbred lines with diverse genetic backgrounds as research material, the cold-soaking germination percentage, closely related to the field emergence percentage, was selected to evaluate seed vigor. High and low-vigor groups were ultimately obtained through mixed grouping based on the consistent performance of seeds harvested across years. Subsequently, non-destructive techniques such as hyperspectral imaging, machine vision, and gas chromatography with ion mobility spectrometry, along with machine learning, were employed to establish models for distinguishing high and low-vigor maize seeds in their natural state. After determining the optimal strategy, key phenotypic features were identified for relevant genetic and metabolic analyses to elucidate the effectiveness of the seed vigor testing model. 
Results: 
Among the evaluated methods, the machine vision-based emerged as the optimal seed vigor detection method (accuracy ≈ 90%). Subsequently, four key features (B_mean, b_mean, S_mean, and b_std) were selected for genome-wide association analysis, revealing two confident candidate genes involved in hormone regulation affecting seed germination. Further investigations confirmed significant differences in several endogenous hormones’ levels and flavonoid, chlorophyll, and anthocyanidin content between high and low-vigor maize seeds. 
Conclusion: 
This study validates a reliable, non-destructive seed vigor detection model supported by genetic and physiological-biochemical evidence. The findings enhance the application of non-destructive seed quality testing models and provide reliable and high-throughput measurable phenotypic traits associated with seed vigor, thereby facilitating gene mining and accelerating high-vigor maize variety breeding. 
Highlights: 
    •    Developed cost-effective maize seed vigor testing method based on machine vision. 
    •    Screened reliable seed vigor-related features, B_mean, b_mean, S_mean, and b_std. 
    •    Genome-wide association analysis to identify genes associated with key features. 
    •    Metabolite analysis according to the function of confident candidate genes. 
    •    Confirmed the reliability of the seed vigor detection model by genetic evidence."
39725188,response to salt,ZmGolS1 underlies natural variation of raffinose content and salt tolerance in maize,"Salt stress significantly inhibits crop growth and development, and mitigating this can enhance salt tolerance in various crops. Previous studies have shown that regulating saccharide biosynthesis is a key aspect of plant salt tolerance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of a salt-inducible galactinol synthase gene, ZmGolS1, alleviates salt-induced growth inhibition, likely by promoting raffinose synthesis. Additionally, we show that natural variation in ZmGolS1 transcript levels contributes to the diversity of raffinose content and salt tolerance in maize. We further reveal that ZmRR18, a type-B response regulator transcription factor, binds to the AATC element in the promoter of ZmGolS1, with this binding increases the transcript levels of ZmGolS1 under salt conditions. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism (termed SNP-302T) within the ZmGolS1 promoter significantly reduces its binding affinity for ZmRR18, resulting in decreased ZmGolS1 expression and diminished raffinose content, ultimately leading to a salt-hypersensitive phenotype. Collectively, our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms by which the ZmRR18-ZmGolS1 module enhances raffinose biosynthesis, thereby promoting maize growth under salt conditions. This research provides important insights into salt tolerance mechanisms associated with saccharide biosynthesis and identifies valuable genetic loci for breeding salt-tolerant maize varieties."
39731983,response to cold stress; germination index,Thriving in adversity: understanding how maize seeds respond to the challenge of combined cold and high humidity stress,"Extreme conditions, such as cold and high humidity in northeast China’s high-latitude maize region, can hinder crop yield and stability during the vegetative stage. However, there is a paucity of research examining the effects of simultaneous cold and high humidity stress on plant responses. In this study, we characterized the acclimation of JD558 (cold- and high humidity- sensitive hybrid) and JD441 (cold- and high humidity- tolerant hybrid) to stress at sowing caused by cold (4°C), high humidity (25%), and their combined stress for five days, using physiological measurements and metabolomics during the stress treatments and recovery stages. Cold, high humidity, and their combined stress prolonged seed development and restricted material transport, with high humidity harming seed survival more than cold. Combined stress exhibited a more significant inhibitory effect on growth than individual stress. Individual and combined stress reduced α-amylase activity, disrupted antioxidants levels, increased malondialdehyde content, disturbed the oxidative balance within seeds, and impeded seed growth and development. Most carboxylic acids and their derivatives were downregulated caused by combined stress. In JD558, sucrose, D-glucose, glucose-1-phosphate, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate were downregulated, while these metabolites were upregulated in JD441, leading to a blockage of glycolysis in JD558. After eliminating stress, JD441 showed greater α-amylase activity and a smaller decrease in MDA levels, resulting in a smaller reduction in root growth and transport rate than JD558. In summary, the different responses of the cold and high humidity sensitive hybrid and the tolerant hybrid to combined stress are related to the recovery ability after stress elimination. 
Highlights: 
    •    Combined cold and humidity stress decreases α-amylase activity, disrupts antioxidant balance, and hinders seed development and transport. 
    •    High humidity negatively impacts seed survival more than cold stress. 
    •    Combined stress has a more significant effect on seed growth process than individual stress. 
    •    Metabolomic profiles reveal different responses to combined stress in JD558 and JD441. 
    •    JD441 recovers more effectively from combined cold and humidity stress."
39734200,response to Aspergillus fumigatus; response to salt,Biopriming of Maize with their endophyte Aspergillus fumigatus reinforces their resistance to salinity stress and improves their physiological traits.,"Zea mays L. (Maize) is one of the most crucial world's crops, for their nutritional values, however, the water scarcity and consequent soil salinization are the major challenges that limit the growth and productivity of this plant, particularly in the semi-arid regions in Egypt. Recently, biopriming has been recognized as one of the most efficient natural-ecofriendly approaches to mitigate the abiotic salt stress on plants. The haploid (128) and triploid (368) seeds of maize were selected as model verities for assessing their resistance to salt stress and mitigating their effect by fungal-biopriming. Overall, the haploid and triploid plants viabilities were drastically affected by salt concentration, at 500 mM of NaCl. At 500 mM NaCl, the fresh weights of the triploid and haploid seedlings were reduced by ~ 5 and 6.1 folds, compared to the controls, ensuring slightly higher salt resistance of the triploid than haploid ones. The pattern of the endophytic fugal isolates was plausibly changed with the salt concentration for both plant types, Aspergillus fumigatus isolate was emerged with the higher NaCl concentration (400-500 mM), and their morphological identity was molecularly confirmed and deposited into Genbank with accession # PQ200673. The fungal bioprimed seeds of the haploid and triploid plants were irrigated with 400 mM NaCl. The fungal-bioprimed plants displayed a significant improvement on the shoot density, fibrous roots, root length, shoot length, and leaves numbers and areas of the stressed-plants by ~ 1.7 folds, compared to control, ensures the triggering of different salt resistance machineries in plants upon fungal biopriming. The total antioxidant enzymes activities ""catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase"" of the salt-stressed bioprimed maize plants were increased by ~ 4.7-5.3%, compared to control, confirming the mitigating effect of the salinity stress on plants upon fungal biopriming. The chlorophyll and carotenoids contents were significantly increased of the salt stressed maize upon biopriming with A. fumigatus. The expression of the sod, apx2, nhx11, hkt1, H + -PPase, nced of the plant salt stressed was strongly increased in response to A. fumigatus biopriming, normalized to β-actin gene. The expression of apx2 was dramatically increased by about 30 and 43 folds, in response to fungal biopriming. The nhx1 was significantly up-regulated by 18.9 fold in response to fungal biopriming, compared to control."
39736427,mycorrhizal infection; salinity tolerance; response to high pH,ZmL75 is required for colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and for saline–alkali tolerance in maize,"Saline–alkali soil severely reduces the productivity of crops, including maize (Zea mays). Although several genes associated with saline–alkali tolerance have been identified in maize, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a direct link between colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and saline–alkali tolerance in maize. We identify s75, a natural maize mutant that cannot survive under moderate saline–alkali soil conditions or establish AM symbioses. The saline–alkali hypersensitive phenotype of s75 is caused by a 1,340-bp deletion in Zm00001d033915, designated as ZmL75. This gene encodes a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is responsible for AMF colonization. ZmL75 expression levels in roots correspond with the root length colonization (RLC) rate during early vegetative development. Notably, the s75 mutant line shows a complete loss of AMF colonization, along with alterations in the diversity and structure of its root fungal microbiota. Conversely, overexpression of ZmL75 increases the RLC rate and enhances tolerance to saline–alkali soil conditions. These results suggest that ZmL75 is required for symbiosis with AMF, which directly improves saline–alkali tolerance. Our findings provide insights into maize–AMF interactions and offer a potential strategy for maize improvement."
39738785,nuclear male sterility,Ms44-SPT: unique genetic technology simplifies and improves hybrid maize seed production in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Hybrid maize seed production in Africa is dependent upon manual detasseling of the female parental lines, often resulting in plant damage that can lead to reduced seed yields on those detasseled lines. Additionally, incomplete detasseling can result in hybrid purity issues that can lead to production fields being rejected. A unique nuclear genetic male sterility seed production technology, referred to as Ms44-SPT, was developed to avoid hybrid seed loss and to improve the purity and quality of hybrid maize production. Hybrid seed yield reduction following detasseling can be attributed to leaf loss. Our analyses showed an average 2.9 leaves are lost during the detasseling process, resulting in a seed yield reduction of 14.0%. These findings suggest that deploying the Ms44-SPT technology would avoid this seed yield loss. By simplifying hybrid production and increasing seed yields, Ms44-SPT could help drive hybrid replacement, providing smallholder farmers with better access to improved hybrids."
39741666,anthesis date,Disentangling genotype and environment specific latent features for improved trait prediction using a compositional autoencoder.,"In plant breeding and genetics, predictive models traditionally rely on compact representations of high-dimensional data, often using methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and, more recently, Autoencoders (AE). However, these methods do not separate genotype-specific and environment-specific features, limiting their ability to accurately predict traits influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. We hypothesize that disentangling these representations into genotype-specific and environment-specific components can enhance predictive models. To test this, we developed a compositional autoencoder (CAE) that decomposes high-dimensional data into distinct genotype-specific and environment-specific latent features. Our CAE framework employed a hierarchical architecture within an autoencoder to effectively separate these entangled latent features. Applied to a maize diversity panel dataset, the CAE demonstrated superior modeling of environmental influences and out-performs PCA (principal component analysis), PLSR (Partial Least square regression) and vanilla autoencoders by 7 times for 'Days to Pollen' trait and 10 times improved predictive performance for 'Yield'. By disentangling latent features, the CAE provided a powerful tool for precision breeding and genetic research. This work has significantly enhanced trait prediction models, advancing agricultural and biological sciences."
39747108,response to heat stress,Single-cell transcriptomes reveal spatiotemporal heat stress response in maize roots.,"Plant roots perceive heat stress (HS) and adapt their architecture accordingly, which in turn influence the yield in crops. Investigating their heterogeneity and cell type-specific response to HS is essential for improving crop resilience. Here, we generate single-cell transcriptional landscape of maize (Zea mays) roots in response to HS. We characterize 15 cell clusters corresponding to 9 major cell types and identify cortex as the main root cell type responsive to HS with the most differentially expressed genes and its trajectory being preferentially affected upon HS. We find that cortex size strongly correlated with heat tolerance that is experimentally validated by using inbred lines and genetic mutation analysis of one candidate gene in maize, providing potential HS tolerance indicator and targets for crop improvement. Moreover, interspecies comparison reveals conserved root cell types and core markers in response to HS in plants, which are experimentally validated. These results provide a universal atlas for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain the cell identity of maize roots in response to HS at a cell type-specific level."
39754085,response to heat stress,Expression divergence of BAG gene family in maize under heat stress.,"Heat stress poses a significant challenge for maize production, especially during the spring when high temperatures disrupt cellular processes, impeding plant growth and development. The B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) associated athanogene (BAG) gene family is known to be relatively conserved across various species. It plays a crucial role as molecular chaperone cofactors that are responsible for programmed cell death and tumorigenesis. Once the plant is under heat stress, the BAG genes act as co-chaperones and modulate the molecular functions of HSP70/HSC70 saving the plant from the damage of high temperature stress. The study was planned to identify and characterize the BAG genes for heat stress responsiveness in maize. Twenty-one (21) BAG genes were identified in the latest maize genome. The evolutionary relationship of Zea mays BAGs (ZmBAGs) with Arabidopsis thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, Theobroma cacao, Sorghum bicolor, Ananas comosus, Physcomitrium patens, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa were represented by the phylogenetic analysis. Differential expressions of BAG gene family in leaf, endosperm, anther, silk, seed and developing embryo depict their contribution to the growth and development. The in-silico gene expression analysis indicated ZmBAG-8 (Zm00001eb170080), and ZmBAG-11 (Zm00001eb237960) showed higher expression under abiotic stresses (cold, heat and salinity). The RT-qPCR further confirmed the expression of ZmBAG-8 and ZmBAG-11 in plant leaf tissue across the contrasting inbred lines and their F1 hybrid (DR-139, UML-1 and DR-139 × UML-1) when exposed to heat stress. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction networks of ZmBAG-8 and ZmBAG-11 further elucidated their role in stress tolerance related pathways. This research offers a roadmap to plan functional research and utilize ZmBAG genes to enhance heat tolerance in grasses."
39754892,disease response,Detecting novel plant pathogen threats to food system security by integrating the Plant Reactome and remote sensing.,"Plant diseases constantly threaten crops and food systems, while global connectivity further increases the risks of spreading existing and exotic pathogens. Here, we first explore how an integrative approach involving plant pathway knowledgegraphs, differential gene expression data, and biochemical data informing Raman spectroscopy could be used to detect plant pathways responding to pathogen attacks. The Plant Reactome (https://plantreactome.gramene.org) demonstrates the potential to synthesize knowledgegraphs depicting plant-pathogen interactions, leveraging availability of publicly available OMIC data sets related to major diseases of rice and maize. Plant pathway signatures may then guide the development of drone and satellite remote-sensing methods for early monitoring of disease outbreaks across farms and landscapes. A review of current proximal- and remote-sensing technology demonstrates the potential for actionable early pathogen detection. We furthermore identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed for developing these tools as components of effective strategies for safeguarding global food security against current and emerging pathogens."
39757743,"husk width; protein content, kernel",Natural variation in ZmNRT2.5 modulates husk leaf width and promotes seed protein content in maize.,"The husk leaf of maize (Zea mays) encases the ear as a modified leaf and plays pivotal roles in protecting the ear from pathogen infection, translocating nutrition for grains and warranting grain yield. However, the natural genetic basis for variation in husk leaf width remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for maize husk leaf width and identified a 3-bp InDel (insertion/deletion) in the coding region of the nitrate transporter gene ZmNRT2.5. This polymorphism altered the interaction strength of ZmNRT2.5 with another transporter, ZmNPF5, thereby contributing to variation in husk leaf width. We also isolated loss-of-function mutants in ZmNRT2.5, which exhibited a substantial decrease in husk leaf width relative to their controls. We demonstrate that ZmNRT2.5 facilitates the transport of nitrate from husk leaves to maize kernels in plants grown under low-nitrogen conditions, contributing to the accumulation of proteins in maize seeds. Together, our findings uncovered a key gene controlling maize husk leaf width and nitrate transport from husk leaves to kernels. Identification of the ZmNRT2.5 loci offers direct targets for improving the protein content of maize seeds via molecular-assisted maize breeding."
39761526,environmental stress response,Take a Deep BReath: Manipulating brassinosteroid homeostasis helps cereals adapt to environmental stress.,"Global climate change leads to the increased occurrence of environmental stress (including drought and heat stress) during the vegetative and reproductive stages of cereal crop development. Thus, more attention should be given to developing new cereal cultivars with improved tolerance to environmental stress. However, during the development of new stress-tolerant cereal cultivars, the balance between improved stress responses (which occur at the expense of growth) and plant yield needs to be maintained. Thus, the urgent need for developing new cereal germplasm with improved stress tolerance could be fulfilled using semi-dwarf cereal mutants defective in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis or signaling. BRs are steroid phytohormones that regulate various developmental and physiological processes throughout the plant life cycle. Mutants defective in BR biosynthesis or responses show reduced plant height (dwarfism or semi-dwarfism). Importantly, numerous reports indicate that genetic modification or biotechnological manipulation of BR biosynthesis or signaling genes in cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), which are of crucial importance for global agriculture, may facilitate the development of cereal germplasm with improved stress tolerance. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the genetic manipulation of BR homeostasis in the above-mentioned cereal crops aimed at improving plant responses to various environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, oxidative stress, thermal stress, and biotic stresses. We highlight target BR-related genes and the effects of genetic manipulation (gene editing, overexpression, silencing or miRNA-mediated regulation) on plant adaptability to various stresses and provide future perspectives."
39763573,leaf rolling,Identification of the arl1 locus controlling leaf rolling and its application in maize breeding.,"Increasing planting density is one of the most important strategies for generating higher maize yields. Moderate leaf rolling decreases mutual shading of leaves and increases the photosynthesis of the population and hence increases the tolerance for high-density planting. Few genes that control leaf rolling in maize have been identified, however, and their applicability for breeding programs remains unclear. Here we identified a maize abaxially rolled leaf1 (arl1) mutant with extreme abaxially rolled leaves and found that the size of the bulliform cells within the adaxial leaf blade surface increased in the arl1 mutant. Bulk segregation analysis mapping in an F2 population derived from a single cross between arl1 and inbred line Gui18421 with normal leaves identified the arl1 locus on chromosome 2. Sequential fine-mapping delimited the arl1 locus to a 233.56-kb genomic interval containing three candidate genes. Sequence alignment between arl1 and Gui18421 identified an 8-bp insertion in the coding region of Zm00001eb082500, which led to a frame shift causing premature transcription termination in arl1 mutant. Meanwhile, both deep sequencing and Sanger sequencing showed that Zm00001eb082520 was present in Gui18421 but was absent in arl1. A pair of near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying the Gui18421 allele (NILGui18421) and the arl1 allele (NIL arl1 ) were developed, and the leaves of NIL arl1 plants had greater light transmission and photosynthetic rate in the middle and lower canopy than did those of NILGui18421 plants under high-density planting. Furthermore, NIL arl1 had a higher seed setting rate, more kernels per ear, and an increased kernel weight per ear than NILGui18421, and the grain yield of NIL arl1 was not affected as the planting density increased, suggesting that the arl1 locus can be used for genetic improvement of high-density planting tolerance. Taken together, the identification of arl1 and evaluation of yield-related traits for NILGui18421 and NIL arl1 provide an excellent target for future maize improvement."
39792927,drought response,metaGE: Investigating genotype x environment interactions through GWAS meta-analysis.,"Elucidating the genetic components of plant genotype-by-environment interactions is of key importance in the context of increasing climatic instability, diversification of agricultural practices and pest pressure due to phytosanitary treatment limitations. The genotypic response to environmental stresses can be investigated through multi-environment trials (METs). However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of MET data are significantly more complex than that of single environments. In this context, we introduce metaGE, a flexible and computationally efficient meta-analysis approach for jointly analyzing single-environment GWAS of any MET experiment. The metaGE procedure accounts for the heterogeneity of quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects across the environmental conditions and allows the detection of QTL whose allelic effect variations are strongly correlated to environmental cofactors. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology and compared it to two competing procedures through simulations. We also applied metaGE to two emblematic examples: the detection of flowering QTLs whose effects are modulated by competition in Arabidopsis and the detection of yield QTLs impacted by drought stresses in maize. The procedure identified known and new QTLs, providing valuable insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and QTL effects dependent on environmental stress conditions. The whole statistical approach is available as an R package. 

Author summary: 

In multi-environment trial experiments, the same panel of plants is evaluated in different well-characterized sites and years to describe the genotypic response to environmental stresses. Such experiments require dedicated statistical approaches to allow the identification of quantitative trait locus (QTLs) whose allelic effects are modulated by the stress conditions. We consider an original approach based on the joint analysis of summary results from genome-wide association studies conducted separately in individual environments. Application of the method to Arabidopsis identified QTLs involved in flowering whose effects are strongly modulated by competition. Application to maize identified yield QTLs whose effects strongly correlated with the heat stress level. The method called metaGE drastically reduced the computational burden of the analysis and is distributed as an R package."
39793806,drought response,miR166e/ZmATHB14 module contributes to drought tolerance in maize root,"MicroRNAs significantly influence abiotic stress responses. A species-conserved miRNA implicated in the response to abiotic stress is maize miR166. Therefore, it is unknown whether miR166e plays a role in maize roots' reaction to drought stress. According to this study, drought stress lowers the expression of the miR166e precursor. According to genetic data, miR166e knockdown (KO) improved drought tolerance, while miR166e overexpression decreased it. Additionally, 5’-RACE and double luciferase tests have identified ZmATHB14, an HD-Zip III transcription factor, as a target of miR166e. Under drought stress, KO-miR166e alters ZmATHB14 expression and exhibits the opposite properties of miR166e. ZmATHB14 positively regulates the tolerance to drought stress. Furthermore, ZmATHB14, linked to the GTAATGATTAC cis-element, can activate transcription within the nucleus. Under drought stress, miR166e and ZmATHB14 contribute to vascular development and control ROS homeostasis. We discovered through metabolic targeting tests (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, HPLC-MS) that ZmATHB14 modifies signaling pathways and hormone levels. Our findings strongly imply that the miR166e-ZmATHB14 module regulates drought tolerance."
39795271,drought response,"Identification of ZmSNAC06, a Maize NAC Family Transcription Factor with Multiple Transcripts Conferring Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis.","Drought is one of the most serious environmental stresses affecting crop production. NAC transcription factors play a crucial role in responding to various abiotic stresses in plants. Here, we identified a maize NAC transcription factor, ZmSNAC06, between drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive inbred lines through RNA-seq analysis and characterized its function in Arabidopsis. ZmSNAC06 had five transcripts, of which ZmSNAC06-T02 had a typical NAC domain, while ZmSNAC06-P02 was localized in the nucleus of maize protoplasts and had transactivation activity in yeasts. The expression of ZmSNAC06 in maize was induced by drought. The overexpression of ZmSNAC06-T02 in Arabidopsis resulted in hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) at the germination stage, and overexpression lines exhibited higher survival rates and higher antioxidant enzyme activities compared with the wild-type under drought stress. These results suggest that ZmSNAC06 acts as a positive regulator in drought tolerance and may be used to improve drought tolerance in crops."
39795297,kernel type,Identification of Maize Kernel Varieties Using LF-NMR Combined with Image Data: An Explainable Approach Based on Machine Learning.,"The precise identification of maize kernel varieties is essential for germplasm resource management, genetic diversity conservation, and the optimization of agricultural production. To address the need for rapid and non-destructive variety identification, this study developed a novel interpretable machine learning approach that integrates low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) with morphological image features through an optimized support vector machine (SVM) framework. First, LF-NMR signals were obtained from eleven maize kernel varieties, and ten key features were extracted from the transverse relaxation decay curves. Meanwhile, five image morphological features were selected using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. Before modeling, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the distribution features of the internal components for each maize variety. Subsequently, LF-NMR features and image morphological data were integrated to construct a classification model and the SVM hyperparameters were optimized using an improved differential evolution algorithm, achieving a final classification accuracy of 96.36%, which demonstrated strong robustness and precision. The model's interpretability was further enhanced using Shapley values, which revealed the contributions of key features such as Max Signal and Signal at Max Curvature to classification decisions. This study provides an innovative technical solution for the efficient identification of maize varieties, supports the refined management of germplasm resources, and lays a foundation for genetic improvement and agricultural applications."
39795339,response to Bipolaris maydis,A Zinc Polyphenolic Compound Increases Maize Resistance Against Infection by Bipolaris maydis.,"Maize leaf blight (MLB), caused by the fungus Bipolaris maydis, is an important disease affecting maize production. In order to minimize the use of fungicides in agriculture, nutrient-based resistance inducers may become a promising alternative to manage MLB. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of Semia® (zinc (20%) complexed with a plant-derived pool of polyphenols (10%)) to hamper the infection of maize leaves by B. maydis by analyzing their photosynthetic performance and carbohydrate and antioxidative metabolism, as well as the expression of defense-related genes. Plants were sprayed with water (control) or Semia® (referred to as induced resistance (IR) stimulus hereafter) and not inoculated or inoculated with B. maydis. The mycelial growth and conidium germination were significantly reduced by the IR stimulus in vitro. The MLB severity was significantly reduced by 76% for IR-stimulus-sprayed plants compared to plants from the control treatment. For infected and IR-stimulus-sprayed plants, the glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch concentrations were significantly higher compared to inoculated plants from the control treatment. The activity levels of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione reductase were significantly higher for the IR-stimulus-sprayed plants compared to plants from the control treatment. Less impairment on the photosynthetic apparatus (higher values for leaf gas exchange (rates of net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance to water vapor, and transpiration) and chlorophyll a fluorescence (variable-to-maximum Chl a fluorescence ratio, photochemical yield, and yield for dissipation by down-regulation) parameters)) along with a preserved pool of chlorophyll a+b and carotenoids were noticed for infected and IR-stimulus-sprayed plants compared to infected plants from the control treatment. The defense-related genes IGL, CHS02, PR1, PAL3, CHI, and GLU were strongly up-regulated in the leaves of IR-stimulus-sprayed and infected plants compared to infected plants from the control treatment. These findings highlight the potential of using this IR stimulus for MLB management."
39795399,response to climate change; carotenoid content,"Evaluating Maize Hybrids for Yield, Stress Tolerance, and Carotenoid Content: Insights into Breeding for Climate Resilience.","To ensure food and feed security, modern maize hybrids must not only perform well under changing climate conditions but also consistently achieve higher and stable yields, exhibit maximum tolerance to stress factors, and produce high quality grains. In a study conducted in 2022 and 2023, 50 maize hybrids were developed from crosses of five elite (highly productive) inbred lines and ten lines possessing favorable genes for carotenoid content. These hybrids were tested under particularly unfavorable conditions for maize cultivation. The aim was to identify which lines effectively transmit the desired traits to the offspring (general combining ability-GCA), and to identify superior hybrids in terms of productivity, adaptability, and quality (specific combining ability-SCA). The study revealed that total carotenoids ranged from 2.30 to 40.20 μg/g for the inbred lines and from 7.45 to 25.08 μg/g for hybrids. A wider distribution of values was observed in the inbred lines compared to the hybrids for key carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, and β-carotene. Among the hybrids, notable performers in yield, adaptability, and carotenoid content included E390×D302, A452×D302, and A447×D302. The paternal inbred line D302 exhibited a high general combining ability for yield (1446 kg ha-1) and, when crossed with several inbred lines, produced hybrids with enhanced yields and higher levels of zeaxanthin, lutein, and β-carotene, as well as improved unbroken plants percent."
39807520,response to virus,Meta-QTL analysis for mining of candidate genes and constitutive gene network development for viral disease resistance in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Viral diseases severely impact maize yields, with occurrences of maize viruses reported worldwide. Deployment of genetic resistance in a plant breeding program is a sustainable solution to minimize yield loss to viral diseases. The meta-QTL (MQTL) has demonstrated to be a promising approach to pinpoint the most robust QTL(s)/candidate gene(s) in the form of an overlapping or common genomic region identified through leveraging on different research studies that independently report genomic regions significantly associated with the target traits. Here, we employed an MQTL approach by targeting 39 independent research investigations aimed at genetic dissection of the resistance in maize against 14 viral diseases. We could project 27 % (53) of the total 196 QTLs onto the maize genome. Our analysis found a robust set of 14 MQTLs on chromosomes 1, 3 and 10 that explain significant proportion of the variations for resistance against 11 viral diseases. Marker trait associations (MTAs) identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence in support of the two MQTLs (MQTL3_2 and MQTL10_2) playing crucial roles in viral disease resistance (VDR) in maize. A total of 1,715 candidate genes underlie the identified MQTL regions, of which, we further examined the constitutively-expressed genes for their involvement in various metabolic pathways. The involvement of the identified genes in the antiviral resistance mechanism renders them a valuable genomic resource for allele mining and elucidating plant-virus interactions for maize research and breeding."
39810712,response to salt,"The natural variation in shoot Na+ content and salt tolerance in maize is attributed to various minor-effect variants, including an SNP located in the promoter of ZmHAK11.","In summary, we provide evidence that the diversity in shoot Na+ content and salt tolerance in maize is attributed to various minor-effect variants, including an SNP (SNP-1781) located in the ZmHAK11 promoter. In SNP-1781C lines, salt stress increases the transcript level of ZmHAK11, which then promotes the exclusion of Na+ from shoot tissue likely by mediating the removal of Na+ from the root xylem flow. In SNP-1781G lines, the salt induction of ZmHAK11 transcription is impaired, resulting in increased shoot Na+ content and sensitivity to salt stress. This study improves our understanding of the natural variation of maize salt tolerance and identifies new gene targets for the breeding of salt-tolerant maize cultivars."
39817590,response to African armyworm; leaf width; response to Spodoptera littoralis; leaf length,Leaf Size Determines Damage- and Herbivore-Induced Volatile Emissions in Maize.,"Stress-induced plant volatiles play an important role in mediating ecological interactions between plants and their environment. The timing and location of the inflicted damage is known to influence the quality and quantity of induced volatile emissions. However, how leaf characteristics and herbivore feeding behaviour interact to shape volatile emissions is not well understood. Using a high-throughput volatile profiling system with high temporal resolution, we examined how mechanical damage and herbivore feeding on different leaves shape plant-level volatile emission patterns in maize. We then tested feeding patterns and resulting consequences on volatile emissions with two generalist herbivores (Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera littoralis), and assessed whether feeding preferences are associated with enhanced herbivore performance. We found maize seedlings emit more volatiles when larger leaves are damaged. Larger leaves emitted more volatiles locally, which was the determining factor for higher plant-level emissions. Surprisingly, both S. exigua and S. littoralis preferentially consumed larger leaves, and thus maximize plant volatile emission without apparent growth benefits. Together, these findings provide an ecophysiological and behavioural mechanism for plant volatile emission patterns, with potentially important implications for volatile-mediated plant-environment interactions."
39819332,drought response,CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing of ZmPL1 gene improves tolerance to drought stress in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a widely grown food crop around the world. Drought stress seriously affects the growth and development process of plants and causes serious damage to maize yield. In the early stage, our research group conducted transcriptome sequencing analysis on the drought-resistant maize inbred line H8186 and screened out a gene with significantly down-regulated expression, Phylloplanin-like (ZmPL1). The ZmPL1 gee expression pattern was analyzed under various abiotic stresses, and the results showed that this gene was greatly affected by drought stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the protein was localized on the cell membrane. In order to verify the role of ZmPL1 in drought stress, we overexpressed ZmPL1 in yeast and found that the expression of ZmPL1 could significantly increase the drought sensitivity of yeast. Next, ZmPL1 transgenic plants were obtained by infecting maize callus using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Under drought stress, compared with overexpression lines, gene-edited lines had higher germination rate and seedling survival rate, lower accumulation of MDA, relative conductivity and ROS, higher antioxidant enzyme activity, and the expression levels of stress-related genes and ROS scavenging-related genes were significantly increased. Exogenous application of ABA to each lines under drought stress attenuated the damage caused by drought stress on ZmPL overexpressing plants. In summary, ZmPL1 negatively regulates drought tolerance in maize."
39829370,root development; drought response,"ZmHB53, a Maize Homeodomain-Leucine Zipper I Transcription Factor Family Gene, Contributes to Abscisic Acid Sensitivity and Confers Seedling Drought Tolerance by Promoting the Activity of ZmPYL4.","Plant-specific homeodomain-leucine zipper I (HD-Zip I) transcription factors (TFs) crucially regulate plant drought tolerance. However, their specific roles in maize (Zea mays L.) regulating drought tolerance remain largely unreported. Here, we screened a maize HD-Zip I TF family gene, ZmHB53, and clarified its role in drought stress. ZmHB53 overexpression maize plants exhibited sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), tolerant to polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000)-induced stress during germination, along with improved seedling drought resistance. Compared to the wild-type, ZmHB53 overexpression lines show higher water retention, biomass, and survival rates, and reduced water loss and stomatal size under drought, suggesting ZmHB53's role in drought adaptation. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq), yeast one hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and dual luciferase showed that ZmHB53 directly bound to and upregulated the expression of ABA receptor ZmPYL4. Meanwhile, transgenic plants overexpressing ZmPYL4 also exhibit ABA sensitivity and drought tolerance. The research results provide novel insights into the regulatory role of ZmHB53 and ZmPYL4 in enhancing maize's drought tolerance, establishing a foundation for future validation and potential application of ZmHB53 in strategies to improve maize resistance to drought."
39831348,plant height,CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing of Brachytic2 creates semi-dwarf mutant alleles for tailored maize breeding.,"In summary, our results demonstrate the universality and efficacy of combining the Br2-Cas9 cassette with the IMGE technology for generating allele series of Br2 for tailored improvement of PH in different genetic backgrounds to meet customer demands, and thus should greatly facilitating molecular breeding of lodging-resistant maize cultivars adapting to high-density planting."
39835885,days to flowering,CircZmMED16 delays plant flowering by negatively regulating starch content through its binding to ZmAPS1.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of head-to-tail closed RNA molecules, have been implicated in various aspects of plant development and stress responses through transcriptome sequencing; however, the precise functional roles of circRNAs in plants remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a highly expressed circular RNA, circZmMED16, derived from exon 8 of the mediator complex subunit 16 (ZmMED16) across different maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines using circRNA-seq analysis. This circRNA is predominantly expressed in maize tassels and functions in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of circZmMED16 resulted in increased expression of ZmMED16/AtMED16 and delayed flowering in both maize and Arabidopsis thaliana, compared with that in wild-type plants. In contrast, overexpression of the parent gene ZmMED16 did not alter the flowering time of transgenic plants in Arabidopsis, suggesting that circZmMED16 plays a specific role in regulating flowering, distinct from that of linear ZmMED16. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation of flowering time by circZmMED16, we performed RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase, RNA interference (RNAi), and ribonuclease protection assays (RPA). These results indicate that circZmMED16 interacts with small subunit 1 of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (APS1) mRNA in both maize and Arabidopsis. The knockdown of circZmMED16 increased the expression of ZmAPS1, whereas the overexpression of circZmMED16 led to the downregulation of ZmAPS1 RNA and protein. By affecting ZmAPS1 expression, circZmMED16 reduced ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) activity and led to delayed flowering. These results revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for circRNAs in flowering time and shed light on their functional and regulatory roles in plants."
39842169,disease response; phosphorus uptake,"Efficacy of molecularly diversified phosphorus-solubilizing rhizobacterial isolates in phytostimulation, antimicrobial attributes and phosphorus-transporter genes mediated plant growth performance in maize (Zea mays L.).","This study evaluated a dual management approach to enhance plant-growth by improving soil fertility, reducing pathogenic stress using PGPR that affect phosphorus-transporter (pht) genes. Among 213 maize rhizobacterial isolates, 40 demonstrated the ability to solubilize tri-calcium phosphate, potassium, zinc, and silicon, showing various PGP traits. Nine of these isolates exhibited significant antagonistic activity against the plant pathogens Colletotrichum chlorophyti and Xanthomonas axonopodis. These pathogens cause root infection, reduces plant-immunity and growth. In pot experiments, these nine strains significantly improved root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, fresh weight, proline, APX, CAT, GR, NPK, and Zn content in maize plants after 60 days under pathogenic stress. Notably, PSB-25 increased root length by up to 66% under C. chlorophyti stress and 64% under X. axonopodis stress. PSB21 enhanced proline content by 49%, APX by 70%, and GR by 41%, while PSB-16 raised CAT activity by 55% under X. axonopodis stress. Molecular diversity analysis of the 40 PS-RB strains using ERIC, BOX, REP, and ARDRA showed two major clusters with Jaccard coefficients from 0.72 to 1.00. 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified PSB10, PSB16, and PSB25 as Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter sp., respectively. The effects of PSB10, PSB16, and PSB25 on growth parameters under pathogen stress were also studied. Field trials indicated that treatment T6 (100% RDF + PSB16) was most effective in promoting plant growth. Additionally, significant differences in the expression of six Pht1 transporter genes were noted between PS-RB treated and untreated maize seedlings, and these genes improving phosphorus acquisition."
39842436,response to cold stress,A natural variant of COOL1 gene enhances cold tolerance for high-latitude adaptation in maize,"Low temperature severely limits the growth, yield, and geographical distribution of maize (Zea mays L.). How maize adapts to cold climates remains largely unclear. Here, we identify a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, COLD-RESPONSIVE OPERATION LOCUS 1 (COOL1), as a crucial regulator of maize cold tolerance through genome-wide association studies. Natural variations in the COOL1 promoter affect the binding affinity of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), a transcriptional factor repressing COOL1 transcription. COOL1, in turn, negatively regulates downstream cold-responsive genes, thereby modulating cold tolerance. Moreover, calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK17 translocates to the nucleus and stabilizes COOL1 in response to cold stress. Intriguingly, the cold-tolerant allele of COOL1 is predominantly distributed in northern high latitudes with cold climates. This study defines a previously unknown pathway by which the COOL1-centered module regulates cold tolerance for high latitudinal adaptation in maize. 
Highlights: 
    •    COOL1 negatively regulates maize cold tolerance 
    •    Natural variations in COOL1 promoter lead to differential binding of HY5 
    •    Cold-activated CPK17 stabilizes COOL1 through phosphorylation 
    •    A COOL1 variant enhances maize adaptation to high-latitudinal regions"
39853254,response to plant population; root strength; root lodging,A tool to measure maize root system stiffness that enables a comprehensive understanding of plant mechanics and lodging.,"Plant mechanical failure, known as lodging, has detrimental impacts on the quality and quantity of maize yields. Failure can occur at stalks (stalk lodging) or at roots (root lodging). While previous research has focused on proxy measures for stalk stiffness, stalk strength, and root strength, there is a need to quantify the root system stiffness, which quantifies the force-displacement relationship. Here, we report a tool to quantify the root system stiffness of maize hybrids grown in different conditions. The results show that maize hybrids with a higher root system stiffness have a greater susceptibility to root lodging. This result is consistent with expected mechanical behavior, since higher root system stiffness values mean that the plant reaches the failure strength at lower displacements compared with a plant with lower root system stiffness. Collectively, this study describes the first tool to measure root system stiffness and enables a comprehensive understanding of the integrated plant mechanics and lodging."
39856590,"starch content, kernel",Novel candidate genes and genetic basis analysis of kernel starch content in tropical maize.,"Starch is the most abundant carbohydrate in maize grains, serving as a primary energy source for both humans and animals, and playing a crucial role in various industrial applications. Increasing the starch content of maize grains is beneficial for improving the grain yield and quality. To gain insight into the genetic basis of starch content in maize kernels, a multiparent population (MPP) was constructed and evaluated for starch content in three different environments.The integration of QTL mapping and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) identified two SNPs, 8_166371888 and 8_178656036, which overlapped the QTL interval of qSC8-1, identified in the tropical maize line YML46. The phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by the QTL qSC8-1 was12.17%, while the SNPs 8_166371888 and 8_178656036 explained 10.19% and 5.72% of the phenotypic variance. Combined GWAS and QTL analyses led to the identification of two candidate genes, Zm00001d012005 and Zm00001d012687 located on chromosome 8.The candidate gene Zm00001d012005 encodes histidine kinase, which is known to play a role in starch accumulation in rice spikes. Related histidine kinases, such as AHK1, are involved in endosperm transfer cell development in barley, which affects grain quality. Zm00001d012687 encodes triacylglycerol lipase, which reduces seed oil content. Since oil content in cereal kernels is negatively correlated with starch content, this gene is likely involved in regulating the starch content in maize kernels. These findings provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying kernel starch content and establish a theoretical basis for breeding maize varieties with high starch content."
39859501,response to salt,Analysis of the Transcriptome Provides Insights into the Photosynthate of Maize Response to Salt Stress by 5-Aminolevulinic Acid.,"Salt stress is a significant environmental factor that impedes maize growth and yield. Exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been shown to mitigate the detrimental effects of various environmental stresses on plants. However, its regulatory role in the photosynthesis mechanisms of maize seedlings under salt stress remains poorly understood. Transcriptome sequencing and physiological index measurements were conducted on the leaves of the ""Zhengdan 958"" cultivar subjected to three different treatments. Differential expression analysis revealed 4634 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including key transcription factor (TF) families such as NAC, MYB, WRKY, and MYB-related, across two comparisons (SS_vs_CK and ALA_SS_vs_SS). Significant enrichment was observed in the metabolic pathways related to porphyrin metabolism, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. ALA treatment modulated the expression of photosynthesis-related genes, increased photosynthetic pigment content, and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), thereby mitigating the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, ALA increased starch content under salt stress. These findings establish a foundational understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which ALA regulates photosynthesis under salt stress in maize seedlings. Collectively, exogenous ALA enhances maize's salt tolerance by regulating photosynthesis-related pathways."
39873897,response to Rhizoctonia solani,ZmDREB1A controls plant immunity via regulating salicylic acid metabolism in maize.,"DREB1A, a pivotal transcription factor, has long been known to regulate plant abiotic stress tolerance. However, its role in plant biotic stress tolerance and the underlying mechanisms have remained a mystery. Our research reveals that the maize ZmDREB1A gene is up-regulated in maize seedlings when the plants are infected by Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani). The maize ZmDREB1A knock-out mutant exhibits increased disease resistance against the pathogen R. solani. Further investigation showed that ZmDREB1A regulates salicylic acid (SA) metabolism by inhibiting ZmSARD1 gene and activating ZmSAGT gene expression. Additionally, the SA level was increased while the SAG level was decreased in zmdreb1a mutant seedlings when the plants were infected with the pathogen R. solani. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmSAGT in Arabidopsis reduced plant resistance to Pst DC3000 by decreasing SA levels and increasing SAG levels. These data demonstrate that ZmDREB1A regulates the metabolism of SA and controls plant immune response in maize."
39881824,drought response,"Integrated analysis of transcriptome, sRNAome, and degradome involved in the drought-response of maize Zhengdan958.","Drought is a major abiotic stress in restricting the growth, development, and yield of maize. As a significant epigenetic regulator, small RNA also functions in connecting the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory network. Further to help comprehending the molecular mechanisms underlying drought adaptability and tolerance of maize, an integrated multi-omics analysis of transcriptome, sRNAome, and degradome was performed on the seedling roots of an elite hybrid Zhengdan958 under drought stress. In this study, 2,911 genes, 32 conserved miRNAs, and 12 novel miRNAs showed a significantly differential expression under drought stress. Moreover, 6,340 target genes of 445 miRNAs were validated using degradome sequencing, forming 281 miRNA-mRNA pairs in control (CK) and drought-stressed (DS) library. These target genes were mainly involved in the plant hormone signal transduction and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. The integrated multi-omics analysis revealed that five DEmiRNA-mRNA pairs displayed negatively correlated expression patterns, which were also verified by qRT-PCR. Tissue-specific expression profile and regulatory network analysis revealed that miR528a/b-Zm00001d021850, miR408a/b-Zm00001d020794, and miR164e-Zm00001d003414 might be essential in root-specific drought stress response of maize Zhengdan958 seedlings. These worthwhile will promote the functional characterization of miRNA-mRNA modules response to drought stress, and potentially contribute to drought-resistance breeding of maize."
39887997,response to cold stress,"Integrating physiological, metabolome and transcriptome revealed the response of maize seeds to combined cold and high soil moisture stresses.","Combined cold and high moisture stress (CHS) is a prevalent abiotic stress during maize sowing in northeast China, severely affecting the growth of seedlings and seed germination. However, the mechanism underlying seed growth responses to CHS remains unclear. We used Jidan441 (JD441, CHS-resistant) and Jidan558 (JD558, CHS-sensitive) as experimental materials. Treatments of 5-day cold (4°C, CS), high moisture (25%, gravimetric water content, HH), and CHS were initiated at sowing, followed by a return to normal growth conditions (20°C during light/ 15°C during dark, 15%) at 7 days after sowing (DAS). CS, HH, and CHS decreased seed root length and surface area. The reduction in root length and surface area in JD441 due to CHS was less severe than in JD558. We found that the difference between CHS and control in JD441was less than that in JD558 at transcriptional and metabolic levels at 7 DAS. After CHS removal, JD441 exhibited a greater increase in α-amylase activity and antioxidant content than JD558, which facilitated starch decomposition and the rapid removal of O2 - and H2O2 in seeds. The rapid recovery of soluble sugar and soluble protein in JD441 helped maintain osmotic balance. Amino acids and genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in response to combined stress in JD441, whereas they were downregulated in JD558. In conclusion, the stress tolerance of JD441 was attributed to its efficient recovery ability from CHS. This study provides a scientific foundation for exploring seed stress tolerance pathways and developing cold and high-moisture-tolerant hybrids."
39888054,response to Rhizoctonia solani,The ZmAHL25-ZmPUB19-ZmMPK5 Module Positively Regulates Resistance to Rhizoctonia solani in Maize.,"Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a crucial mechanism in plant defenses against pathogens. However, the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the maize (Zea mays) defense response against Rhizoctonia solani, a major soil-borne fungal pathogen that causes banded leaf and sheath blight, remains unclear. We previously identified the maize ZmPUB19 gene, which encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase and is upregulated upon R. solani infection, suggesting its potential involvement in maize defense responses. In this study, we established that ZmPUB19 positively influences the maize defense response to R. solani. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ZmPUB19 interacts with and ubiquitinates the mitogen-activated protein kinase ZmMPK5, resulting in ZmMPK5 degradation in response to R. solani infection. The Zmmpk5 mutant demonstrated superior resistance to R. solani compared to the wild type. Additionally, we identified an AT-Hook Motif Nuclear Localized (AHL) transcription factor, ZmAHL25, which binds to the AT-rich cis-element in the ZmPUB19 promoter and activates its expression under R. solani attack. Notably, decreased expression of ZmAHL25 increased maize susceptibility to R. solani. Collectively, our findings show that the ZmAHL25-ZmPUB19-ZmMPK5 module plays a positive role in regulating maize defense responses to R. solani infection."
39893411,drought response,Genome-wide association mapping and genomic prediction analyses reveal the genetic architecture of grain yield and agronomic traits under drought and optimum conditions in maize.,"Background: Drought is a major abiotic stress in sub-Saharan Africa, impacting maize growth and development leading to severe yield loss. Drought tolerance is a complex trait regulated by multiple genes, making direct grain yield selection ineffective. To dissect the genetic architecture of grain yield and flowering traits under drought stress, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on a panel of 236 maize lines testcrossed and evaluated under managed drought and optimal growing conditions in multiple environments using seven multi-locus GWAS models (mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, pLARmEB, pKWmEB, ISIS EM-BLASSO, and FARMCPU) from mrMLM and GAPIT R packages. Genomic prediction with RR-BLUP model was applied on BLUEs across locations under optimum and drought conditions. 

Results: A total of 172 stable and reliable quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified, of which 77 are associated with GY, AD, SD, ASI, PH, EH, EPO and EPP under drought and 95 are linked to GY, AD, SD, ASI, PH, EH, EPO and EPP under optimal conditions. Among these QTNs, 17 QTNs explained over 10% of the phenotypic variation (R2 ≥ 10%). Furthermore, 43 candidate genes were discovered and annotated. Two major candidate genes, Zm00001eb041070 closely associated with grain yield near peak QTN, qGY_DS1.1 (S1_216149215) and Zm00001eb364110 closely related to anthesis-silking interval near peak QTN, qASI_DS8.2 (S8_167256316) were identified, encoding AP2-EREBP transcription factor 60 and TCP-transcription factor 20, respectively under drought stress. Haplo-pheno analysis identified superior haplotypes for qGY_DS1.1 (S1_216149215) associated with the higher grain yield under drought stress. Genomic prediction revealed moderate to high prediction accuracies under optimum and drought conditions. 

Conclusion: The lines carrying superior haplotypes can be used as potential donors in improving grain yield under drought stress. Integration of genomic selection with GWAS results leads not only to an increase in the prediction accuracy but also to validate the function of the identified candidate genes as well increase in the accumulation of favorable alleles with minor and major effects in elite breeding lines. This study provides valuable insight into the genetic architecture of grain yield and secondary traits under drought stress."
39898260,grain filling duration; response to heat stress,The molecular mechanism by which heat stress during the grain filling period inhibits maize grain filling and reduces yield.,"High temperatures significantly impair plant growth and development by restricting maize grain filling; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress remain poorly understood. In this study, 350 maize inbred lines were evaluated under field conditions, leading to the identification of heat-tolerant Zheng58 and heat-sensitive Qi319. The two inbred lines were exposed to controlled conditions of 30°C/20°C (optimal) and 42°C/30°C (heat stress) during the grain filling period. Heat stress significantly reduced thousand-kernel weight and seed setting rates, with Qi319 experiencing more pronounced declines. In contrast, Zheng58 showed superior performance, with a grain filling rate 48% higher and seed setting rate 57% greater than Qi319. Transcriptome analysis showed that heat stress disrupted starch biosynthesis and hormonal homeostasis, notably affecting abscisic acid and auxin pathways. Additionally, photosynthetic and transpiration rates in panicle leaves were reduced due to the downregulation of genes related to light-harvesting complexes, photosystem I subunits, and water transport. These findings highlight the critical roles of starch metabolism, hormonal regulation, and photosynthetic efficiency in heat tolerance, offering valuable insights for developing heat-resilient maize varieties to mitigate yield losses under high-temperature conditions."
39901747,leaf shrinkage; drought response,"Long-Term in vivo Observation of Maize Leaf Xylem Embolism, Transpiration and Photosynthesis During Drought and Recovery.","Plant water transport is essential to maintain turgor, photosynthesis and growth. Water is transported in a metastable state under large negative pressures, which can result in embolism, that is, the loss of function by the replacement of liquid xylem sap with gas, as a consequence of water stress. To avoid experimental artefacts, we used an optical vulnerability system to quantify embolism occurrence across six fully expanded maize leaves to characterize the sequence of physiological responses (photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, whole-plant transpiration and leaf inter-vein distance) in relation to declining water availability and leaf embolism during severe water stress. Additionally, we characterize the recovery of leaf function in the presence of sustained embolism during a 6-day recovery period. Embolism formation occurred after other physiological processes were substantially depressed and were irreversible upon rewatering. Recovery of transpiration, net CO2 assimilation and photosystem II efficiency were aligned with the severity of embolism, whereas these traits returned to near pre-stress levels in the absence of embolism. A better understanding of the relationships between embolism occurrence and downstream physiological processes during stress and recovery is critical for the improvement of crop productivity and resilience."
39907340,response to Azospirillum brasilense; response to acid soil,"Development of maize under different pH values, humidity and presence of Azospirillum brasilense.","Abiotic factors play a crucial role in the productivity of agricultural systems, and stress resulting from these factors can significantly restrict crop yields. To address this challenge, the use of tools capable of mitigating adverse effects, such as growth-promoting bacteria, is essential. This study aimed to investigate the growth of maize plants inoculated or not with Azospirillum brasilense, subjected to variations in soil pH and moisture. Two experiments were conducted under controlled conditions, in which maize plants inoculated with A. brasilense were subjected to variations in (i) soil moisture (100, 75, 50, and 25% of field capacity) and (ii) hydrogenic potential (pH 4.5; 5.5; 5.0; 6.0; and 6.5). It was observed that low moisture favored root growth but limited the development of leaves and stems of maize plants at the V4 phenological stage. The increased root development provided by A. brasilense under conditions of water restriction resulted in a reduction in water use efficiency by the leaves. Additionally, more acidic and/or alkaline pH levels also reduced the dry mass of roots and aboveground parts, as well as the carboxylation efficiency of rubisco, but increased water use efficiency (At 25% FC water deficit, WUE increased by 9.5% in rhizobacterium-treated seeds and by 16% in the control). Inoculation with A. brasilense promoted greater development of maize plants, as evidenced by increased volume, root length, and leaf area. Although maize plants showed better initial development without water restriction and in soil with a pH of 5.9, A. brasilense allowed maize plant growth even at pH 5.1, without significant adverse impacts."
39907639,drought response,Exogenously applied ABA alleviates dysplasia of maize (Zea mays L.) ear under drought stress by altering photosynthesis and sucrose transport.,"Drought stress inhibits the development of maize ears. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that can regulate the physicology metabolism under abiotic stress. In this study, maize varieties Zhengdan 958 (ZD958) and Xianyu 335 (XY335) with different filling stages were used as materials. Three treatments were set in the filling period: normal irrigation (CK), drought stress (stress); exogenous ABA + drought stress (ABA+stress). They were used to study the physiological regulation of exogenous ABA on maize ears development during drought stress. Exogenous ABA inhibited bald tip and the decline of maize plant biomass, and increased the number and weight of grains per ear at harvest under drought stress by regulating photosynthetic pigment content (Chla, Chlb, Car), gas exchange parameters (Pn, Tr, gs, Ci, Ls), Chla fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, ФPSII, ETR, qP, NPQ), chloroplast structure and function, photosynthetic enzyme activity, and the transcription level of genes coding SUTs (ZmSUT1, ZmSUT2, ZmSUT4, ZmSUT6). There was a significant correlation between physiological indexes of sucrose loading in maize and yield factors. This study discussed the mechanism of exogenous ABA alleviating maize ear dysplasia at grain filling stage under drought stress from the perspective of photosynthesis and sucrose transport."
39907963,response to Fusarium ear rot,QTL mapping of Fusarium ear rot resistance using genotyping by target sequencing (GBTS) in maize.,"Fusarium ear rot (FER) is a global disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Maize FER resistance is a quantitative trait controlled by polygenes. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) population involving 159 lines, developed from the inbred lines B73 (susceptible) and CXS161 (highly resistant), was inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides across 4-year-location environment combinations in China during 2021 and 2022. The lines were genotyped using target sequencing with a 10 K SNP array. The results showed that the estimated broad-sense heritability (H2) in each environment ranged from 0.659 to 0.871, with an overall H2 of 0.805. The average genetic length between adjacent markers in the genetic map constructed using multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (mSNP) was smaller than that constructed using SNP, whereas the maximal genetic length was almost the same. Using a genetic map constructed with a SNP, two quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified on chromosomes 2 and 5, which explained 7.65% and 9.58% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Using the genetic map constructed by mSNP, four QTL were identified, explaining 6.04-12.60% of the phenotypic variation. Moreover, two kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed using single-marker analysis methods, with one KASP marker validated across a backcross population that can be effectively used to identify FER resistance. In conclusion, using mSNP for genetic map construction does not confer advantages when the population size is limited and the marker density is high. However, the mSNP-constructed map identified more minor-effect QTL despite possessing a lower likelihood of the odds (LOD) values."
39913586,drought response,Moisture-responsive root-branching pathways identified in diverse maize breeding germplasm,"Plants grow complex root systems to extract unevenly distributed resources from soils. Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture. 
Editor’s summary: In a heterogeneous soil landscape, plant root systems must locate water. Scharwies et al. found that some maize varieties produce lateral roots at locations where water is limited, whereas others more efficiently direct growth toward water. Uncovering the genetic basis for this trait variance, the authors found that auxin, ethylene, and an arabinogalactan protein work together to encourage lateral root development where water is present while suppressing lateral roots from forming on drier parts of the root. Variation in genes underlying these components leads to variation in root hydropatterning, potentially affecting the success of some maize varieties in drier environments. —Madeleine Seale"
39917602,drought response,Combining genotyping approaches improves resolution for association mapping: a case study in tropical maize under water stress conditions.,"Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) identify genome variations related to specific phenotypes using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. Genotyping platforms like SNP-Array or sequencing-based techniques (GBS) can genotype samples with many SNPs. These approaches may bias tropical maize analyses due to reliance on the temperate line B73 as the reference genome. An alternative is a simulated genome called ""Mock,"" adapted to the population using bioinformatics. Recent studies show SNP-Array, GBS, and Mock yield similar results for population structure, heterotic groups definition, tester selection, and genomic hybrid prediction. However, no studies have examined the results generated by these different genotyping approaches for GWAS. This study aims to test the equivalence among the three genotyping scenarios in identifying significant effect genes in GWAS. To achieve this, maize was used as the model species, where SNP-Array genotyped 360 inbred lines from a public panel via the Affymetrix platform and GBS. The GBS data were used to perform SNP calling using the temperate inbred line B73 as the reference genome (GBS-B73) and a simulated genome ""Mock"" obtained in-silico (GBS-Mock). The study encompassed four above-ground traits with plants grown under two levels of water supply: well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS). In total, 46, 34, and 31 SNP were identified in the SNP-Array, GBS-B73, and GBS-Mock scenarios, respectively, across the two water levels, associated with the evaluated traits following the comparative analysis of each genotyping method individually. Overall, the identified candidate genes varied along the various scenarios but had the same functionality. Regarding SNP-Array and GBS-B73, genes with functional similarity were identified even without coincidence in the physical position of the SNPs. These genes and regions are involved in various processes and responses with applications in plant breeding. In terms of accuracy, the combination of genotyping scenarios compared to those isolated is feasible and recommended, as it increased all traits under both water conditions. In this sense, it is worth highlighting the combination of GBS-B73 and GBS-Mock scenarios, not only due to the increase in the resolution of GWAS results but also the reduction of costs associated with genotyping and the possibility of conducting genomic breeding methods."
39928574,drought response,The maize GSK3-like kinase ZmSK1 negatively regulates drought tolerance by phosphorylating the transcription factor ZmCPP2.,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinases play important roles in stress responses in plants. However, the mechanism of GSK3-like kinases in drought-induced antioxidant defense is not clear. In this study, we discovered that the GSK3-like kinase SHAGGY-like kinase 1 (ZmSK1) negatively regulates drought tolerance by inhibiting antioxidant defense in maize (Zea mays). Then, we determined that Cysteine-rich Polycomb-like protein 2 (ZmCPP2) interacts with ZmSK1 and enhances maize drought tolerance by inducing antioxidant defense. ZmCPP2 is phosphorylated at Ser-250 by ZmSK1, which is dependent on ZmSK1 kinase activity and attenuates maize drought tolerance. Furthermore, ZmCPP2 directly binds to the promoter of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene ZmSOD4, encoding an antioxidant defense enzyme, and activates its expression. ZmSK1 phosphorylating ZmCPP2 at Ser-250 represses the binding of ZmCPP2 to the ZmSOD4 promoter. Taken together, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of ZmCPP2 by ZmSK1 results in decreased SOD activity, and thus reduces drought tolerance in maize. These ﬁndings reveal a mechanism of GSK3-like kinases regulating antioxidant defense in the drought stress response."
39935173,internode length (stem); plant height,Genetic dissection of internode length confers improvement for ideal plant architecture in maize.,"The optimal plant architecture, characterized by short stature, helps mitigate lodging, enables high-density planting, and facilitates mechanized harvesting. Internode length (IL), a crucial component of plant height in maize, plays a significant role in these processes. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying internode elongation remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study to dissect the genetic architecture of IL in maize. The lengths of five internodes above and below the ear (referred as IL-related traits) were collected across multiple environments, revealing substantial variation. A total of 108 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were associated with 11 IL-related traits, with 17 QTL co-detected by different traits. Notably, three QTL have been selected in maize breeding progress. Three hundred and three genes associated with IL were found to operate through plant hormone signal transduction, receptor activity, and carbon metabolism pathways, influencing internode elongation. ZmIL1, which encodes alcohol dehydrogenase, exhibited a high expression level in internodes during the vegetative stage and has been selected in Chinese modern maize breeding. Additionally, ZmIL2 and ZmIL3 emerged as other crucial regulators of IL. Importantly, ZmIL1 has potential applications in maize varieties in the Huang-Huai-Hai region. This study represents the first comprehensive report on the genetic architecture of nearly all ILs in maize, providing profound insights into internode elongation mechanisms and genetic resources. These findings hold significant implications for dwarf breeding programs aimed at optimizing plant architecture for enhancing agronomic performance."
39936495,haploid production,Harnessing haploid-inducer mediated genome editing for accelerated maize variety development.,"The integration of haploid induction and genome editing, termed HI-Edit/IMGE, is a promising tool for generating targeted mutations for crop breeding. However, the technical components and stacking suitable for the maize seed industry have yet to be fully characterised and tested. Here, we developed and assessed three HI-Edit/IMGE maize lines: EditWx, EditSh, and EditWx&Sh, using the haploid inducer CHOI3 and lines engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 system targeting the Waxy1 (Wx1) and Shrunken2 (Sh2) genes. We meticulously characterised the HI-Edit/IMGE systems, focusing on copy numbers and the mutant alleles mtl and dmp, which facilitate haploid induction. Using B73 and six other parental lines of major commercial varieties as recipients, HI-Edit/IMGE demonstrated maternal haploid induction efficiencies ranging from 8.55% to 20.89% and targeted mutation rates between 0.38% and 1.46%. Comprehensive assessment verified the haploid identification, target gene editing accuracy, genome background integrity, and related agronomic traits. Notably, EditWx&Sh successfully combined distinct CRISPR-Cas9 systems to induce multiple desired mutations, highlighting the potential of HI-Edit/IMGE in accelerating the integration of edited traits into commercial maize varieties. Our findings underscore the importance of meticulous Cas9 copy number characterisation and highlight potential challenges related to somatic chimerism. We also validated the performance of single-cross haploids derived using the HI-Edit/IMGE process. Our results confirm the industrial applicability of generating targeted mutations through pollination and provide critical insights for further optimising this technology."
39936861,response to plant population; plant height,DBB2 regulates plant height and shade avoidance responses in maize.,"Increasing plant density has been recognized as an effective strategy for boosting maize yields over the past few decades. However, dense planting significantly reduces the internal light intensity and the red to far-red (R:FR) light ratio in the canopy, which subsequently triggers shade avoidance responses (SAR) that limit further yield enhancements, particularly under high-density conditions. In this study, we identified double B-box containing protein DBB2, a member of the ZmBBX family that is rapidly induced by shade, as a crucial regulator of plant height and SAR. Disruption of DBB2 resulted in shorter internodes, reduced plant height, decreased cell elongation, and diminished sensitivity to shade in maize, effects that can be largely alleviated by external treatment with gibberellins (GA). Furthermore, we discovered that DBB2 physically interacted with the transcription factor HY5, inhibiting its transcriptional activation of ZmGA2ox4, a gene encoding a GA2 oxidase that can deactivate GA. This interaction positively influences maize plant height through the GA pathway. Additionally, we found that the induction of ZmDBB2 by shade is mediated by the transcription factor PIF4. Interestingly, DBB2 then interacted with PIF4 to enhance the transcriptional activation of cell elongation-related genes, such as ZmEXPA1, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop promoting cell elongation under canopy shade conditions. Our findings highlight the critical role of BBX proteins in modulating plant height and SAR, presenting them as key genetic targets for developing maize varieties suited to high-density planting conditions. This study also provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SAR and offers potential strategies for the genetic improvement of maize plant architecture and grain yield."
39938596,mycorrhizal infection; response to low phosphorus,SYMRK significantly affected AMF symbiosis and plant growth in maize.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important symbiotic microorganisms in the soil that form reciprocal relationships with most plants to enhance their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil. The establishment of symbiosis between plants and AMF involves complex molecular mechanisms, and the SYMRK (Symbiosis receptor-like kinase) plays a pivotal role in the establishment of symbiosis. Maize (Zea mays) is a globally significant crop and one of the hosts for AMF, but research on AMF symbiosis-related genes in maize is limited. In this study, we identified a symbiosis receptor kinase in maize, named ZmSYMRK, which corresponds to the ortholog gene OsSYMRK in rice. ZmSYMRK encodes a cell membrane-localized protein kinase that is crucial for AMF colonization. We demonstrated that ZmSYMRK deletion resulted in severe defects in maize symbiosis with AMF. The colonization rates of zmsymrk mutants were significantly reduced at three different time points, and the colonization defects did not recover with prolonged colonization time. Furthermore, the deletion of the ZmSYMRK gene severely affected plant growth under low phosphorus conditions, and the growth defects of the mutants were even more pronounced after symbiosis. We conclude that ZmSYMRK plays a crucial role in both plant growth and the establishment of symbiotic relationships with AMF. 
Highlights: 
    •    ZmSYMRK is a symbiotic receptor kinase in maize, localized to the cell membrane. 
    •    The expression of the ZmSYMRK gene is induced by AMF. 
    •    The absence of ZmSYMRK significantly affects the symbiosis between maize and AMF.

39945127,response to salt,Earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improve salt tolerance in maize through symplastic pathways.,"Symplastic pathways involving plasma membrane H+-ATPases and Na+/H+ antiporters maintain sodium (Na+) homeostasis in the symplastic pathways and protect plant functions under salt stress. In this study, we characterised the effects of earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on Na+ absorption and transport in roots. Measurements of root Na+ content, plasma membrane H+-ATPase and Na+/H+ antiporter and antioxidant enzyme activities were performed together with transcriptome analysis. The addition of earthworms and AMF under saline conditions decreased the accumulation of Na+ in maize roots and significantly increased the root K:Na ratios, as well as increasing the levels of transcripts encoding plasma membrane H+-ATPases, Na+/H+ antiporters, antioxidant enzymes and proteins involved in nitrogen and phosphorus uptake under saline conditions. The transcript changes induced by earthworms and AMF indicate that abscisic acid mediates the effects on salt tolerance. Taken together, these findings suggest that earthworms and AMF improve the salt tolerance of maize seedlings through improved symplastic pathways."
39947180,response to Striga,Resistance to Striga parasitism through reduction of strigolactone exudation.,"Parasitism with Striga poses a major threat to global food production. Striga germination and growth rely on strigolactones (SLs) exuded by crop roots under phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions, although the mechanism of this host-parasite interaction remains elusive. In this study, transcriptomic and functional analyses of sorghum treated with Pi deficiency or the SL GR245DS identify two ABC transporter G (ABCG) transporters of SL, Sorghum biocolor strigolactones transporter 1 (SbSLT1) and SbSLT2. Using AlphaFold2 and amino acid conversion mutants, we identify highly conserved amino acids in SL transport channels essential for transport function. Sorghum lines with single or double knockouts of these transporters exhibit significantly reduced SL secretion from roots, leading to decreased Striga germination and parasitism in field experiments and consequently reducing the grain loss under Striga infestation. This study thus describes the mechanism of SL exudation in monocots and defines conserved residues essential for SL transporter function, offering a potential strategy for enhancing crop resistance to Striga parasitism."
39948440,response to cold stress,Diverse coping modes of maize in cool environment at early growth.,"Background: Maize cultivation has considerably expanded beyond its place of origin in Central America. The successful adaptation of maize to temperate climates can be achieved by selecting genotypes that demonstrate tolerance to low temperatures, especially in cold springs. In maize, cold tolerance at the early growth stages enables early sowing, a long growing season, and eventually high yields, even in temperate climates. Maize adaptation during early growth has not been thoroughly investigated; therefore, we tested the working hypothesis that several distinct and independent adaptation strategies may be involved in maize habituation to cool temperate climates during seedling establishment. 

Results: We studied the effect of mild cold stress (day/night 16/12 °C) on early growth stage followed by regrowth at optimal daily temperatures (24/21 °C). Automated plant phenotyping was performed on 30 inbred lines selected from a diverse genetic pool during preliminary studies. As a result, we generated time series based on selected morphological parameters, spectral parameters, and spectral vegetation indices. These curves were clustered and four classes of maize with clearly contrasting growth modes and changes in their physiological status were distinguished at low temperatures and during regrowth. Two classes comprised either cold-sensitive (slow growth and poor physiological status in cold) or cold-tolerant (moderately fast growth and good physiological status in cold) lines. However, two other classes showed that growth rate and physiological status at low temperature is not necessarily related, for instance one class included lines with small seedlings but good physiological status and the other grouped seedlings with rapid growth despite poor physiological status. These classes clearly exhibited different modes of cold adaptation. Moreover, a class containing cold-sensitive inbred lines may represent a distinct and novel type of cold-adaptation strategy related to the arrest of coleoptile emerge related with ability to recover rapidly under favourable conditions. 

Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that maize may have several adaptation strategies to cold environments at early growth stages based on independent mechanisms. These findings suggest that maize adaptability to adverse environments is likely more complex than previously understood."
39950502,plant height,Experimental evolution in maize with replicated divergent selection identifies two plant-height-associated regions.,"Experimental evolution studies are common in agricultural research, where they are often deemed ""long-term selection."" These are often used to perform selection mapping, which involves identifying markers that were putatively under selection based on finding signals of selection left in the genome. A challenge of previous selection mapping studies, especially in agricultural research, has been the specification of robust significance thresholds. This is in large part because long-term selection studies in crops have rarely included replication. Usually, significance thresholds in long-term selection experiments are based on outliers from an empirical distribution. This approach is prone to missing true positives or including false positives. Under laboratory conditions with model species, replicated selection has been shown to be a powerful tool, especially for the specification of significance thresholds. Another challenge is that commonly used single-marker-based statistics may identify neutral linked loci which have hitchhiked along with regions that are actually under selection. In this study, we conducted divergent, replicated selection for short and tall plant height in a random-mating maize population under real field conditions. Selection of the 5% tallest and shortest plants was conducted for 3 generations. Significance thresholds were specified using the false discovery rate for selection (FDRfS) based on a window-based statistic applied to a statistic leveraging replicated selection (FSTSum). Overall, we found 2 significant regions putatively under selection. One region was located on chromosome 3 close to the plant-height genes Dwarf1 and iAA8. We applied a haplotype block analysis to further dissect the pattern of selection in significant regions of the genome. We observed patterns of strong selection in the subpopulations selected for short plant height on chromosome 3."
39963376,drought response,The overexpression of ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APX2) gene improves drought tolerance in maize,"Maize, a primary global food crop, is crucial for food security. In recent years, climatic and other abiotic stresses have led to frequent global droughts. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) plays a vital role in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle. Under drought stress, APX effectively scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by plants and maintains the normal growth and development of organisms. This study successfully amplified APX-related genes, and the ZmAPX2 gene was screened using expression analysis. pCAMBIA3301-ZmAPX2-Bar and pCXB053-ZmAPX2-Bar plant expression vectors were constructed and transformed into the maize inbred line H120. Drought tolerance of plants was analyzed by phenotypic characteristics, physiological and biochemical indices in T2 generation positive maize seedlings as well as agronomic traits at maturity. Results indicate that boosting APX2 gene expression enhances maize drought resistance by reducing ROS content. This research underpins the exploration of new drought-tolerant maize germplasm and resistance mechanisms."
39969247,response to heat stress,Salicylic Acid Cooperates With Lignin and Sucrose Signals to Alleviate Waxy Maize Leaf Senescence Under Heat Stress.,"Leaf senescence induced by high temperature (HT) has become a primary factor limiting maize yield, particularly during the filling stage. Exogenous salicylic acid (SA) has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate leaf senescence and HT-induced damage, though its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the regulatory mechanism of SA application on waxy maize subjected to HT during the early filling stage. Compared to HT alone, exogenous SA alleviated the inhibition of photosynthesis and oxidative damage by enhancing the activities of enzymes involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant system and modulating phytohormone metabolism and signal transduction pathways, thereby reducing leaf senescence and mitigating yield loss under HT. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that HT downregulated most genes involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway in leaves but promoted soluble sugar accumulation, which represents a plant strategy to cope with HT. Conversely, exogenous SA reversed this change and further enhanced soluble sugar accumulation in leaves. SA also regulated sugar metabolism by inhibiting trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis and activating SnRK1 to resist HT. Furthermore, SA stimulated lignin biosynthesis through the phenylpropanoid pathway, ensuring cell membrane integrity under HT. The relationship between SA signalling and plant heat tolerance was validated using a maize SA synthesis-synthetic mutant."
39973110,Growth and Development,Diverse roles of ethylene in maize growth and development and its importance in shaping plant architecture.,"The gaseous plant hormone ethylene is a key developmental and growth regulator, and a pivotal endogenous response signal to abiotic and biotic interactions, including stress. Much of what is known about ethylene biosynthesis, perception and signaling comes from decades of research primarily in Arabidopsis thaliana and other eudicot model systems. In contrast, detailed knowledge on the ethylene pathway and response to the hormone is markedly limited in maize (Zea mays L.), a global cereal crop that is a major source of calories for humans and livestock, as well as a key industrial biofeedstock. Recent reports of forward screens and targeted reverse genetics have provided important insight into conserved and unique differences of the ethylene pathway and downstream responses. Natural and edited allelic variation in the promoter regions and coding sequences of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes alters maize shoot and root architectures, and plays a crucial role in biomass and grain yields. This review discusses recent advances in ethylene research in maize with an emphasis on ethylene's role in regulating growth and development of the shoot and root systems, and ultimately how this crucial hormone impacts plant architecture and grain yield. 
Highlight: 
Ethylene is involved in numerous developmental and physiological processes in plants, and is a pivotal stress response hormone. Research in maize highlights conserved and divergent aspects of the ethylene pathway."
39985592,kernel development,"Dek570-1, a PPR-DYW protein, is required for maize seed and plant development via modulation of C-to-U RNA editing in mitochondria and chloroplasts.","Main conclusion: Maize Dek570-1 affects the expression and function of organellar genes by performing cytidines-to-uridines RNA editing at specific sites of mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts, thereby regulating seed and plant development. 
Cytidines-to-uridines (C-to-U) RNA editing at specific sites of mitochondrial and plastid transcripts is crucial for the expression and function of organellar genes, which requires PPR proteins. Here, we report the map-based cloning and characterization of Defective Kernel 570-1 (Dek570-1), which encodes a PPR-DYW protein and is an allele of Emp17. However, compared to the empty pericarp and embryonic lethality of emp17 (W22 background), dek570-1 (Zheng58 background) can produce small but viable seeds despite reducing the size of embryo and endosperm. dek570-1 plants are short and yellowed, but they can reproduce offspring. In mitochondria, loss-of-function of Dek570-1 abolishes the C-to-U editing at nad2-677 and ccmFC-799 sites, and reduces the editing at ccmFC-906 site, consistent with Emp17 deficiency. But unlike the reduced editing of the ccmFC-966 site in emp17, the ccmFC-966 site in dek570-1 is fully edited, and several other editing sites such as ccmFC-87, ccmFC-301, and ccmFC-306 are also found. More noteworthy is that Dek570-1 is not only located in mitochondria like Emp17, but also in chloroplasts. Correspondingly, the editing at rpl20-308 site of dek570-1 chloroplasts was significantly reduced, affecting the expression of some rRNAs, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP)- and nuclear-encoded single-subunit RNA polymerase (NEP)-dependent genes, thereby reducing chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic rate. Together, these results indicate that Dek570-1 is essential for C-to-U editing at several sites in mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts, as well as for seed and plant development, and that this locus (Zm00001d028422) may have generated some functional evolutionary divergence in maize with different genetic backgrounds."
39985811,anthesis date,"Tasselyzer, a machine learning method to quantify maize anther exertion, based on PlantCV.","Maize anthers emerge from male-only florets, a process that involves complex genetic programming and is affected by environmental factors. Quantifying anther exertion provides a key indicator of male fertility; however, traditional manual scoring methods are often subjective and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we developed Tasselyzer - an accessible, cost-effective, and time-saving method for quantifying maize anther exertion. This image-based program uses the PlantCV platform to provide a quantitative assessment of anther exertion by capturing regional differences within the tassel based on the distinct color of anthers. We applied this method to 22 maize lines with six genotypes, showing high precision (F1 score > 0.8). Furthermore, we demonstrate that customizing the parameters to assay a specific line is straightforward and practical for enhancing precision in additional genotypes. Tasselyzer is a valuable resource for maize research and breeding programs, enabling automated and efficient assessments of anther exertion."
39988889,drought response,Maize 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase Zm4CL-like9 gene positively regulates drought stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Maize is a major food crop in China, and drought is one of the major abiotic stresses that threaten the growth and development of the crop, seriously affecting the crop yield. 4-coumaric acid coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropane metabolic pathway, which can regulate the lignin content of the plant and play an important role in the plant's resistance to drought stress, plays an important role in plant resistance to drought stress. In the present study, we screened the differentially expressed up-regulated gene Zm4CL-like9 under drought stress by pre-transcriptome sequencing data (PRJNA793522) in the laboratory, and analyzed the significant up-regulation of Zm4CL-like9 gene in roots under drought stress by qRT-PCR(Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR). The results of prokaryotic expression experiments showed that the protein encoded by the Zm4CL-like9 gene was able to be expressed in prokaryotic cells and could effectively improve the drought tolerance of E. coli. Phenotypic analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under drought stress revealed that seed germination rate, root length, and plant survival after drought rehydration were significantly higher in transgenic Zm4CL-like9 Arabidopsis compared with wild-type Arabidopsis; physiological and biochemical indexes revealed that peroxidase activity, proline (Pro) content, and chlorophyll content were significantly higher in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with wild-type Arabidopsis. Under drought stress, the expression of drought-related genes was significantly up-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with wild-type Arabidopsis. Taken together, the Zm4CL-like9 gene enhances plant resistance to drought stress by reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation in plants."
39993625,response to Fusarium seedling rot,Enhancing maize resistance to Fusarium verticillioides through modulation of cell wall structure and components by ZmXYXT2,"Introduction: 
Fusarium verticillioides (F. verticillioides) is a prevalent phytopathogen that incites severe diseases in maize, resulting in substantial reductions in grain yield and quality. Despite its widespread impact, the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to this pathogen remain elusive, with only a limited of resistant genes having been identified to date. 
Objectives: 
Characterize the function of ZmXYXT2 encoding a putative xylan xylosyltransferase in maize defense against F. verticillioides-induced diseases.
Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR and transitory transformation of maize protoplasts were conducted to analyze the expression pattern and subcellular localization of ZmXYXT2. The zmxyxt2 mutant, sourced from an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis library, and the ZmXYXT2-overexpressing plants, generated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, were utilized for artificial inoculation with F. verticillioides followed by disease severity assessments. Phenotypic assessments, cytological observations, analysis of cell wall components, and histochemical staining were performed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of ZmXYXT2. 
Results: The absence of ZmXYXT2 renders maize vulnerable to F. verticillioides-caused seedling blight, stalk rot, ear rot and seed rot, along with a notable increase in fumonisin B1 accumulation. Conversely, maize plants overexpressing ZmXYXT2 exhibited significantly heightened immunity to these diseases. Moreover, overexpression of ZmXYXT2 results in notable changes in the composition of maize cell walls, specifically increasing the levels of arabinose, xylose and ferulic acid. These alterations lead to cell wall thickening, effectively barring the intracellular invasion and colonization of F. verticillioides, thereby halting pathogen dissemination between cells. Intriguingly, maize plants overexpressing ZmXYXT2 exhibit enhanced stem strength without compromising yield-related traits.
Conclusion: ZmXYXT2 provides maize with resistance to multiple diseases triggered by F. verticillioides and mitigates the accumulation of fumonisin B1. Our study presents a novel approach to bolster maize comprehensive resistance against F. verticillioides-induced diseases by modifying cell wall composition to strengthen its natural defenses. 
Highlights: 
    •     ZmXYXT2 encodes a putative xylan xylosyltransferase located in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi. 
    •    Lack of ZmXYXT2 compromises maize resistance to multiple disease caused by F. verticillioides. 
    •    Enhanced ZmXYXT2 expression improves maize defense against F. verticillioides without affecting yield. 
    •    Disruption of ZmXYXT2 function alters cell wall structure and composition. 
    •    ZmXYXT2-mediated cell wall defense impedes the invasion and colonization of F. verticillioides."
39994874,disease response,Using genome-wide associations and host-by-pathogen predictions to identify allelic interactions that control disease resistance.,"Characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying disease symptom expression has been used to improve human health and disease resistance in crops and animal breeds. Quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify genomic regions that are involved in disease progression. This study extends traditional GWAS significance tests of host and pathogen marker main effects by utilizing dual-genome reaction norm models to evaluate the importance of host-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by pathogen-SNP interactions. Disease symptom severity data from Fusarium ear rot (FER) on maize (Zea mays L.) is used to demonstrate the use of both genomes in genomic selection models for breeding and the identification of loci that interact across organisms to impact FER disease development. Dual genome prediction models improved heritability estimates, error variances, and model accuracy while providing predictions for host-by-pathogen interactions that may be used to test the significance of SNP-SNP interactions. Independent GWAS for maize and Fusarium populations identified significantly associated loci and predictions that were used to evaluate the importance of interactions using two different association tests. Predictions from dual genome models were used to evaluate the significance of the SNP-SNP interactions that may be associated with population structure or polygenic effects. As well, association tests incorporating host and pathogen markers in models that also included genomic relationship matrices were used to account for population structure. Subsequent evaluation of protein-protein interactions from candidate genes near the interacting SNPs provides a further in silico evaluation method to expedite the identification of interacting genes. 

Plain Language Summary: 

Breeding for disease resistance primarily uses large host plant populations to estimate breeding values of certain plant genotypes. Combining DNA marker data from both host and pathogen populations allows for the identification of markers and genes that impact the progression of disease and those that interact to affect disease severity. Additionally, by including pathogen genomic data into breeding models, the accuracy of disease resistance and virulence predictions improves. This model can also be applied to predict the success of host plant genotypes in novel pathogen environments."
39997732,flavonoid content,Omics Analysis Revealing Flavonoid Content During Maize Grain Germination.,"Background/Objectives: The germination process initiates an active process of secondary metabolism, which produces a series of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids. Methods: A metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis was conducted on maize grains germinated at three different stages. Results: A total of 374 metabolites were detected in maize grains. From the raw maize grain to various stages of germination, 3 anthocyanins, 61 flavones, 12 flavonols, 13 flavanones, and 6 isoflavones were identified, respectively. An integrated omics analysis discovered that a total of 16 flavonoid metabolites were mapped to 4 KEGG pathways, which were associated with 40 related genes. This indicates that germination has significant benefits in improving the nutritional function of corn kernels. Conclusions: In summary, the findings of this study provide valuable insights into flavonoid metabolites and related genes, demonstrating the profound impact of germination treatment on the nutritional and functional aspects of maize grains."
40007166,response to fall armyworm,The airborne herbivore-induced plant volatile indole is converted to benzoxazinoid defense compounds in maize plants.,"Herbivore-induced plant volatiles act as danger signals to prime defense responses in neighboring plants, yet in many cases the mechanism behind this priming is not known. Volatile signals may be recognized directly by receptors and/or converted into other active compounds. Here we investigate the metabolic fate of volatile indole, a known priming signal in maize (Zea mays), to determine if its conversion to other compounds could play a role in its priming of defenses. We identified benzoxazinoids as major products from volatile indole using heavy isotope-labeled volatile indole and Pathway of Origin Determination in Untargeted Metabolomics (PODIUM) analysis. We then used benzoxazinoid biosynthesis maize mutants to investigate their role in indole-mediated priming. Labeled volatile indole was converted into DIMBOA-glucoside in a bx2 (benzoxazinone synthesis2)-dependent manner. The bx2 mutant plants showed elevated green leaf volatile (GLV) production in response to wounding and Spodoptera frugiperda regurgitant irrespective of indole exposure. Thus, volatile indole is converted into benzoxazinoids, and part of its priming mechanism may be due to the enhanced production of these phytoanticipins. However, indole-mediated enhanced GLV production does not rely on the conversion of indole to benzoxazinoids, so indole also has other signaling functions."
40013268,response to Cercospora,Introgression of ZmCPK39 in maize hybrids enhances resistance to gray leaf spot disease without compromising yield.,"Gray leaf spot (GLS) is one of the most damaging foliar diseases in maize. In previous research, we identified the ZmCPK39 gene, which confers resistance to GLS. This study demonstrates the utility of ZmCPK39 in breeding resistant maize varieties. Two parental lines of Zhengdan958 (the most widely cultivated hybrid in China), Chang7-2 and Zheng58, were selected for resistance improvement. These lines were crossed with Y32, a donor line high resistance to GLS, followed by six rounds of backcrossing to their respective recurrent parents. Foreground selection was performed in each generation to detect ZmCPK39, while background selection was conducted in the BC6F1 generations using a Maize 6 K DNA chip. The converted lines, Chang7-2 ZmCPK39 and Zheng58 ZmCPK39 , with a recovery rate of 94.67-96.48%, were crossed to produce the improved hybrid Zhengdan958 ZmCPK39 . This hybrid exhibited enhanced GLS resistance and an 11.95% higher yield under severe disease stress, while maintaining comparable yield performance under normal growth conditions relative to the original Zhengdan958. This study highlights the breeding potential of ZmCPK39 for improving GLS resistance in maize."
40021951,stalk quality; stem development,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals potential regulatory genes involved in the development and strength formation of maize stalks,"Background: 
Stalk strength is a critical trait in maize that influences plant architecture, lodging resistance and grain yield. The developmental stage of maize, spanning from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage, is critical for determining stalk strength. However, the dynamics of the genetic control of this trait remains unclear. 
Results: 
Here, we report a temporal resolution study of the maize stalk transcriptome in one tropical line and one non-stiff-stalk line using 53 transcriptomes collected covering V7 (seventh leaf stage) through silking stage. The time-course transcriptomes were categorized into four phases corresponding to stalk early development, stalk early elongation, stalk late elongation, and stalk maturation. Fuzzy c-means clustering and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses elucidated the chronological sequence of events that occur at four phases of stalk development. Gene Ontology analysis suggests that active cell division occurs in the stalk during Phase I. During Phase II, processes such as cell wall extension, lignin deposition, and vascular cell development are active. In Phase III, lignin metabolic process, secondary cell wall biogenesis, xylan biosynthesis process, cell wall biogenesis, and polysaccharide biosynthetic process contribute to cell wall strengthening. Defense responses, abiotic stresses, and transport of necessary nutrients or substances are active engaged during Phase IV. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the two maize lines presented significant gene expression differences in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Certain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding transcription factors, especially those in the NAC and MYB families, may be involved in stalk development. In addition, six potential regulatory genes associated with stalk strength were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). 
Conclusion: 
The data set provides a high temporal-resolution atlas of gene expression during maize stalk development. These phase-specific genes, differentially expressed genes, and potential regulatory genes reported in this study provide important resources for further studies to elucidate the genetic control of stalk development and stalk strength formation in maize."
40034323,response to armyworm,Transcriptomics integrated with metabolomics reveals the defense response of insect-resistant Zea mays infested with Spodoptera exigua,"Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide. Insect control through host plant resistance plays an important part in improving both yield and quality of maize. Spodoptera exigua is a common insect pest causing destructive damages to maize. To comprehensively understand molecular mechanism of maize defense against S. exigua, integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were conducted in the insect-resistant maize inbred line CML139 infested with S. exigua for 24 h. 9845 differentially expressed genes and 34 significantly changed metabolites were identified in infested leaves. Maize transcriptional response to S. exigua infestation involved in genes encoding enzymes in biosynthetic process (ribosome, glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid metabolism), genes in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, phenylpropanoid pathway and transcription factors. By metabolism analysis, accumulations of amino acids, organic acids, phenylpropanoids and benzoxazinoids (Bxs) were significantly enhanced, with the exception of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). The integrated analysis of transcriptomic and metabolic data demonstrated that both transcripts and metabolites involved in phenylpropanoid and Bxs biosynthesis were differentially modulated in S. exigua infested leaves. This study is valuable in understanding the complex mechanism of interaction between plants and insect herbivores and provide a potential strategy to maize pest control."
40036783,drought response,Drought response of the maize plant-soil-microbiome system is influenced by plant size and presence of root hairs.,"Background and aims: We have abundant knowledge on drought responses of plants or soil microorganisms individually. However, there is a severe lack of knowledge regarding interactions in the plant-soil-microbiome continuum, and specifically root-soil interface traits including the role of root hairs. Here, we investigated how water limitation propagates in a plant-soil-microbiome system upon stopping irrigation. We used two Zea mays genotypes (rth3 and its isogenic wildtype B73), differing in root hair formation, to elucidate the effect of rhizosphere extension under water limitation. 

Methods: For 22 days, WT and rth3 were grown in a climate chamber, with irrigation stopped for drought treatment during the last 7 days. Daily measurements included soil water status, plant evapotranspiration and gas exchange. At harvest, root exudates, shoot relative water content, osmolality and nutrients, root morphological traits and transcriptomics, and soil microbial β-diversity and enzyme activity were determined. 

Key results: In line with a larger plant size, drought stress developed more rapidly and the number of differentially expressed genes was higher in the WT compared to rth3. Under water limitation, root exudation rates increased and soil enzyme activities decreased more strongly in the WT rhizosphere. In both genotypes, water level significantly altered microbial β-diversity in the bulk soil, particularly affecting fungi more than bacteria/archaea. The genotype affected only bacteria/archaea and was more pronounced in rhizosphere than in bulk soil. 

Conclusions: This interdisciplinary study assessed how a short drought stress manifested in a plant-soil-microbiome system. Water limitation altered microbial (fungal) diversity more distant from the root surface. Genotype-specific stress-induced increases in exudation rates modified microbial activity in root proximity, possibly pointing to root hair functions under water limitation. Less intense drought responses of rth3 were confirmed at all levels of investigation and may be due at least in part to its smaller plant size."
40044735,response to Macrophomina phaseolina,Genome-wide association study for resistance to Macrophomina phaseolina in maize (Zea mays L.).,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a frequently used food source in human and animal nutrition. Macrophomina phaseolina is a fungal pathogen causing charcoal rot disease in many plants, especially maize. This pathogen causes high yield losses in maize. The development of resistant maize genotypes is of great importance in controlling this disease. In this study, the population structure of 120 different maize genotypes with varying levels of disease resistance was determined and genome-wide association studies were performed. Each genotype was subjected to the pathogen under controlled conditions and their phenotypic responses to the disease were analyzed. Afterwards, single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined by DArT-seq sequencing. After filtering the SNP data, 37,470 clean SNPs were obtained. The population structure was analyzed with STRUCTURE software, and it was determined that the population was divided into two subgroups. The relationship between phenotypic and genotypic data was analyzed using the MLM (Q + K) model in TASSEL software. As a result, seven SNPs markers located on four different chromosomes were associated with disease resistance. The related markers can be used in the future for the development of maize varieties resistant to M. phaseolina by marker-assisted selection."
40044788,haploid production,Molecular delineation and haplotype analysis of domain membrane protein (DMP) gene influencing in-vivo haploid induction in maize,"Domain membrane protein (DMP) gene is one of the key genes regulating in vivo haploid production in maize. Here, full-length sequence (931 bp) of DMP gene was sequenced in five mutant and five wild-type maize inbreds to study allelic variation. Two SNPs viz., T to C (SNP1) and G to A (SNP2) that distinguished wild-type and mutant- allele of DMP gene, converted methionine to threonine and alanine to threonine at positions 44 and 87, respectively. Two breeder-friendly PCR-based markers (DMP_SNP_TC and DMP_SNP_GA) specific to SNP1 and SNP2 were developed. These markers identified four haplotypes, viz., Hap-DMP-TG, Hap-DMP-CG, Hap-DMP-TA, and Hap-DMP-CA among a set of 48 diverse maize inbreds. Both SNP1 and SNP2 were present in DUF679_motif-2 and DUF679_motif-1, respectively and were conserved among maize and its paralogues, hence resulting in altered protein. Analysis with 11 paralogues of maize showed high similarity with DMP gene. Comparison with 11 paralogues revealed that maize DUF679 protein of DMP gene was more similar to dmp_Zm_Zm00001eb110420 paralogue. Gene structure analysis showed that most of the DMP genes have single exon. The breeder-friendly markers developed in the present study can be utilized in marker-assisted introgression of DMP gene to develop new haploid inducer lines in maize. This is the first report on identification of novel SNP differentiating the wild-type and mutant allele of DMP gene, besides comprehensive molecular characterization of the DMP gene in maize and its paralogues."
40044942,nitrogen use efficiency,Ferredoxin-mediated mechanism for efficient nitrogen utilization in maize,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for plant development and, ultimately, yield. Identifying the genetic components and mechanisms underlying N use efficiency in maize (Zea mays L.) is thus of great importance. Nitrate (NO3−) is the preferred inorganic N source in maize. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of shoot NO3− accumulation in maize seedlings grown under low-NO3− conditions, identifying the ferredoxin family gene ZmFd4 as a major contributor to this trait. ZmFd4 interacts and co-localizes with nitrite reductases (ZmNiRs) in chloroplasts to promote their enzymatic activity. Furthermore, ZmFd4 forms a high-affinity heterodimer with its closest paralogue, ZmFd9, in a NO3−-sensitive manner. Although ZmFd4 exerts similar biochemical functions as ZmFd9, ZmFd4 and ZmFd9 interaction limits their ability to associate with ZmNiRs and stimulate their activity. Knockout lines for ZmFd4 with decreased NO3− contents exhibit more efficient NO3− assimilation, and field experiments show consistently improved N utilization and grain yield under N-deficient conditions. Our work thus provides molecular and mechanistic insights into the natural variation in N utilization, instrumental for genetic improvement of yield in maize and, potentially, in other crops."
40045576,response to sugarcane mosaic virus,Identification of maize genes conditioning the early systemic infection of sugarcane mosaic virus by single-cell transcriptomics,"During the early systemic infection of plant pathogens, individual cells can harbor pathogens at various stages of infection, ranging from absent to abundant. Consequently, the alterations in gene expression levels within these cells in response to the pathogens exhibit significant variability. These variations are pivotal in determining pathogenicity or susceptibility, yet they remain largely unexplored and poorly understood. Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is a representative member of the monocot-infecting potyviruses with a polyadenylated RNA genome, which could be captured by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Here, we performed scRNA-seq with SCMV-infected maize leaves during the early systemic infection (prior to symptom manifestation) to investigate the co-variation patterns between viral accumulation levels and alterations in intracellular gene expression levels. We identified five cell types and found that mesophyll-4 (MS4) cells had the highest viral accumulation levels in most cells. The early systemic infection of SCMV resulted in up-regulation of most differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were mainly enriched in biological processes related to translation, peptide biosynthesis and metabolism. Co-variation analysis of the altered maize gene expression levels and viral accumulation levels in MS1, 2 and 4 revealed several patterns, and the co-expression relationships between them were mainly positive. Furthermore, functional studies identified several potential anti- or pro-viral factors that may play crucial roles during the early stage of SCMV systemic infection. These results not only provide new insights into plant gene regulation during viral infection, but also offer feasible references for future investigations of host-virus interaction across molecular, cellular, and physiological scales."
40057047,germination index; response to cold stress,Maize SERRATE 1B positively regulates seed germinability under low-temperature.,"Low temperature poses a significant threat to seedling emergence after maize sowing. While the impact of SERRATE (SE) on plant development via RNA processing has been extensively reported, its involvement in transcriptional regulation or the formation of low-temperature germination ability remains unclear. Our previous research revealed that ZmSE1B is located at the overlapping region of qLTGR4-1 or qLTPRL4-1, which has been associated with low-temperature germination by QTL analysis using IBM Syn4 RIL population. In the present study, we observed that maize seeds overexpressing ZmSE1B exhibited enhanced germination percentages, longer roots, and longer shoots when subjected to low-temperature conditions compared to the wildtype. Through an integrated analysis of RNA-Seq and CUT&Tag, we speculated that ZmGRXCC17, which encodes a GLUTAREDOXIN, may be upregulated by ZmSE1B in maize germinated seeds at low-temperature. Further, the regulation of ZmSE1B on transcription of ZmGRXCC17 was validated using dual-luciferase reporter system and CUT&Tag-qPCR. Finally, the positive effect of ZmGRXCC17 on low-temperature tolerance during seed germination was elucidated through its heterologous expression in rice. The results indicate that ZmSE1B enhances the seed germination ability under low temperature by regulating the transcription of ZmGRXCC17. 
Highlights: 
    •    ZmSE1B overexpressing maize seeds exhibited greater low-temperature germinability; 
    •    CUT&Tag and RNA-Seq were used for screening target genes of ZmSE1B; 
    •    Regulatory relationship was validated by Dual-luciferase assay and CUT&Tag-qPCR; 
    •    ZmGRXCC17 heterologous expressing rice showed greater low temperature germinability."
40059352,response to flooding,ZmEREB180 modulates waterlogging tolerance in maize by regulating root development and antioxidant gene expression.,"Our findings highlight the critical role of ZmEREB180 in regulating maize tolerance to waterlogging stress (Figure 1u). We demonstrate that ZmEREB180 directly interacts with key genes such as ZmLBD5, ZmLBD38, ZmGST8, ZmGST31, ZmPOD12 and ZmPOD55, positively modulating their expression under waterlogging. We also show that interactions with ZmMPK1 and ZmMPK3 enhance the activation of downstream target genes. Overexpression of ZmLBD5 improves AR formation and waterlogging tolerance across different genetic backgrounds, making it a promising target for developing maize varieties with improved resilience to waterlogging, major abiotic stress affecting global maize production."
40068265,seed viability,Rapid detection of the viability of naturally aged maize seeds using multimodal data fusion and explainable deep learning techniques.,"Seed viability, a key indicator for quality assessment, directly impacts the emergence of field seedlings. The existing nondestructive testing model for maize seed vitality based on naturally aged seeds and predominantly relying on single-modal data like MV and RS, achieves an accuracy of less than 70%. To elucidate the influence of different data on model accuracy, this study proposes the MSCNSVN model for detecting seed viability by collecting multisensor information from maize seeds using sensors, such as MV, RS, TS, FS, and SS. Our findings indicated that (1) the single-modal FS dataset achieved optimal prediction accuracy, with FS570/600 contributing the most; (2) multimodal data fusion outperformed single-modal data, with an accuracy improvement of 10%, while the MV + RS + FS dataset achieved the highest accuracy; (3) the MSCNSVN model demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models; (4) modeling with dual-variety datasets and endosperm surface datasets improved accuracy by 2%-3%. 
Highlights: 
    •    FS has demonstrated significant potential for detecting the viability of corn seeds compared to MV, RS, TS, and SS.
    •    The model constructed with the MV + RS + FS multimodal dataset achieved the most outstanding performance. 
    •    A MSCNSVN model was proposed and performed better than baseline models (SVM, OLE, and CNN). 
    •    The endosperm surface can enhance the accuracy of model in detecting corn seeds viability."
40082303,days to flowering,Maize B chromosome affects the flowering time.,"The influence of maize B chromosomes on flowering time was investigated, revealing a tendency for male flowering time to be delayed with an increase in the number of B chromosomes. This research aimed to verify whether the presence of B chromosomes alters the female and male flowering time of Zea mays L. For this purpose, four experiments were carried out, three with inbred lines of the Zapalote Chico race and the last one with the hybrid Cateto x Zapalote Chico. These experiments consisted of classes differing in the number of B chromosomes and were designed in complete randomized blocks, with two replications. In the three experiments conducted with the inbred lines of the Zapalote Chico race, it was observed that B chromosomes had a minimal influence on female flowering. For male flowering time, the statistical analysis results indicated that at least part of the observed variation in the flowering time could be attributed to differences in the number of extranumerary chromosomes. The analysis of the Cateto x Zapalote Chico hybrid confirmed the results observed in the inbred lines of Zapalote Chico race, showing that the influence of B chromosomes on the flowering time in Zea mays L. was more pronounced in the male flowering time. The mechanism by which B chromosomes alter flowering time is still unknown, and more research is needed to better clarify the possible role that the euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the extranumerary chromosomes may play on the flowering time of Zea mays L."
40082754,alpha tocopherol level,Total tocopherol levels in maize grain depend on chlorophyll biosynthesis within the embryo.,"Background: Tocopherols are a class of lipid-soluble compounds that have multiple functional roles in plants and exhibit vitamin E activity, an essential nutrient for human and animal health. The tocopherol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across the plant kingdom, but source of the key tocopherol pathway precursor, phytol, is unclear. Two protochlorophyllide reductases (POR1 and POR2) were previously identified as loci controlling the natural variation of total tocopherols in maize grain, a non-photosynthetic tissue. POR1 and POR2 are key genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis yet the contribution of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway to tocopherol biosynthesis is still not understood. 

Results: We took two approaches to alter the activity of these two POR genes within kernel tissue, physiological treatments and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts, to determine the role of chlorophyll biosynthesis for tocopherol content. Since light is required for POR enzymatic activity, we imposed a dark treatment on developing kernels, which reduced chlorophyll a and tocopherols levels in embryo tissue by 92-99% and 87-90%, respectively, compared to the light treatment. In CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts, the levels of chlorophyll a and tocopherols in embryos of the por1 por2 double homozygous mutant were reduced by 98-100% and 76-83%, respectively, compared to WT. 

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that tocopherol synthesis in maize grain depends almost entirely on phytol derived from chlorophyll biosynthesis within the embryo. POR1 and POR2 activity play crucial roles in chlorophyll biosynthesis, underscoring the importance of POR alleles and their activity in the biofortification of vitamin E levels in non-photosynthetic grain of maize."
40082800,foliar senescence,Gene expression through comparative transcriptome analysis unravels the molecular mechanisms of fertilizer-induced hormonal regulation and leaf senescence in maize for enhanced yield in semiarid regions.,"Aims: Fertilizers can significantly influence leaf senescence and hormonal regulation, which in turn impacts crop yield. Despite significant advancements in understanding fertilizer effects on plant growth, the specific molecular mechanisms through which fertilizers influence hormonal regulation and leaf senescence, and subsequent impact on yield, remain underexplored. This study addresses this critical gap by examining transcriptional, physiological, and molecular mechanisms in the semiarid regions of rainfed spring maize under long-term fertilizers. 

Methods: Fertilizer treatments include no amendment (NA), inorganic fertilizer (CF), combined inorganic and organic fertilizer (SC), organic fertilizer (SM), and maize straw (MS) replicated three times. 

Results: The highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed under CF (3972) followed by SC (1949) in comparison to NA, showing a strong effect of inorganic fertilizer on gene expressions. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that numerous genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signaling, photosynthesis pathways, and metabolic pathways showed varied expressions of up- and downregulation. Genes involved in the ethylene, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and brassinosteroid pathways indicated their interaction and promoted leaf senescence, whereas those related to auxin and gibberellin pathways had minimal impact. In the ethylene pathway known to influence senescence, two ethylene receptor (ETR) genes (Zm00001d013486 and Zm00001d021687) were downregulated, whereas, two ethylene-insensitive proteins 3 (EIN2) genes (Zm00001d053594 and Zm00001d033625) showed upregulation in the CF, SC and SM treatments. Furthermore, 86 highly up-regulated genes involved in the photosynthesis pathway encompassing components such as photosynthesis antenna, photosynthesis complexes II, cytochrome complexes, photosynthesis electron transport, and ATP complex in SC and CF compared to SM and MS. 

Conclusion: In summary, the study finds that DEGs showed stronger responses to inorganic fertilizers, likely due to organic fertilizers decomposing at a slower rate. Nevertheless, transcriptional and physiological analyses indicate that the SC treatment sustainably enhances maize productivity without causing adverse environmental effects, outperforming the other treatments (NA, CF, SM, MS). These results provide new perspectives on genetic regulation and pathway discovery in rainfed maize cultivation in semiarid areas."
40082805,drought response,GWAS and transcriptome analyses unravel ZmGRAS15 regulates drought tolerance and root elongation in maize.,"Background: Drought is a major abiotic stress affecting maize development and growth. Unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying maize drought tolerance and enhancing the drought tolerance of maize is of great importance. However, due to the complexity of the maize genome and the multiplicity of drought tolerance mechanisms, identifying the genetic effects of drought tolerance remains great challenging. 

Results: Using a mixed linear model (MLM) based on 362 maize inbred lines, we identified 40 associated loci and 150 candidate genes associated with survival rates. Concurrently, transcriptome analysis was conducted for five drought - tolerant and five drought - sensitive lines under Well-Watered (WW) and Water-Stressed (WS) conditions. Additionally, through co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified five modules significantly associated with the leaf relative water content (RWC) under drought treatment. By integrating the results of GWAS, DEGs, and WGCNA, four candidate genes (Zm00001d006947, Zm00001d038753, Zm00001d003429 and Zm00001d003553) significantly associated with survival rate were successfully identified. Among them, ZmGRAS15 (Zm00001d003553), a GRAS transcription factor considered as a key hub gene, was selected for further functional validation. The overexpression of ZmGRAS15 in maize could significantly enhance drought tolerance through regulating primary root length at the seedling stage. 

Conclusion: This study provides valuable information for understanding the genetic basis of drought tolerance and gene resources for maize drought tolerance breeding."
40084608,response to fall armyworm,"Deciphering the intricacies of chlorantraniliprole, azadirachtin and uniconazole interactions with fall armyworm in maize: a comprehensive analysis through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling.","Background: Maize is a critically important world staple food, yet its productivity is exposed to a notorious invasive pest of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). To discern the transgenerational effects and potential pest control efficacy, we evaluated chlorantraniliprole, azadirachtin, and uniconazole on S. frugiperda development, reproduction, metabolome, and larval transcriptome. 

Results: Exposure to chlorantraniliprole, azadirachtin, and uniconazole has impacted S. frugiperda larval development, pupation, fecundity, and longevity. Biochemical analysis of the specific enzyme activities [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and cytochrome P450 (P450)] showed a very high magnitude of activity changes. Chlorantraniliprole and azadirachtin had prominent influences on the expression of common genes involved in DNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation, digestion, immune reaction, and the endocrine system, as shown by RNA sequencing. In contrast, uniconazole affected gene regulation only marginally. Besides, the pesticides significantly affected the maize plants by altering their metabolome and transcriptome profiles and dramatically enhanced plant mortality, especially after chlorantraniliprole and azadirachtin treatments. RNA sequencing of maize plants treated with chlorantraniliprole, azadirachtin, and uniconazole revealed significant gene expression changes, providing insights into the plant's adaptive responses and potential alterations in insect-plant interactions. 

Conclusion: These results indicate complex, transgenerational effects of S. frugiperda itself and maize plants. These findings underline the potential of integrating these compounds into bio-intensive pest management strategies against S. frugiperda, with implications for enhancing maize protection."
40093605,response to salt,Salinity survival: molecular mechanisms and adaptive strategies in plants.,"Soil salinity is a significant environmental challenge that threatens plant growth and development, adversely affecting global food crop production. This underscores the critical need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying plant salt tolerance, which has profound implications for agricultural advancement. Recent progress in plant salt tolerance has greatly improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to salt stress and precision design breeding as an effective strategy for developing new salt-tolerant crop varieties. This review focuses on the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and important crops, namely, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), and rice (Oryza sativa). It summarizes current knowledge on plant salt tolerance, emphasizing key aspects such as the perception and response to salt stress, Na+ transport, Na+ compartmentalization and clearance, changes in reactive oxygen species induced by salt stress, and regulation of plant stem cell development under salt stress conditions. The review might provide new and valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of plant response and adaptation to salt stress."
40098499,response to salt,Advances in deciphering the mechanisms of salt tolerance in Maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a vital crop worldwide, serving as a cornerstone for food security, livestock feed, and biofuel production. However, its cultivation is increasingly jeopardized by environmental challenges, notably soil salinization, which severely constrains growth, yield, and quality. To combat salinity stress, maize employs an array of adaptive mechanisms, including enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and modulated plant hormone levels, which work synergistically to maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and ion homeostasis. This review explores the intricate interactions among ROS, antioxidant systems, plant hormones, and ion regulation in maize under salt stress, providing a comprehensive understanding of the physiological and molecular basis of its tolerance. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study contributes to the development of salt-tolerant maize varieties and informs innovative strategies to sustain agricultural productivity under adverse environmental conditions, offering significant theoretical insights into plant stress biology and practical solutions for achieving sustainable agriculture amidst global climate challenges."
40102048,drought response,Maize mutants in miR394-regulated genes show improved drought tolerance.,"Water limitation represents one of the major threats to agricultural production, which often leads to drought stress and results in compromised growth, development and yield of crop species. Drought tolerance has been intensively studied in search of potential targets for molecular approaches to crop improvement. However, drought adaptive traits are complex, and our understanding of the physiological and genetic basis of drought tolerance is still incomplete. The miR394-LCR pathway is a conserved regulatory module shown to participate in several aspects of plant growth and development, including stress response. Here, we characterized the miR394 pathway in maize, which harbours two genetic loci producing an evolutionarily conserved mature zma-miR394 targeting two transcripts coding for F-Box proteins, named hereby ZmLCR1 and ZmLCR2. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the zma-MIR394B gene showed high tolerance to drought conditions compared to control plants. Moreover, analysis of the growth and development of single and double maize mutant plants in ZmLCR genes indicate that these mutations do not affect plant fitness when they grow in normal watering conditions, but mutants showed better survival than wild-type plants under water deprivation conditions. This increased drought tolerance is based on more efficient intrinsic water use, changes in root architecture and increased epicuticular wax content under water-limiting conditions. Our results indicate that the miR394-regulated ZmLCR genes are involved in drought stress tolerance and are remarkable candidates for maize crop improvement."
40105588,drought response,DSD1/ZmICEb regulates stomatal development and drought tolerance in maize.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) growth and yield are severely limited by drought stress worldwide. Stomata play crucial roles in transpiration and gas exchange and are thus essential for improving plant water-use efficiency (WUE) to help plants deal with the threat of drought. In this study, we characterized the maize dsd1 (decreased stomatal density 1) mutant, which showed defects in stomatal development, including guard mother cell differentiation, subsidiary cell formation and guard cell maturation. DSD1 encodes the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION b (ZmICEb) and is a homolog of ICE1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). DSD1/ZmICEb is expressed in stomatal file cells throughout stomatal development and plays a conserved role in stomatal development across maize and Arabidopsis. Mutations in DSD1/ZmICEb dramatically improved drought tolerance and WUE in maize and reduced yield losses under drought conditions. Therefore, DSD1/ZmICEb represents a promising candidate target gene for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in maize by manipulating stomatal density."
40111445,response to cold stress,ZmDREB1A Regulates myo-Inositol-1-phosphate Synthase 2 Controlling Maize Germination at Low Temperatures.,"Transcription factor DREB1A positively regulates plant chilling stress tolerance. However, its role in regulating seed germination at low temperatures has remained a mystery. Our research has unveiled that maize zmdreb1a mutant seeds exhibit decreased ZmMIPS2 expression and a lower germination percentage than the control under low temperatures. The overexpression of ZmDREB1A upregulated ZmMIPS2 expression, while the mutation of DRE motifs in the ZmMIPS2 promoter nullified the influence of ZmDREB1A on the target gene expression. In addition, we demonstrated that ZmDREB1A directly binds to the three DRE motifs in the promoter of ZmMIPS2 both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation has shown that maize zmmips2 mutant seeds are more sensitive, while ZmMIPS2 overexpressing seeds are more tolerant of low temperatures during seed germination. These findings could be applied to develop new crop varieties that are more resilient to low temperatures during the vulnerable germination phase."
40118015,response to heavy metals,Elucidating the interaction and toxicity of cadmium and cerium on the growth of maize seedlings: Insights from morpho-physiological and biochemical analysis.,"The exploitation of rare earth elements (REEs) is often accompanied by heavy metal contamination. However, our understanding regarding the growth responses of plants to the co-existence of REEs and heavy metals (HMs), remains limited. In this study, cerium (Ce) and cadmium (Cd) were selected as representatives of REEs and HMs to investigate their interactive effects on maize growth through multiple model analyses. The results revealed that both Cd and Ce induce oxidative injuries by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in a dose-dependent manner. Ce can enhance chlorophyll content while reducing leaf yellowing induced by Cd. The addition of 10 and 100 mg· L-1 Ce significantly increased the Chla content in 50 μM Cd sets by 52.2 % and 50.2 % compared to Cd50Ce0 treatment, respectively. Evaluation of the physiological and biochemical effect level index (PBELI) showed that the primary interaction mode of Cd and Ce was antagonism. The co-existence of Cd (50 μM) and Ce (100 mg· L-1) poses a higher ecological risk than Ce alone. These results demonstrated that combined exposure to Cd and Ce exhibited diverse effects in mitigating the inhibition of maize growth, thereby improving our understanding of phytotoxicity resulting from metal mixtures in the environment. 
Highlights: 
    •    Cd/Ce exposure increased the oxidative stress level of maize seedlings. 
    •    Ce alleviated Cd-induced leaf yellowing while enhancing chlorophyll content. 
    •    PBELI analysis quantified the antagonistic effects of Cd-Ce co-exposure. 
    •    50 μM Cd and 100 mg·L−1 Ce co-exposure elicited greater toxicity, but less than Cd alone."
40119273,grain moisture,Genetic dissection of maize grain moisture content and dehydration rate using high-density bin mapping in a recombinant inbred line population,"Maize (Zea mays L.) grain moisture content (GMC) at harvest is a key determinant of seed preservation, grain quality, and drying costs, with the grain dehydration rate (GDR) playing a critical role in determining GMC. This study focused on understanding the genetic basis of GDR by utilizing a recombinant inbred line population of 310 lines derived from PB80 and PHJ65, assessed across three environments with high-density SNP markers. A genetic linkage map spanning 1237.36 cM with 5235 bin markers was constructed, leading to the identification of 23 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with GMC and Area Under the Dry Down Curve (AUDDC) across multiple chromosomes, with several QTLs explaining over 10% of the phenotypic variance. Significant QTLs, including qGMC1.1, qGMC2.2, and qAUDDC2.2, were consistently detected across various environments and developmental stages. Transcriptomic analysis identified 21 candidate genes within these QTL regions, including key transcription factors and metabolism-related genes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the genetic control of GMC and GDR, may serve as a foundation for future breeding efforts in maize breeding to enhance mechanized production efficiency and reduce post-harvest drying costs."
40119660,recombination frequency,Chronic water-deficit stress may increase meiotic recombination in maize.,"Meiosis and recombination lead to gametes with novel combinations of genes as key processes in evolution and plant breeding. Numerous extrinsic factors have been reported to affect meiotic recombination of plants. The goal of this research was to identify simple, low-cost, and effective treatments that affect recombination in maize (Zea mays L.). The treatments, water-deficit stress and defoliation, were separately applied to two F1-generation genotypes, B73/Mo17 and Mo17/H99. The F1 plants were backcrossed to an inbred line to produce the backcross populations that were genotyped at microsatellite loci on chromosomes 1 and 10. Overall, 1271 crossovers were observed in the progeny of the water-stressed plants while 1092 were observed in the progeny of the non-stressed plants. The water-deficit treatment may have increased the rates of recombination in both F1 genotypes while the defoliation treatment was ineffective. 

Plain Language Summary: 
Plant gametes, cells that unite to make the next generation, carry chromosomes with new combinations of genes. Those chromosomes are important sources of genetic variation, a key driver of evolution and plant breeding. Herein, we describe a simple and low-cost method for increasing meiotic recombination in maize to produce a higher frequency of gametes that contain chromosomes with new combinations of genes. 

Core Ideas: 
    When plants make gametes, the cells that unite to create the next generation, the gametes contain some chromosomes with new combinations of genes made through the process of recombination. 
    The chromosomes with the new combinations of genes are important sources of genetic variation that drives evolution and plant breeding. 
    A simple and low-cost method for increasing the rate of recombination of maize is described."
40121726,response to low nitrogen,Effects of exogenous melatonin on growth and photosynthesis of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings under low nitrogen stress.,"Nitrogen plays an important role in plant growth and development. Melatonin (Mel) is involved in many physiological and biochemical reactions in plants, which can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. However, the mechanism of exogenous Mel in maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress is still unknown. This experiment adopts the method of sand culture, Zhengdan 958 was used as the experimental variety, and three nitrogen levels (5mmolL-1, 2mmolL-1, 0.1mmolL-1) and two Mel treatment conditions (no exogenous Mel and 1μmolL-1 exogenous Mel) were set up to explore the effects of exogenous Mel on the growth and photosynthesis of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress. The growth of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress was significantly inhibited. Exogenous melatonin (Mel) increased the shoot dry weight by 11.74 % and 17.57 % under mild and severe low nitrogen stress, respectively. It promoted root growth, enhanced nitrogen accumulation in the shoots, and improved the net photosynthetic rate of maize seedlings, with increases of 14.85 % and 24.77 % under mild and severe low nitrogen stress, respectively.Exogenous Mel improved the activity of the reaction centers in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), increased electron transport rates, thereby enhancing light energy conversion efficiency and allocating more light energy to photochemical reactions. Additionally, exogenous Mel effectively alleviated the photo-oxidative damage to the photosynthetic systems caused by low nitrogen stress. This study demonstrated that exogenous Mel could significantly mitigate the inhibitory effects of low nitrogen stress on maize seedling growth. 
Highlights: 
    •    Exogenous Mel promoted root growth and nitrogen accumulation of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress. 
    •    Exogenous Mel alleviated the damage of low nitrogen stress to the photosystem. 
    •    Exogenous Mel improve the photosynthetic capacity of maize seedlings under low nitrogen stress."
40123957,kernel type,Identification of maize kernel varieties based on interpretable ensemble algorithms.,"Introduction: Maize kernel variety identification is crucial for reducing storage losses and ensuring food security. Traditional single models show limitations in processing large-scale multimodal data. 

Methods: This study constructed an interpretable ensemble learning model for maize seed variety identification through improved differential evolutionary algorithm and multimodal data fusion. Morphological and hyperspectral data of maize samples were extracted and preprocessed, and three methods were used to screen features, respectively. The base learner of the Stacking integration model was selected using diversity and performance indices, with parameters optimized through a differential evolution algorithm incorporating multiple mutation strategies and dynamic adjustment of mutation factors and recombination rates. Shapley Additive exPlanation was applied for interpretable ensemble learning. 

Results: The HDE-Stacking identification model achieved 97.78% accuracy. The spectral bands at 784 nm, 910 nm, 732 nm, 962 nm, and 666 nm showed positive impacts on identification results. 

Discussion: This research provides a scientific basis for efficient identification of different corn kernel varieties, enhancing accuracy and traceability in germplasm resource management. The findings have significant practical value in agricultural production, improving quality management efficiency and contributing to food security assurance."
40127185,response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus; disease response; response to Cercospora,Diverse modes of gene action contribute to heterosis for quantitative disease resistance in maize.,"Disease resistance in plants can be conferred by single genes of large effect or by multiple genes each conferring incomplete resistance. The latter case, termed quantitative resistance, may be difficult for pathogens to overcome through evolution due to the low selection pressures exerted by the actions of any single gene and, for some diseases, is the only identified source of genetic resistance. We evaluated quantitative resistance to two diseases of maize in a bi-parental mapping population as well as backcrosses to both the parents. Quantitative trait locus analysis shows that the genetic architecture of resistance to these diseases is characterized by several modes of gene action including additivity as well as dominance, overdominance, and epistasis. Heterosis or hybrid vigor, the improved performance of a hybrid compared to its parents, can be caused by non-additive gene action and is fundamental to the breeding of several crops including maize. In the backcross populations and a diverse set of maize hybrids, we find heterosis for resistance in many cases and that the degree of heterosis appears to be dependent on both hybrid genotype and disease."
40141083,response to heat stress,Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Maize Seedlings Provides Insights into the Mechanisms of Heat-Stress Tolerance,"The dramatically high temperatures triggered by global climate change threaten maize growth and yield. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on the impacts of heat injury on maize. However, the molecular mechanisms behind maize’s adaptation to heat stress remain largely unexplored. To uncover how plants protect themselves from heat stress, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis on maize leaves by using multiplex iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic and LC-MS/MS methods. A total of 1594 phosphopeptides ascribed to 875 proteins were identified. A functional enrichment analysis of the proteins and phosphoproteins revealed that the early thermal responses of maize were associated with translational and post-translational modifications, protein turnover, and chaperone binding in the MAPK pathway. A motif analysis also yielded a significant number of potential MAPK substrates. The functional characterization of the phosphoproteins and pathways identified here will provide new insights for improving crop thermal tolerance."
40158480,response to heavy metals,"Phosphorus and sulphur crosstalk in cereals: Unraveling the molecular interplay, agronomic impacts on yield and heavy metal tolerance.","Phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S) are essential macronutrients for crop growth, playing critical roles in physiological and biochemical processes throughout the plant life cycle, as well as in mitigating heavy metal and metalloid toxicity. Therefore, the coordinated use of P and S is crucial for optimizing crop growth and reducing the accumulation of heavy metals and metalloids in plants. While P and S signaling pathways are often studied independently, our understanding of their interactions remains limited. A series of recent studies have revealed key components regulating P-S interactions in cereal crops such as rice, maize and wheat, providing new insights into the network that integrates the signaling pathways of P and S. However, the interaction between P and S in molecular regulatory pathways, crop yield improvement, and resistance to heavy metal stress has not yet been systematically summarized or hypothesized. Here, we summarize the latest advances in P-S interactions and propose potential working mechanisms that integrate these P-S interactive regulatory pathways in cereal crops. Furthermore, we discuss the regulatory mechanisms of P-S interactions in cereal crops that still need to be uncovered in the future. 
Highlights: 
    •The interactive effects of P and S vary in different cereals and tissues. 
    •The transportation and signal transduction of P and S are interdependent and have interactive effects on each other 
    •P and S may have synergistic effects in regulating the heavy metal resistance in cereals."
40159933,Abiotic stress response,Interplay between auxin and abiotic stresses in maize.,"Plants display a continuum of responses to abiotic stresses, including sensitivity and tolerance. Classical phytohormones have been implicated in these processes due to the observed changes in growth phenotypes following stress cues. This interplay is often described as the growth-stress tradeoff. Recent studies have examined abiotic stress responses in maize and implicated auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. However, very few auxin pathway genes have been functionally characterized for their role in stress responses in maize, leaving a large knowledge gap in the field. In this review we will describe our current understanding of relationships between auxin and a myriad of stresses, including temperature, drought, salinity, light, and heavy metals. Resilience to environmental stresses is critical for informing agricultural strategies to improve maize yield and quality. We conclude with a discussion of possible future directions and approaches that may increase our understanding how auxin mediates growth-stress tradeoffs in maize."
40162687,response to flooding; response to fall armyworm,Flood-Induced Insect Resistance in Maize Involves Flavonoid-Dependent Salicylic Acid Induction.,"Plants have evolved the ability to respond to a diverse range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Often, combining these stresses multiplies the challenge for the plants, but occasionally the combined stress can induce unexpected synergistic defences. In maize, combined flooding and herbivory induces a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defence against Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). In this study we used RNAseq and metabolic profiling to show that flavonoids are involved in maize response to combined flooding and herbivory. To assess the role of flavonoids in flood-induced S. frugiperda resistance, we analyzed the maize idf mutant that has compromised expression of chalcone synthase, the first enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. This flavonoid-deficient mutant was compromised both in flood-induced S. frugiperda resistance and in SA accumulation. These data revealed an unexpected requirement for flavonoids in SA induction. In contrast to idf, the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase mutant, pr1, showed enhanced SA accumulation after combinatorial treatment, which closely correlated with elevated levels of select flavonoids and the dihydroflavonol reductase, anthocyaninless1 (a1) mutant, was unaffected in its SA-induction. These data indicate that specific flavonoids likely play a role in flood-induced SA accumulation and S. frugiperda resistance."
40164830,ear development,Siblicide between fertilized and unfertilized ovaries within the maize ear,"Evolutionarily, plants overproduce ovaries but selectively eliminate those inferiors to ensure competitive offspring to set. This sibling rivalry, reducing grain number, is detrimental agronomically. However, the interaction between early-fertilized and unfertilized ovaries in sequentially-pollinated panicles is unclear. Here, we fertilized the ovaries on half rows of maize ear (HP) while keeping the rest unfertilized to investigate their interaction. HP reduced the growth of unfertilized ovaries while promoting fertilized ovary (grain) development. 13C-isotope labeling of grains led to isotope signal detected in the unlabeled ovaries, validating their interactions. Transcriptionally, HP caused cell wall degradation and senescence of unfertilized ovaries, reducing their viability. These ovaries showed promoted auxin and jasmonic acid levels with activated auxin signaling but suppressed MAPK signaling. Conversely, HP grains activated MAPK signaling, sugar utilization, and cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that grains suppress ovaries in ear to consolidate sugar utilization advantage for development, potentially through hormone and MAPK signaling."
40169419,plant height,Integrative mapping in large inbred and hybrid association panels along with an F2 population advanced a novel understanding of general combining ability for plant height in maize.,"We identified 44 QTL for PH-related traits evaluated for inbreds per se and GCA effects in large inbred and hybrid association panels and seven QTL for EH/PH in an F2 population coupled with BSA-seq. Among four co-localized QTL, seven novel potential candidate genes were significantly associated with PH-related traits, shedding new light on understanding the genetics of GCA for PH. Breeding optimal plant height (PH) is essential for improving maize (Zea mays L.) plant architecture, yield, lodging resistance, and density tolerance, yet there is limited genetic loci available regarding the general combining ability (GCA) for PH-related traits. In the current study, an inbred association panel of 312 inbred lines (IAP) along with a hybrid association panel (HAP) of 764 hybrid combinations were utilized to dissect the genetics of PH-related traits and their GCA effects across three environments. We found 44 quantitative trait loci (QTL) with 76 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for PH-related traits evaluated for inbreds per se and GCA effects; however, no overlapping loci were identified across inbreds per se and GCA effects, indicating conspicuous discrepancies in their genetics. In addition, GCA effects with complex genetic basis differed for diverse testers, which highlighted the specificity and complexity among heterotic groups. Correspondingly, we evaluated an F2 population derived from two parental lines LY-02 and LH513 with the contrasting EH/PH coupled with bulked segregant analysis by sequencing (BSA-seq) and found seven QTL for EH/PH. Among four co-localized loci across the association and QTL mapping, seven novel candidate genes were found to differently express among LY-02, LH513, and their F1 and were potentially associated with PH-related traits. The current study with combined mapping in diverse mapping populations provided a novel understanding of GCA for PH-related traits in maize."
40173045,response to Exserohilum turcicum,The Exserohilum turcicum effector EtEC81 reprograms alternative splicing in maize and activates immunity,"Some pathogen-derived effectors reprogram mRNA splicing in host plants to regulate plant immune responses. Whether effectors from Exserohilum turcicum, which causes northern corn leaf blight (NLB), interfere with RNA splicing remains unknown. We identify that the secreted protein EtEC81 (Exserohilum turcicum effector 81) modulates the alternative splicing (AS) of maize (Zea mays) pre-mRNAs and negatively regulates the pathogenicity of E. turcicum. EtEC81 physically interacts with MAIZE EtEC81-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (ZmEIP1), which associates with maize spliceosome components, modulates AS in host cells, and positively regulates defense responses against E. turcicum. Transcriptome analysis identifies 119 common events with altered AS in maize plants transiently overexpressing ZmEIP1 or EtEC81, suggesting that these factors cause the misregulation of cellular activities and thus induce immune responses. Together, our results suggest that the EtEC81 effector targets ZmEIP1 to reprogram pre-mRNA splicing in maize. These findings provide a mechanistic basis and potential target gene for preventing NLB. 
Highlights: 
    •    EtEC81 modulates alternative splicing in the plant nucleus 
    •    EtEC81 triggers plant immune responses to restrict pathogen infection 
    •    EtEC81 targets ZmEIP1 to reprogram pre-mRNA splicing in maize 
    •    ZmEIP1 positively regulates immune responses by participating in pre-mRNA splicing"
40175858,response to fall armyworm; response to corn leaf aphid; response to Cochliobolus heterostrophus,The herbivore-inducible coumarate-CoA ligase 5 (Zm4CL5) in maize contributes to the production of non-lignin phenylpropanoids.,"Maize coumarate-CoA ligase gene expression is differentially regulated by different biotic stresses, and Zm4CL5 is induced by fall armyworm herbivory and impacts plant growth. The phenylpropanoid pathway is important for the synthesis of numerous compounds involved in plant growth and stress resilience, including lignin and flavonoids. The last common step in the core phenylpropanoid pathway is the enzyme 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL). Maize (Zea mays) has five 4CL genes, four of which (Zm4CL1-4) are type I (lignin-associated 4CLs), while one (Zm4CL5) is a type II (non-lignin-associated 4CL). In maize, it is not known which, if any, 4CL genes are involved in plant defense. Here we show that infection with the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus alters the expression of the type I genes, while herbivory by Spodoptera frugiperda induces the type II gene Zm4CL5. A knock-down mutant of Zm4CL5 displayed altered accumulation of flavonoids and other non-lignin phenylpropanoids, as well as increased plant height, revealing a role for Zm4CL5 both in plant growth and in non-lignin phenylpropanoid production. These data indicate that 4CL genes in maize play differential roles in growth and in the defense against different biotic stressors."
40181321,phytic acid level; phosphorus content,Phytic acid is an available phosphorus source for maize plants in juvenile phase belonging to two populations with different breeding backgrounds.,"Background: Applying animal effluent/digestate to forage crops can improve the sustainability of intensive livestock husbandry. Organic phosphorus (P) forms, in particular phytic acid (InsP6) present in animal effluent/digestate, would benefit from an effective uptake and assimilation by crops thus representing an alternative to mineral P fertilization and controlling P losses in water system. A maize (Zea mays L.) traditional Italian population (VA572), bred before the widespread diffusion of crop chemical fertilization, and a modern commercial hybrid (P1547) were used in this study to investigate their ability of growing in soilless medium using phytic acid (Po) vs phosphate P (Pi) as P sources in a 28-day experiment. The hypothesis was that the different agronomical context in which the two varieties were selected could have brought to different abilities in exploiting P sources for plant growth. 

Results: Quantitative and qualitative growth parameters, root enzymatic phosphatase activities and root transcriptome by RNA-seq analysis were analyzed in this study. Both maize populations were able to grow using phytic acid as the sole P source but organic P utilization was less efficient than Pi; a significant root-released phytase activity, induced by the presence of InsP6, was detected in Po treatment. The RNA-seq analysis showed different expression patterns induced by organic P treatment (Po) in the two populations. The upregulation in Po treatment of a Purple Acid Phosphatase (PAP) gene and of genes involved in inositol transport indicate that both phosphate hydrolysis from InsP6 by root-secreted PAPs and a direct uptake of myo-inositol at various degrees of phosphorylation could be involved in maize phytic acid exploitation. Root system development and the relationship of P sources with other macro and micro nutrient uptake (N, K, metal ions) were also implied in the response to Po treatment. 

Conclusions: This study indicates that phytic acid is a bioavailable P source for maize seedling growth. A wider mobilization of genes/pathways was induced by Po treatment in VA572 with respect to P1547 hybrid. The physiological responses to Po treatment were similar in both populations but the patterns of genes involved often differed being specific to each one."
6092861,response to foxtail mosaic virus; response to barley stripe mosaic virus,Mutations of the Adh1 gene in maize following infection with barley stripe mosaic virus,"Mutations at the Adh1 locus in maize were selected from plants infected with barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV). Pollen from the infected inbred line 1s2p, which is homozygous for Adh1-S (abbreviated S), Adh2-P, c and r was treated with allyl alcohol and applied to silks of a tester stock homozygous for Adh1-F, Adh2-N, C and R. From these pollinations 356 kernels arose on the F1 ears. Of these eight showed no activity of the S allele in scutellar samples while two exhibited low levels. Five of the putative mutant kernels germinated and two of these contained the contamination markers Adh2-P, c and r. The newly arisen mutations were designated S5446 and S5453. S5453 exhibited an abnormally low level of ADH activity in the F1 scutellum. In the F2 generation the mutant reverted at a high frequency with only about 5% of the S5453 alleles expressing low levels. DNA blotting and hybridization analyses showed no alterations in the restriction patterns of S5453 when compared to the progenitor S allele. S5446 which exhibited no ADH activity in the F1 scutellum is unstable in the pollen; reversion frequencies approaching 10(-2) were observed in samples from some plants. Restriction digestion patterns of DNA from this mutant revealed the presence of a 3.3 kb insertion at Adh. The insert does not appear to contain sequences homologous to the BSMV genome but rigorous analyses remain to be carried out. It is hypothesized that BSMV infection may mobilize endogenous but dormant transposable elements in maize."
7418006,response to flooding,The anaerobic proteins of maize,"Anaerobic treatment drastically alters the pattern of protein synthesized by maize primary roots. During the first hour of anaerobiosis, aerobic protein synthesis is halted and there is an increase in the synthesis of a class of polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 33,000 daltons. During the second hour of anaerobic treatment, the synthesis of another small group of polypeptides is initated. This group, the anerboic polypeptides (ANPs), accounts for > 70% of total protein synthesis after 5 hr of anaerobiosis, and is synthesized in basically the same ratio until root death (approximately 70 hr). The alcohol dehydrogenase polypeptides are major ANPs. RNA isolated from roots treated anaerobically for at least 24 hr directs the translation of only the anaerobic polypeptides. However, RNA from roots treated anaerobically for only 5 hr directs translation of both anaerobic and aerobic polypeptides. Thus an early response to anaerobic treatment is the suppression of aerobic message translation. Although the anaerobic polypeptides share a formal similarity to heat-shock proteins in animals, it is probable that the anaerobic genes are an adaptation to flooding."
7518090,response to flooding,Involvement of intracellular calcium in anaerobic gene expression and survival of maize seedlings,"Ca-mediated processes are known to be involved in transducing many developmental, hormonal, and environmental cues in plant cells. In this study, the role of Ca in the perception of anoxic stress signals by maize (Zea mays L. cv B73) roots was assessed by studying the effect of various Ca antagonists on the induction of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and sucrose synthase mRNA as well as ADH activity under anoxia. The effect of these compounds on the poststress recovery of the seedlings was also monitored. Ruthenium red (RR), an inhibitor of organellar Ca fluxes, repressed the anoxic activation of the alcohol dehydrogenase1 and shrunken1 genes as measured by their transcript levels as well as ADH activity. Furthermore, RR-treated seedlings could not recover even after only 2 h of flooding, in contrast to untreated B73 seedlings that survived 72 h of submergence. Ca, when supplied along with RR, allowed normal anoxic gene expression and also prevented the RR-imposed death of the seedlings from short-term anoxia. Ca (45Ca) fluxes were measured in maize roots to elucidate the mode of action of RR. RR abolished anoxia-stimulated 45Ca influx into maize roots but did not affect aerobic Ca2+ uptake, unlike a few other antagonists that blocked both the aerobic and anoxic fluxes. However, Ca uptake across the plasma membrane was not necessary for the adaptive response to anoxia, since chelation of extracellular Ca by ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid did not affect the induction of ADH activity or poststress survival of flooded seedlings."
7521796,male fertility,Translation in a wheat germ cell-free system of RNA from mitochondria of the normal and Texas male-sterile cytoplasms of maize (Zea mays L.),"RNA isolated from etiolated seedling shoot mitochondria of maize (Zea mays L.) with normal (N) or Texas male-sterile (T) cytoplasm stimulated the incorporation of [35S]-methionine into protein when added to a cell-free protein-synthesizing system from wheat germ. Discrete polypeptides with molecular masses of up to approximately 67 kDa were synthesized, and the pattern of bands was distinct from that obtained with total RNA. Products of translation of T-urf13 RNA were identified by immunoprecipitation, and of atpA, coxI, and coxII RNA by hybrid arrest of translation by the cloned gene. Several polypeptides were differentially synthesized from N and T mitochondrial RNA; these differences were more extensive than those found when isolated, intact, N and T mitochondria are allowed to synthesize proteins."
7599317,protein synthesis,Synthesis of ribosomal proteins from stored mRNAs early in seed germination,"In several eukaryotic organisms the mRNA expression for ribosomal proteins (RPs) is highly regulated at the translational level. The present work addresses the synthesis of RPs early in germination and particularly the origin of their transcripts. Excised maize axes were labeled with [35S]methionine for 6 h, and both cytoplasmic and ribosomal proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and fluorography. It was found that some RPs are newly synthesized and already incorporated into ribosomes during this period. Synthesis of RPs was also observed under conditions of transcription inhibition, suggesting the presence of stored-RP transcripts in the embryonic axes. In vitro translation of polysomes isolated from alpha-amanitin-treated axes early in germination (3 and 9 h) was performed. Immunoprecipitation of the products revealed the synthesis of rps. Four heterologous probes two each of the small subunit (S4 and S6) and large (L3, L16) subunit rps were used to detect the correspondent transcripts within the stored mRNA stock of the embryonic axes. Both, by slot blot and northern analysis, a positive cross-reaction occurred for all the tested samples. Although only two of them (S4 and S6) seem to be stored as mature mRNA."
7632354,huitlacoche production,"Huitlacoche (Ustilago maydis) as a food source - Biology, composition, and production","Huitlacoche is the ethnic name applied to the young fruiting bodies (galls) of the fungus Ustilago maydis, which causes common smut of maize (Zea mays L). Biologists and agronomists have historically used U. maydis as a model to study a wide array of genetic, physiological, ecological, and phytopathological phenomena. In Mexico and other Latin American countries, huitlacoche has been used traditionally as human food, being highly regarded as an interesting dish or condiment. The food potential of huitlacoche is described here in terms of its chemical composition, which includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, essential amino acids (especially lysine) and fatty acids (linoleate) are present in huitlacoche in considerable levels, adding to its nutritional attributes. The feasibility of growing U. maydis in submerged agitated culture has yielded a variety of fermentation products, including essential amino acids, proteins, vitamins, and flavorings, among others. Recent interest in developing huitlacoche as a cash crop has come from increasing acceptance by the North American public, who prize it as a new delicacy. However, research efforts are still needed to determine the biological factors involved in the establishment of U. maydis as a pathogen on the maize plant. This review deals with the role of huitlacoche as a food source, implicating the biological components that will determine the development of technologies for large scale production."
7679774,male fertility; response to methomyl,Mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast expressing the cytoplasmic male sterility t-urf13 gene from maize - analysis at the population and individual cell level,"The urf13TW gene, which is derived from the mitochondrial T-urf13 gene responsible for Texas cytoplasmic male sterility in maize, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by targeting its translation product into mitochondria. Analysis by oxygraphy at the population level revealed that in the presence of methomyl the oxygen uptake of intact yeast cells carrying the targeted protein is strongly stimulated only with ethanol as respiratory substrate and not with glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, or acetate. When malate is the substrate oxidized by isolated mitochondria, interaction between the targeted protein and methomyl results in significant inhibition of oxygen uptake. This inhibition is eliminated and oxygen uptake is stimulated by subsequent addition of NAD+. Using 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] as probe, interactive laser scanning and flow cytometry, which permit analysis at the individual cell level, demonstrated that specific staining of the mitochondrial compartment is obtained and that DiOC6(3) fluorescence serves as a measure of the membrane potential. Finally, it was shown that, as in T cytoplasm maize mitochondria, HmT toxin and methomyl dissipate the membrane potential of yeast mitochondria that carry the foreign protein. Furthermore, the results suggest that the HmT toxin and methomyl response is related to the plasmid copy number per cell and that the deleterious effect induced by HmT toxin is stronger than that of methomyl."
7683257,embryogenesis; response to heat stress; microspore development,"Characterization of two maize HSP90 heat shock protein genes: expression during heat shock, embryogenesis, and pollen development.","We have isolated two genes from Zea mays encoding proteins of 82 and 81 kD that are highly homologous to the Drosophila 83-kD heat shock protein gene and have analyzed the structure and pattern of expression of these two genes during heat shock and development. Southern blot analysis and hybrid select translations indicate that the highly homologous hsp82 and hsp81 genes are members of a small multigene family composed of at least two and perhaps three or more gene family members. The deduced amino acid sequence of these proteins based on the nucleotide sequence of the coding regions shows 64-88% amino acid homology to other hsp90 family genes from human, yeast, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis. The promoter regions of both the hsp82 and hsp81 genes contain several heat shock elements (HSEs), which are putative binding sites for heat shock transcription factor (HSF) commonly found in the promoters of other heat shock genes. Gene-specific oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used to examine the mRNA expression patterns of the hsp81 and hsp82 genes during heat shock, embryogenesis, and pollen development. The hsp81 gene is only mildly heat inducible in leaf tissue, but is strongly expressed in the absence of heat shock during the pre-meiotic and meiotic prophase stages of pollen development and in embryos, as well as in heat-shocked embryos and tassels. The hsp82 gene shows strong heat inducibility at heat-shock temperatures (37-42 degrees C) and in heat shocked embryos and tassels but is only weakly expressed in the absence of heat shock. Promoter-GUS reporter gene fusions made and analyzed by transient expression assays in Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) Maize protoplasts also indicate that the hsp82 and hsp81 are regulated differentially. The hsp82 promoter confers strong heat-inducible expression of the GUS reporter gene in heat-treated cells (60- to 80-fold over control levels), whereas the hsp81 promoter is only weakly heat inducible (5- to 10-fold over control levels)."
7721743,response to cold stress,A post-translational modification of the photosystem II subunit CP29 protects maize from cold stress,"The resistance of maize plants to cold stress has been associated with the appearance of a new chlorophyll a/b binding protein in the thylakoid membrane following chilling treatment in the light. The cold-induced protein has been isolated, characterized by amino acid sequencing, and pulse labeled with radioactive precursors, showing that it is the product of post-translational modification by phosphorylation of the minor chlorophyll a/b protein CP29 rather than the product of a cold-regulated gene or an unprocessed CP29 precursor. We show here that the CP29 kinase activity displays unique characteristics differing from previously described thylakoid kinases and is regulated by the redox state of a quinonic site. Finally, we show that maize plants unable to perform phosphorylation have enhanced sensitivity to cold-induced photoinhibition."
7732374,disease response,Molecular genetics of plant disease resistance,Plant breeders have used disease resistance genes (R genes) to control plant disease since the turn of the century. Molecular cloning of R genes that enable plants to resist a diverse range of pathogens has revealed that the proteins encoded by these genes have several features in common. These findings suggest that plants may have evolved common signal transduction mechanisms for the expression of resistance to a wide range of unrelated pathogens. Characterization of the molecular signals involved in pathogen recognition and of the molecular events that specify the expression of resistance may lead to novel strategies for plant disease control.
7748162,gravitropism,Root gravitropism,"When a plant root is reoriented within the gravity field, it responds by initiating a curvature which eventually results in vertical growth. Gravity sensing occurs primarily in the root tip. It may involve amyloplast sedimentation in the columella cells of the root cap, or the detection of forces exerted by the mass of the protoplast on opposite sides of its cell wall. Gravisensing activates a signal transduction cascade which results in the asymmetric redistribution of auxin and apoplastic Ca2+ across the root tip, with accumulation at the bottom side. The resulting lateral asymmetry in Ca2+ and auxin concentration is probably transmitted to the elongation zone where differential cellular elongation occurs until the tip resumes vertical growth. The Cholodny-Went theory proposes that gravity-induced auxin redistribution across a gravistimulated plant organ is responsible for the gravitropic response. However, recent data indicate that the gravity-induced reorientation is more complex, involving both auxin gradient-dependent and auxin gradient-independent events."
7764246,response to maize chlorotic mottle virus; response to maize dwarf mosaic virus,Transgenic corn plants expressing MDMV strain-B coat protein are resistant to mixed infections of maize dwarf mosaic virus and maize chlorotic mottle virus,"The maize dwarf mosaic virus strain B (MDMV-B) coat protein (cp) gene was cloned into a monocot expression cassette and introduced into sweet corn cell suspension cultures via particle bombardment or electroporation. Transformed cells were selected on culture media containing 300 mg/l kanamycin, and plants were regenerated. Cells from all transformed lines expressed the cp gene; and one transgenic line synthesized approximately 100-200 micrograms MDMV-cp per gram fresh weight. Plants regenerated from this line were challenged with a virus inoculum concentration adjusted to produce symptoms in nontransgenic controls at six days post inoculation. In growth chamber studies, the presence of the MDMV-cp provided resistance to inoculations with MDMV-A or MDMV-B and to mixed inoculations of MDMV and maize chlorotic mottle virus."
7808391,pollen thermotolerance,Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for pollen thermotolerance detected in maize,"Pollen thermotolerance is an important component of the adaptability of crops to high temperature stress. The tolerance level of the different genotypes in a population of 45 maize recombinant inbred lines was determined as the degree of injury caused by high temperature to pollen germinability (IPGG) and pollen tube growth (IPTG) in an in vitro assay. Both traits revealed quantitative variability and high heritability. The traits were genetically dissected by the analysis of molecular markers using 184 mapped restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Significant genetic correlation between the markers and the trait allowed us to identify a minimum number of five qualitative trait loci (QTLs) for IPGG and six QTLs for IPTG. Their chromosomal localization indicated that the two characters are controlled by different sets of genes. In addition, IPGG and IPTG were shown to be basically independent of the pollen germination ability and pollen tube growth rate under non-stress conditions. These results are discussed in relation to their possible utilization in a breeding strategy for the improvement of thermotolerance in maize."
7874742,response to methomyl; cytoplasmic male sterility,"MRG1-1, a dominant allele that confers methomyl resistance in yeast expressing the cytoplasmic male sterility T-urf13 gene from maize","We have previously described a eukaryotic heterologous expression system, with the urf13TW gene in yeast, which mimics the disease susceptibility associated with the Texas cytoplasmic male sterility in maize. This yeast model was used to isolate yeast nuclear mutants conferring methomyl resistance. The genetic strategy we have developed focused on screening for nuclear dominant yeast mutations which restore methomyl resistance. MRG1-1, a yeast nuclear dominant allele, was identified as a methomyl-resistance restorer. We have shown that methomyl resistance co-segregated with a pleiotropic phenotype in the heterozygous MRG1-1/MRG1 diploids, detectable even in the absence of the maize-derived mitochondrial protein and/or methomyl. We observed an increase in oxygen uptake, a significant decrease of the levels of cytochrome aa3, and a decrease in the growth yield. This phenotype is influenced by the carbon source and the results suggest a defect in the adaptation to the respiratory pathway in MRG1-1 yeast cells."
7881913,fertilization,Isolation and microinjection of active sperm nuclei into egg cells and central cells of isolated maize embryo sacs,Artificial fertilisation was attempted in maize by microinjecting sperm nuclei into the egg cell or central cell of isolated embryo sacs. A protocol for isolation of nuclei from pollen grains was developed and a pure fraction of sperm nuclei was obtained after centrifugation on a Percoll gradient. The in vitro transcriptional activity of the nuclei was tested by incorporation of radioactive UTP into RNA. The level of labelled nucleotide incorporation increased and reached a maximum after between 30 and 40 min in the incubation medium. The embryo sacs were enzymatically isolated and their viability determined by observation of cytoplasmic streaming in the female cells. The embryo sacs were immobilised by embedding in low-melting-point agarose and a single male nucleus was injected with a bevelled microcapillary. The presence of the injected nucleus in the egg or central cell was demonstrated using a cytological approach. This paper presents an alternative method for studying the intimate processes of fertilisation in plants.
7887628,response to Fusarium seedling blight; fumonisin content,Genetic analysis of fumonisin production and virulence of Gibberella fujikuroi mating population a (Fusarium moniliforme) on maize (Zea mays) seedlings,"The phytopathogenic fungus Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A (anamorph, Fusarium moniliforme) produces fumonisins, which are toxic to a wide range of plant and animal species. Previous studies of field strains have identified a genetic locus, designated fum1, that can determine whether fumonisins are produced. To test the relationship between fumonisin production and virulence on maize seedlings, a cross between a fum1+ field strain that had a high degree of virulence and a fum1- field strain that had a low degree of virulence was made, and ascospore progeny were scored for these traits. Although a range of virulence levels was recovered among the progeny, high levels of virulence were associated with production of fumonisins, and highly virulent, fumonisin-nonproducing progeny were not obtained. A survey of field strains did identify a rare fumonisin-nonproducing strain that was quite high in virulence. Also, the addition of purified fumonisin B1 to virulence assays did not replicate all of the seedling blight symptoms obtained with autoclaved culture material containing fumonisin. These results support the hypothesis that fumonisin plays a role in virulence but also indicate that fumonisin production is not necessary or sufficient for virulence on maize seedlings."
7901750,response to Gibberella stalk rot,Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to Gibberella zeae infection in maize,"The basic prerequisite for an efficient breeding program to improve levels of resistance to pathogens in plants is the identification of genes controlling the resistance character. If the response to pathogens is under the control of a multilocus system, the utilization of molecular markers becomes essential. Stalk and ear rot caused by Gibberella zeae is a widespread disease of corn: resistance to G. zeae is quantitatively inherited. Our experimental approach to understanding the genetic basis of resistance to Gibberella is to estimate the genetic linkage between available molecular markers and the character, measured as the amount of diseased tissue 40 days after inoculation of a suspension of Fusarium graminearum, the conidial form of G. zeae, into the first stalk internode. Sensitive and resistant parental inbreds were crossed to obtain F1 and F2 populations: the analysis of the segregation of 95 RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) clones and 10 RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers was performed on a population of 150 F2 individuals. Analysis of resistance was performed on the F3 families obtained by selfing the F2 plants. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection was based either on analysis of regression coefficients between family mean value and allele values in the F2 population, or by means of interval mapping, using MAPMAKER-QTL. A linkage map of maize was obtained, in which four to five genomic regions are shown to carry factors involved in the resistance to G. zeae."
7911693,"protein content, kernel; protein content, coleoptile",Mapping factors controlling genetic expression,"A methodology relying on two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and genetic mapping is proposed to dissect the genetic architecture of the quantitative control of gene products. Seventy-two anonymous polypeptide spots resolved using silver-stained high-resolution 2D gels of maize coleoptile extracts were automatically quantified for every individual of an F2 progeny between distant lines. A complete genetic linkage map, including 70 RFLP and 39 protein markers, allowed us to map Mendelian factors underlying quantitative variation for 42 polypeptides. One to 5 unlinked chromosomal regions were found to affect single polypeptides, 27% of which resulted in more than a doubling of the polypeptide spot intensity. Dominance was observed for half of the factors, with high amount dominant over low amount in most cases, which is consistent with the observation that the relative abundance of proteins in F1 hybrids is in average deviated to the high parental values. Epistatic interactions were shown to be involved in the control of 14% of the proteins. These features contrast sharply with the observations from 20 agromorphological traits measured in the same progeny, where limited substitution and dominance effects, and no epistatic interaction, were found."
7911770,cytoplasmic male sterility,"Recovery of heritable, transposon-induced, mutant alleles of the rf2 nuclear restorer of T-cytoplasm maize","T (Texas) cytoplasm is associated with a mitochondrial disruption that is phenotypically expressed during microsporogenesis resulting in male sterility. Restoration of pollen fertility in T-cytoplasm maize is controlled by dominant alleles at two unlinked, complementary, nuclear-encoded genes, rf1 and rf2. As a first step in the molecular isolation of the rf2 gene, 178,300 gametes derived from plants that carried the Mutator, Cy or Spm transposon families were screened for rf2 mutant alleles (rf2-m) via their inability to restore pollen fertility to T-cytoplasm male-sterile maize. Seven heritable rf2-m alleles were recovered from these transposon populations. Pedigrees and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based analyses indicated that all seven rf 2-m alleles were derived independently. The ability to obtain rf 2-m derivatives from Rf2 suggests that Rf2 alleles produce a functional product necessary to restore pollen fertility to cmsT. Molecular markets flanking the rf1 and rf2 loci were used to decipher segregation patterns in progenies segregating for the rf2-m alleles. These analyses provided preliminary evidence of a weak, third restorer gene of cmsT that can substitute for Rf1."
7914503,"electrophoretic mobility, SDS-PAGE; protein content, coleoptile",Quantitative trait loci underlying gene product variation: a novel perspective for analyzing regulation of genome expression,"A methodology to dissect the genetic architecture of quantitative variation of numerous gene products simultaneously is proposed. For each individual of a segregating progeny, proteins extracted from a given organ are separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis, and their amounts are estimated with a computer-assisted system for spot quantification. Provided a complete genetic map is available, statistical procedures allow determination of the number, effects and chromosomal locations of factors controlling the amounts of individual proteins. This approach was applied to anonymous proteins of etiolated coleoptiles of maize, in an F2 progeny between two distant lines. The genetic map included both restriction fragment length polymorphism and protein markers. Minimum estimates of one to five unlinked regulatory factors were found for 42 of the 72 proteins analyzed, with a large diversity of effects. Dominance and epistasis interactions were involved in the control of 38% and 14% of the 72 proteins, respectively. Such a methodology might help understanding the architecture of regulatory networks and the possible adaptive or phenotypic significance of the polymorphism of the genes involved."
7920708,wound response; disease response,Expression of a maize proteinase inhibitor gene is induced in response to wounding and fungal infection: systemic wound-response of a monocot gene,"The isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic clones encoding a proteinase inhibitor protein (MPI) in maize is reported. Accumulation of the MPI mRNA is induced in response to fungal infection in germinating maize embryos. The expression pattern of the MPI gene, in healthy and fungal infected maize tissues, was examined and compared with the expression pattern of a gene that codes for a pathogenesis-related protein (the PRms protein) from maize. These two genes are induced by fungal infection, however different signals trigger their activation. Accumulation of the proteinase inhibitor mRNA is more a consequence of the wound produced by the penetration and colonization of the host tissues by the pathogen, than the result of a direct molecular recognition of the pathogen by the plant, as is the case for the induction of the PRms gene. Wounding, or treatment with abscisic acid or methyl jasmonate, stimulate MPI mRNA accumulation, but not PRms mRNA accumulation. Local and systemic induction of the MPI gene expression in response to wounding occurs in maize plants. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first example of a gene from a monocotyledonous species that clearly shows a systemic wound response. The possible functional implications for the existence of different signal transduction pathways that simultaneously activate a battery of defense mechanisms against potential pathogens are discussed."
7925002,juvenile characters,Heterochronic effects of glossy15 mutations on epidermal cell identity in maize,"Vegetative development in maize is divided into a juvenile phase and an adult phase that differ in the expression of a large number of morphological, anatomical, and biochemical traits. Recessive mutations of Glossy15 cause a premature switch in the expression of some of these phase-specific traits. Mutant plants cease producing juvenile traits (e.g. epicuticular wax) and begin to produce adult traits (e.g. epidermal hairs) significantly earlier than their wild-type siblings. In glossy15-1 plants this switch generally occurs at leaf 2 or 3 rather than at the normal position of leaf 6 or 7. An analysis of the effect of glossy15 mutations on a variety of vegetative and reproductive traits revealed that these mutations only affect the character of the epidermis. They have no effect on the overall vegetative morphology of the plant, or on its reproductive development. This phenotype is the opposite of that of the gain-of-function mutations Teopod1, Teopod2 and Teopod3, all of which prolong the expression of a large number of juvenile traits. Double mutants between glossy15 and Teopod1 or Teopod2 indicate that Glossy15 is required for the effect of Teopod1 and Teopod2 on epidermal traits but not for other aspects of the Teopod phenotype. We conclude that Glossy15 initiates or maintains the expression of juvenile epidermal traits and suppresses the expression of adult epidermal traits, and that it acts downstream of the Teopod genes."
7950330,cell shape; cell size,Pattern formation in plant development:  Four vignettes,"In their development, plants precisely control the patterns of cell size, cell shape and cell division, the position of differentiation of cell types, and the position and number of organs. In the past year, progress has been made in understanding four of these five levels of control of plant pattern formation, including specification of cell fate by cell size in the alga Volvox carteri, genetic control of cell shape in the leaf hairs of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, precise control of cell division and cellular enlargement in Arabidopsis root meristems, and control of cell number in meristems of Arabidopsis, tobacco, and maize. These examples indicate that both the fate and shape of differentiated plant cells can be determined by the size of their undifferentiated precursors, and that the primary effect of mutations that alter cell fate and cellular shape can be on cell size. Furthermore, specific genes have been found that are necessary for normal patterns and numbers of cell divisions. Molecular cloning of these genes is revealing the molecular basis of plant cell division control."
7985019,inflorescence development,The sex determination process in maize,"Maize partitions the sexes into different flowers on the plant, a condition called monoecy, which facilitates outcrossing. Sex determination in maize is a complex process involving an interplay between genetic determinants, the environment, and hormones. Unisexuality of flowers is achieved by the process of selective arrest and abortion of the inappropriate organ primordia within a bisexual floral meristem. Floral organ abortion is associated with the degeneration of cells within an immature primordia. Masculinizing genes are required for gynoecial abortion, feminizing genes arrest stamen development, and both types also control secondary sexual traits involving morphological characteristics of floral tissues. Gibberellins, steroid-like plant hormones, appear to play a pivotal role in the stamen abortion process and the feminization of floral tissues."
8058838,flavonoid content; response to UV radiation; response to UV radiation,Flavonoids can protect maize DNA from the induction of ultraviolet radiation damage,"Diverse flavonoid compounds are widely distributed in angiosperm families. Flavonoids absorb radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, and it has been proposed that these compounds function as UV filters. We demonstrate that the DNA in Zea mays plants that contain flavonoids (primarily anthocyanins) is protected from the induction of damage caused by UV radiation relative to the DNA in plants that are genetically deficient in these compounds. DNA damage was measured with a sensitive and simple assay using individual monoclonal antibodies, one specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer damage and the other specific for pyrimidine(6,4)pyrimidone damage."
8102347,response to Bipolaris maydis,"Linkage of rhm, a recessive gene for resistance to southern corn leaf blight, to RFLP marker loci in maize (Zea mays) seedlings","The recessive gene rhm confers chlorotic-lesion resistance to Bipolaris maydis race O, the southern corn leaf blight pathogen, in otherwise susceptible maize plants. Because of inconsistencies encountered in scoring the disease on mature plants in the field, an assay was developed to monitor the expression of this gene in maize seedlings under controlled conditions. One hundred and two related F3 families from the cross RH95rhm x B73 were inoculated with conidia of B. maydis race O, and the genotype at the rhm locus of each F2 parent was deduced from the reactions observed in the progeny seedlings. The F2 genomes were reconstituted by extracting DNA from leaf tissue pooled from 30-36 F3 progeny plants per family. The seedling disease ratings were analyzed together with the segregation scores for 14 single-copy DNA probes. Our results indicate that rhm is tightly linked to two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker loci (UMC85 and p144) that map to the short arm of chromosome 6. In addition, a rapid assay based on the polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the linkage between rhm and the p144 RFLP marker locus in a second unrelated F2 population."
8106080,microspore development,Molecular characterization of one of the maize polygalacturonase gene family members which are expressed during late pollen development,"A gene exhibiting homology to the polygalacturonases of several species, including tomato and Oenothera, has been shown by RNA dot-blot analysis and in situ hybridization experiments to be expressed post-first microspore mitosis in maize. A 2.87 kbp section of the promoter fused to E. coli beta-glucuronidase (uidA) coding sequence conferred the correct spatial and temporal expression in transgenic tobacco plants. However, low levels of expression were detected in other tissues, and in particular in the tissues surrounding the vascular branch points of leaf nodes. The maize polygalacturonase gene is one member of a highly conserved gene family. The lack of detectable expression in sporophytic tissues and the isolation of a number of related cDNAs from maize suggests that all expressed members of this family show the same spatial and temporal regulation."
8146909,disease response; response to Bipolaris zeicola,Genetic patterns of plant host-parasite interactions,A parasite's ability to infect and a host's ability to resist infection can be heritable traits. Patterns of inheritance suggest how host genes interact with parasite genes to determine whether or not infection occurs. Recent progress in the isolation and characterization of these genes in plants sheds new light on parasitism.
8204823,response to flooding,A cereal haemoglobin gene is expressed in seed and root tissues under anaerobic conditions,"Legumes, and a very few non-legume plant species, are known to possess functioning haemoglobin genes. We describe here the characterization of a haemoglobin cDNA isolated from barley. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 71% amino acid identity with a non-legume haemoglobin gene, a further 16% of the residues being conservative replacements. The barley cDNA also hybridizes to genomic sequences in rye, maize and wheat. The demonstration of a gene from a monocotyledon with close sequence homology to the known non-legume plant haemoglobins fills a major gap in the known distribution of haemoglobin genes in the plant kingdom. The expression of the gene is induced in isolated barley aleurone layers exposed to anaerobic conditions, and the roots of flooding-stressed barley plants. The expression of the RNA under anoxic conditions is similar to that of a known anaerobic response gene, alcohol dehydrogenase. Our results suggest that the increased expression of haemoglobin RNA is an integral part of the normal anaerobic response in barley. The findings are discussed in the light of current theories of haemoglobin function and evolution."
8278534,response to benoxacor; response to metolachlor,Purification and characterization of a glutathione S-transferase from benoxacor-treated maize (Zea mays),"A glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozyme from maize (Zea mays Pioneer hybrid 3906) treated with the dichloroacetamide herbicide safener benoxacor (CGA-154281) was purified to homogeneity and partially characterized. The enzyme, assayed with metolachlor as a substrate, was purified approximately 200-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q resins, and affinity chromatography on S-hexylglutathione agarose from total GST activity present in etiolated shoots. The purified protein migrated during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as a single band with a molecular mass of 27 kD. Using nondenaturing PAGE, we determined that the native protein has a molecular mass of about 57 kD and that the protein exists as a dimer. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed only a single protein with an isoelectric point of 5.75 and molecular mass of 27 kD. These results further suggest that the protein exists as a homodimer of two identical 27-kD subunits. The enzyme was most active with substrates possessing a chloroacetamide structure. trans-Cinnamic acid and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were not effective substrates. Apparent Km values for the enzyme were 10.8 microM for the chloroacetamide metolachlor and 292 microM for glutathione. The enzyme was active from pH 6 to 9, with a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8. An apparently blocked amino terminus of the intact protein prevented direct amino acid sequencing. The enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the amino acid sequences of several peptide fragments were obtained."
8325489,"no. branches in primary lat. inflor.; internode length, primary lat. branch; percent cupules lacking pedic. spikelet; glume score; cupules per rank; disarticulation score; ear rank number; staminate score; ears per plant",Inheritance of the morphological differences between maize and teosinte - comparison of results for 2 F2 populations,"Molecular marker loci (MMLs) were employed to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in an F2 population derived from a cross of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and its probable progenitor, teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis). A total of 50 significant associations (putative QTLs) between the MMLs and nine key traits that distinguish maize and teosinte were identified. Results from this analysis are compared with our previous analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross of a different variety of maize and another subspecies of teosinte (Z. mays ssp. mexicana). For traits that measure the architectural differences between maize and teosinte, the two F2 populations possessed similar suites of QTLs. For traits that measure components of yield, substantially different suites of QTLs were identified in the two populations. QTLs that control about 20% or more of the phenotypic variance for a trait in one population were detected in the other population 81% of the time, while QTLs that control less than 10% of the variance in one population were detected in the other population only 28% of the time. In our previously published analysis of the maize x ssp. mexicana population, we identified five regions of the genome that control most of the key morphological differences between maize and teosinte. These same five regions also control most of the differences in the maize x ssp. parviglumis population. Results from both populations support the hypothesis that a relatively small number of loci with large effects were involved in the early evolution of the key traits that distinguish maize and teosinte. It is suggested that loci with large effects on morphology may not be a specific feature of crop evolution, but rather a common phenomenon in plant evolution whenever a species invades a new niche with reduced competition."
8390620,male fertility,Transposon tagging of a male sterility gene in Arabidopsis,"Transformation of the well-studied maize transposable elements into other plant species should enable transposon tagging methodology to be used for the isolation of interesting genes in the heterologous host. Here we describe the isolation of a transposon-tagged male sterile mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana using the maize Enhancer-Inhibitor transposable element system introduced into Arabidopsis. The mutant lacks pollen, preventing normal self-fertilization, a characteristic important for production of hybrid seed in many crop plants. We have identified an Enhancer-transposase-mediated Inhibitor element insertion responsible for the male sterile phenotype, and isolated the corresponding gene named MALE STERILITY 2. Critical evidence that the Inhibitor-element-containing gene is involved in the male sterile phenotype is provided by the DNA sequences of new excision-derived alleles from independent stable fertile and male sterile progeny of the original mutant."
8415698,response to oxygen stress,Maize mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutases are encoded by a differentially expressed multigene family,"We have isolated maize cDNAs encoding three manganese-containing superoxide dismutases (MnSODs) distinct from the one previously reported. Molecular analyses indicate that multiple MnSOD transcripts are encoded by different, though similar, genes in the maize genome. A single MnSOD gene has been reported in all other organisms examined to date. The deduced amino acid sequences show that these maize MnSOD proteins have a mitochondrial transit peptide and that the first 9 amino acids (matrix-targeting sequence) in the transit peptide are conserved. This suggests that all the maize MnSOD proteins are mitochondria-associated isozymes. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that each member of the maize MnSOD multigene family is both spatially and developmentally regulated. One gene, Sod3.3, was predominantly expressed in the embryo late in embryogenesis. Patterns of increased Mn-SOD transcript accumulation are shown to be associated with increased mitochondrial activity during plant growth and development. The influence of mitochondrial metabolism on the expression of the nuclear MnSOD genes is discussed."
8425057,drought response,The Cis-regulatory element CCACGTGG is involved in ABA and water-stress responses of the maize gene rab28,"The maize gene rab28 has been identified as ABA-inducible in embryos and vegetative tissues. It is also induced by water stress in young leaves. The proximal promoter region contains the conserved cis-acting element CCACGTGG (ABRE) reported for ABA induction in other plant genes. Transient expression assays in rice protoplasts indicate that a 134 bp fragment (-194 to -60 containing the ABRE) fused to a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (35S) is sufficient to confer ABA-responsiveness upon the GUS reporter gene. Gel retardation experiments indicate that nuclear proteins from tissues in which the rab28 gene is expressed can interact specifically with this 134 bp DNA fragment. Nuclear protein extracts from embryo and water-stressed leaves generate specific complexes of different electrophoretic mobility which are stable in the presence of detergent and high salt. However, by DMS footprinting the same guanine-specific contacts with the ABRE in both the embryo and leaf binding activities were detected. These results indicate that the rab28 promoter sequence CCACGTGG is a functional ABA-responsive element, and suggest that distinct regulatory factors with apparent similar affinity for the ABRE sequence may be involved in the hormone action during embryo development and in vegetative tissues subjected to osmotic stress."
8431957,male fertility,RNA editing of a chimeric maize mitochondrial gene transcript is sequence specific,"RNA editing was analysed in the mitochondrial ATPase complex subunit 6 gene (atp6) transcripts of the C male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-C) of maize. The only copy of atp6 in cms-C, designated C-atp6, is a triple gene fusion product comprised of DNA sequences derived from atp9, atp6, and an unknown origin. Sequences of cDNAs revealed 19 C to U alterations resulting in 16 amino acid residue changes compared to the genomic sequence. The only C to U edit in the 39-nucleotide sequence similar to atp9 was comparable to a change in the complete atp9 mRNAs of Petunia, Oenothera, wheat, and sorghum. The 442 nucleotides of unknown origin were not edited. The 18 editing events within the atp6 homologous region were similar to those in the atp6 transcripts of sorghum. RNA editing in maize C-atp6 transcripts introduces a translational stop codon at the same position where it is created by editing in sorghum and Oenothera atp6 mRNAs and is already present in atp6 open reading frames of most other plant and non-plant organisms. Our results, along with other reports on editing in chimeric transcripts, indicate that RNA editing is not influenced by rearrangements but instead is sequence specific."
8449949,response to methomyl; response to Bipolaris maydis; response to Phyllosticta maydis,"Cross-linking of the cms-T maize mitochondrial pore-forming protein URF13 by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and its effect on URF13 sensitivity to fungal toxins","URF13 is a membrane protein unique to mitochondria from maize having the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T), which is capable of permeabilizing biological membranes in the presence of a family of pathotoxins (T-toxins) produced by certain fungi or the insecticide methomyl. The carboxylate-specific reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide has been shown previously to protect URF13-containing membranes against the permeabilizing effects of added T-toxin or methomyl. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was found to covalently cross-link URF13 into higher order oligomers, including dimers, trimers, and tetramers, in isolated cms-T mitochondria and Escherichia coli cells expressing URF13. In intact E. coli cells and isolated spheroplasts, the observed protection against the effects of methomyl was not associated with the appearance of dimers but was correlated with the appearance of cross-linked trimers and tetramers. Following treatment of E. coli cells expressing URF13 with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the specific binding of tritiated T-toxin was reduced by 50% and all binding cooperativity was lost. A similar decrease in the level of T-toxin binding and loss of binding cooperativity were observed with site-directed, T-toxin-insensitive URF13 mutants at aspartate 39, the residue known to undergo reaction with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. When coupled with a postulated three membrane-spanning helical model of URF13, these results provide initial insights into the intermolecular interactions involved in URF13 oligomer formation."
8460472,response to maize chlorotic mottle virus,Transcripts of a maize chlorotic mottle virus cDNA clone replicate in maize protoplasts and infect maize plants,"A full-length cDNA clone (pMCM41) was constructed to contain the exact 5' end of MCMV behind a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a Smal site at the 3' end. Uncapped RNA synthesized from pMCM41 has the exact 3' end of viral RNA (vRNA) but is missing the cap found on vRNA. This RNA was infectious in protoplasts from black Mexican sweet (BMS) maize (Zea mays) suspension cultures. Uncapped transcripts were also infectious when inoculated onto maize plants and produced an infection indistinguishable from vRNA-inoculated plants. Capped pMCM41 transcripts which initiated at position +2 of the cDNA clone, as well as capped or uncapped RNA synthesized from a clone containing an extra G between the T7 promoter and the 5' end of MCMV sequence (pMCM721), were less infectious than uncapped pMCM41 transcripts in BMS protoplasts. The transcripts one nucleotide longer or shorter than uncapped pMCM41 transcripts were not able to infect maize plants."
8475086,response to fall armyworm; response to methomyl; male fertility; response to cabbage looper,Baculovirus expression of the maize mitochondrial protein urf13 confers insecticidal activity in cell cultures and larvae,"The URF13 protein, which is encoded by the mitochondrial gene T-urf13, is responsible for cytoplasmic male sterility and pathotoxin sensitivity in the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of maize. Mitochondrial sensitivity to two host-specific fungal toxins (T toxins) is mediated by the interaction of URF13 and T toxins to form pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane. A carbamate insecticide, methomyl, mimics the effects of T toxins on isolated cms-T mitochondria. URF13 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (fall army-worm) cells (Sf9) in culture and in Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) larvae with a baculovirus vector. In insect cells, URF13 forms oligomeric structures in the membrane and confers T toxin or methomyl sensitivity. Adding T toxin or methomyl to Sf9 cells producing URF13 causes permeabilization of plasma membranes. In addition, URF13 is toxic to insect cells grown in culture without T toxins or methomyl; even a T-toxin-insensitive mutant form of URF13 is lethal to cell cultures. Baculoviruses expressing URF13 are lethal to T. ni larvae, at times postinjection comparable to those obtained by injecting a baculovirus expressing an insect neurotoxin. This result suggests that URF13 could be useful as a biological control agent for insect pests. Our data indicate that URF13 has two independent mechanisms for toxicity, one that is mediated by T toxin and methomyl and one that is independent of these toxins. Similarly, male sterility and toxin sensitivity in cms-T maize may be due to independent mechanisms."
8517034,response to maize streak virus,Replication of maize streak virus mutants in maize protoplasts - evidence for a movement protein,"We have used protoplasts derived from a maize (Black Mexican Sweet) suspension culture to study the replication of maize streak virus (MSV) wild-type (wt) and mutant DNA genomes. Following inoculation with plasmids containing multimeric copies of MSV, both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded MSV DNA forms were produced, in proportions relative to those seen in infected plants. The immunodetection of coat protein (PV2) and geminate particles confirmed that the protoplasts were able to support the entire multiplication cycle of MSV and therefore were suitable for the study of MSV gene function. Inoculation of protoplasts with V1 gene mutants which are unable to produce systemic infections in plants resulted in DNA replication and encapsidation indistinguishable from that obtained with wt constructs implicating the protein in virus movement. Computer analysis of the V1 protein (PV1) indicated a potential trans-membrane or membrane-embedded domain. Following inoculation of protoplasts with V2 mutants, ssDNA was not detected; the inability of these mutants to spread in plants may be due to a lack of ssDNA, PV2, or a combination of the two. The requirements for systemic infection of MSV are discussed."
8536984,response to western corn rootworm; vertical root pulling strength,New rust resistance specificities associated with recombination in the rp1 complex in maize,"We address the question of whether genetic reassortment events, including unequal crossing over and gene conversion, at the Rp1 complex are capable of generating novel resistance specificities that were not present in the parents. Some 176 events involving genetic reassortment within the Rp1 complex were screened for novel resistance specificities with a set of 11 different rust biotypes. Most (150/176) of the events were susceptible to all tested rust biotypes, providing no evidence for new specificities. Eleven events selected as double-resistant recombinants, when screened with the 11 test biotypes, showed the combined resistance of the two parental types consistent with a simple recombination and pyramiding of the parental resistances. Nine events selected either as having partial resistance or complete susceptibility to a single biotype possessed resistance to a subset of the biotypes that the parents were resistant to, suggesting segregation of resistance genes present in the parental Rp1 complex. Four events gave rise to novel specificities being resistant to at least one rust biotype to which both parents were susceptible. All four had flanking marker exchange, demonstrating that crossing over within the Rp1 complex is associated with the appearance of new rust resistance specificities."
8536986,plant height; Flowering,"Comparative analysis of QTLs affecting plant height and maturity across the Poaceae, in reference to an interspecific sorghum population","Correspondence among QTLs affecting height and/or flowering was investigated across the five races of sorghum, an interspecific sorghum F2 population, and 32 previously published sorghum, maize, rice, wheat, and barley populations revealing 185 QTLs or discrete mutants. Among nine QTLs mapped in the interspecific sorghum population (six affecting height and three affecting flowering), at least seven (78%) are associated with ""conversion,"" backcross-introgression of alleles imparting reduced height or earlier flowering from cultivated sorghums into one or more exotic Sorghum bicolor races. One chromosomal region was ""converted"" in all S. bicolar races--in the interspecific F2, this region explained 54.8% of height variation (putatively the Dw2 gene) and 85.7% of flowering time variation (putatively Ma1). Comparative data suggest that Ma1 and Dw2 orthologs influence height and flowering of other Poaceae taxa and support classical dogma that the sorghum phenotypes attributed to Ma1 and Dw2 (respectively) are due to different genetic loci. Other sorghum QTLs also showed correspondence with those in other Poaceae, more frequently than would be expected by chance. Possible homoeologous QTLs were found within both the maize and sorghum genomes. Comparative QTL mapping provides a means to unify, and thereby simplify, molecular analysis of complex phenotypes."
8582870,forage quality,Characteristics of plant cell walls affecting intake and digestibility of forages by ruminants,"Even under the intensive concentrate feeding systems of ruminant animal production in the United States, forages continue to represent the single most important feed resource. Cell-wall concentration and digestibility limit the intake potential and energy availability of forage crops in beef and dairy production. Identification of cell-wall characteristics that should be targets of genetic modification is required if plant breeders and molecular biologists are to successfully improve forages for livestock feeding. As the forage plant cell develops, phenolic acids and lignin are deposited in the maturing cell wall in specific structural conformations, and in a strict developmental sequence. Lignin is the key element that limits cell-wall digestibility, but cross-linkage of lignin and wall polysaccharides by ferulic acid bridges may be a prerequisite for lignin to exert its affect. Lignin composition and p-coumaric acid in the wall are less likely to affect digestibility. Voluntary intake of forages is a critical determinant of animal performance and cell-wall concentration is negatively related to intake of ruminants consuming high-forage diets. Cell walls affect intake by contributing to ruminal fill. A simple model of cell-wall digestion and passage in which ruminal fill is a function of rates of digestion and passage, as well as the indigestible fraction of the cell-wall indicates that cell-wall concentration and rate of passage are the most critical parameters determining ruminal fill. Plant factors that affect rate of passage include those that affect particle size reduction by chewing and those that affect particle buoyancy in the rumen. The latter is primarily affected by 1) the ability of the particulate matter to retain gases, which is probably related to plant anatomy and rate of digestion of the plant tissue, and 2) the rate at which the gas is produced, which is affected by the potentially digestible fraction of the particulate matter and the rate of digestion of this fraction. Increasing rate of digestion should increase rate of passage by diminishing the gas produced and increasing density over time. A reduction in the indigestible cell-wall fraction is beneficial because this will decrease fill and increase digestibility. Animal production and economic benefits from reduced cell-wall concentration and increased digestibility are significant. Because of the high cell-wall concentration and large digestible cell-wall fraction of grasses, reduction in cell-wall concentration would probably be of greater value than improving digestibility in these species. Legumes represent the opposite situation and may benefit more from improvements in the digestibility of their cell walls."
8709961,response to alachlor; response to alachlor,Identification of genetic factors for alachlor tolerance in maize by molecular markers analysis,"Genetic factors controlling tolerance to the herbicide Alachlor in maize were localised by means of two different strategies. In the first approach, backcross (BC) plants, derived from pollen which had been subjected to selective pressure for resistance to the herbicide, were analysed for segregation distortion at 47 RFLP loci and compared to BC plants obtained from non-selected pollen. Preferential transmission of five chromosomal regions where putative QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci) are localised was revealed in the BC plants from selected pollen. A second approach was based on a classical linkage analysis for segregation of the same set of RFLPs and factors controlling the trait, in a BC population of 210 individuals, by means of regression analysis. This study detected seven significant loci in four genomic regions. Overall, two loci revealed both segregation distortion and association with the expression of the trait, indicating linkage to genes expressed in both gametophytic and sporophytic phase. Three chromosomal regions appeared to carry factors involved in plant tolerance to Alachlor which are not expressed in pollen. Conversely, three loci were linked to factors selectable in pollen, but did not reveal significant association with tolerance in the plant in the segregating populations."
8825473,response to Ustilago maydis,"Genetics of Ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen that induces tumors in maize","Ustilago maydis induces tumors in maize. It is dimorphic, with a unicellular, nonpathogenic form, and a dikaryotic, filamentous, pathogenic form that requires the plant for its growth. The life cycle is regulated by two mating type loci, a and b: a has two alleles, which encode a pheromone and a receptor; b is multiallelic and encodes a combinatorial homeodomain protein. Cell fusion occurs between haploid cells with different a alleles. The dikaryon formed exhibits filamentous growth if the cells also carry any two different b alleles. The b locus is the major pathogenicity determinant, fuz7, which encodes a MAP kinase activator, is also necessary for tumor induction and may respond to plant signals. Several other genes have been identified (fuz1, fuz2, rtf1, uac, ubc) that affect different aspects of the life cycle transitions. Some of them may identify targets of the b locus. Signaling between pathogen and plant is of key importance in tumor induction and fungal growth and differentiation within the plant. The role of siderophores is also discussed."
8849905,semi-sterility,Gametophyte genetics in Zea mays L: Dominance of a restoration-of-fertility allele (Rf3) in diploid pollen,"In Zea mays L. plants carrying the S-type of sterility-inducing cytoplasm, male fertility is determined by a gametophytic, nuclear restoration-of-fertility gene. Haploid pollen carrying the fertility-restoring allele (historically designated Rf3) is starch-filled and functional, whereas pollen carrying the nonrestoring allele (historically designated rf3) is shrunken and nonfunctional. Because restoration of fertility occurs in haploid tissue, the dominance relationship of restoring and nonrestoring alleles is unknown. We have tested the dominance relationship of the restoring and nonrestoring alleles at the rf3 locus in diploid pollen. The meiotic mutant elongate was used to generate tetraploid plants carrying both Rf3 and rf3 alleles in the S cytoplasm. These plants shed predominantly starch-filled pollen, consistent with dominance of the restoring allele. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms linked to the rf3 locus demonstrated cotransmission of rf3 and Rf3 alleles through heterozygous diploid pollen, providing conclusive genetic evidence that the restoring allele is the dominant or functional form of this restoration-of-fertility gene. We suggest that other S-cytoplasm restorers result from loss-of-function mutations and propose analysis of unreduced gametes as a test of this model."
8874068,Nucleic acid traits,Amino acid analysis of proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis in maize: Isoform detection and function identification,"The possibility of using experimentally determined amino acid composition to assess relatedness between 75 proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and to identify them was tested on maize. Two independent parameters, the relative Euclidean distance and the correlation coefficient between the amino acid compositions, were evaluated and used. Previous sequence information for 31 out of the 75 proteins made it possible to evaluate the method for the detection of isoforms and for identification. However, the extension of the interrogation beyond maize to all plant sequences raised the problem of false positives that could nevertheless be limited by replications and by using additional information. The efficiency of the method to assess relatedness between proteins should make amino acid composition analysis a valuable tool in large protein characterization programs based on 2-DE, by facilitating the transfer of information from one well-documented organ/tissue or genotype to another."
9165071,herbicide response,Plant glutathione S-transferases and herbicide detoxification,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and reactive endogenous compounds. The interest in plant GSTs may be attributed to their agronomic value, since it has been demonstrated that glutathione conjugation for a variety of herbicides is the major resistance and selectivity factor in plants. The structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana isoenzyme, the first plant GST whose structure has been solved, may serve as a model system for the understanding of herbicide selectivity in crops."

98291496,response to nitrogen,A response-regulator homologue possibly involved in nitrogen signal transduction mediated by cytokinin in maize,"A cDNA clone, pZmCip1, encoding a maize (Zea mays) cytokinin-inducible protein 1 was isolated utilizing the differential display technique, and studied using the expression of ZmCip1 in nitrogen-starved maize plants. The cloned cDNA contained an open reading frame consisting of 157 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 16.7 kDa, which possesses similarity with the response-regulators of bacterial two-component signalling systems. In detached leaves, accumulation of ZmCip1 transcript by t-zeatin was dose-dependent in a range of 10(-9) M to 10(-7) M, and occurred within 30 min after treatment. The effect of t-zeatin was replaceable by isopentenyl-adenosine or isopentenyl-adenosine-5'-monophosphate. Pretreatment of detached leaves with cycloheximide did not inhibit the accumulation of the transcript. In whole plants, ZmCip1 transcript was transiently accumulated exclusively in leaves by supply of nitrate or ammonium ions to the roots, whereas the transcript was not accumulated in detached leaves by supply of the nitrogen nutrients. Both the cytokinin- and nitrate-responsive accumulations of ZmCip1 transcript were accompanied by an increase in the immunotitratable protein. Isopentenyladenosine and/or its phosphorylated form(s) accumulated in roots 2 h after supply of nitrate to plants. These results, taken together, suggest that ZmCip1 is a primary response gene to cytokinins, and that it involves, at least in part, the nitrogen-signal transduction mediated by cytokinin in maize."
98356031,response to corn earworm; maysin content; apimaysin content,Genetic mechanisms underlying apimaysin and maysin synthesis and corn earworm antibiosis in maize (Zea mays L.),"C-glycosyl flavones in maize silks confer resistance (i.e., antibiosis) to corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea [Boddie]) larvae and are distinguished by their B-ring substitutions, with maysin and apimaysin being the di- and monohydroxy B-ring forms, respectively. Herein, we examine the genetic mechanisms underlying the synthesis of maysin and apimaysin and the corresponding effects on corn earworm larval growth. Using an F2 population, we found a quantitative trait locus (QTL), rem1, which accounted for 55.3% of the phenotypic variance for maysin, and a QTL, pr1, which explained 64.7% of the phenotypic variance for apimaysin. The maysin QTL did not affect apimaysin synthesis, and the apimaysin QTL did not affect maysin synthesis, suggesting that the synthesis of these closely related compounds occurs independently. The two QTLs, rem1 and pr1, were involved in a significant epistatic interaction for total flavones, suggesting that a ceiling exists governing the total possible amount of C-glycosyl flavone. The maysin and apimaysin QTLs were significant QTLs for corn earworm antibiosis, accounting for 14. 1% (rem1) and 14.7% (pr1) of the phenotypic variation. An additional QTL, represented by umc85 on the short arm of chromosome 6, affected antibiosis (R2 = 15.2%), but did not affect the synthesis of the C-glycosyl flavones."
