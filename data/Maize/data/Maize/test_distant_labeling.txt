When O 0
a O 0
plant O 0
root O 0
is O 0
reoriented O 0
within O 0
the O 0
gravity O 0
field, O 0
it O 0
responds O 0
by O 0
initiating O 0
a O 0
curvature O 0
which O 0
eventually O 0
results O 0
in O 0
vertical O 0

Gravity O 0

occurs O 0
primarily O 0
in O 0
the O 0

Gravisensing O 0

a O 0

The O 0

in O 0

probably O 0

The O 0

that O 0
gravity-induced O 0
auxin O 0

a O 0

However, O 0

that O 0
the O 0

The O 0

1) O 0
the O 0
ability O 0

the O 0

which O 0

A O 0
reduction O 0
in O 0
the O 0

because O 0
this O 0

from O 0
reduced O 0
cell-wall O 0

Because O 0

We O 0
show O 0
here O 0
that O 0
a O 0
cell-wall O 0
invertase O 0
encoded O 0
by O 0
the O 0
Incw1 O 0
gene O 0
is O 0
regulated O 0
at O 0
both O 0
the O 0

by O 0
sugars O 0
in O 0
a O 0

The O 0
Incw1 O 0
gene O 0
encoded O 0
two O 0
transcripts: O 0
Incw1-S O 0
(small) O 0
and O 0
Incw1-L O 0
(large); O 0
the O 0
size O 0
variation O 0
was O 0
attributable O 0
to O 0
different O 0
lengths O 0
in O 0
the O 0
3' O 0

region. O 0

Both O 0
metabolizable O 0
and O 0
nonmetabolizable O 0
sugars O 0
induced O 0
Incw1-L O 0
RNA O 0
apparently O 0
by O 0
default. O 0

However, O 0
only O 0
the O 0
metabolizable O 0
sugars, O 0
sucrose O 0
and O 0
D-glucose, O 0
were O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
the O 0
increased O 0
steady-state O 0

of O 0
Incw1-S O 0

the O 0

and O 0
the O 0
downstream O 0
metabolic O 0

of O 0
the O 0

Sh1. O 0

Conversely, O 0
nonmetabolizable O 0
sugars, O 0
including O 0
the O 0
two O 0
glucose O 0
analogs O 0
3-O-methylglucose O 0
and O 0
2-deoxyglucose, O 0
induced O 0
greater O 0
steady-state O 0

of O 0
the O 0
Incw1-L O 0

but O 0
this O 0
increase O 0
did O 0
not O 0
lead O 0
to O 0
either O 0
an O 0
increase O 0
in O 0
the O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
the O 0
INCW1 O 0
protein/enzyme O 0
activity O 0
or O 0
the O 0
repression O 0
of O 0
the O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
that O 0
sugar O 0
sensing O 0

the O 0

of O 0
the O 0
Incw1 O 0

is O 0

More O 0

our O 0

also O 0

that O 0

The O 0

This O 0

Because O 0

Upon O 0
herbivore O 0

maize O 0
(Zea O 0

emits O 0
a O 0
mixture O 0

volatile O 0
compounds O 0
that O 0
attracts O 0

One O 0
of O 0
the O 0

this O 0

is O 0
an O 0
unusual O 0

C11 O 0
homoterpene, O 0
(3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene O 0

which O 0
is O 0
also O 0
emitted O 0
by O 0
many O 0
other O 0
species O 0
following O 0
herbivore O 0

Biosynthesis O 0

DMNT O 0
has O 0
been O 0
previously O 0
shown O 0
to O 0
proceed O 0
via O 0
the O 0
sesquiterpene O 0
alcohol, O 0
(E)-nerolidol. O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
an O 0
enzyme O 0
activity O 0
that O 0
converts O 0
farnesyl O 0
diphosphate, O 0
the O 0
universal O 0

The O 0
properties O 0
of O 0
this O 0
(E)-nerolidol O 0

resemble O 0
those O 0
of O 0
other O 0
terpene O 0

Evidence O 0
for O 0
its O 0
participation O 0
in O 0
DMNT O 0
biosynthesis O 0
includes O 0
the O 0
direct O 0
incorporation O 0
of O 0
deuterium-labeled O 0
(E)-nerolidol O 0
into O 0

and O 0

Since O 0
farnesyl O 0
diphosphate O 0
has O 0
many O 0
other O 0
metabolic O 0
fates, O 0
(E)-nerolidol O 0

may O 0
represent O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

to O 0
be O 0

The O 0

that O 0

BACKGROUND: O 0
The O 0
maize O 0
INDETERMINATE1 O 0
gene, O 0
ID1, O 0
is O 0
a O 0
key O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
the O 0
transition O 0
to O 0
flowering O 1
and O 0
the O 0
founding O 0
member O 0
of O 0
a O 0
transcription O 0
factor O 0
gene O 0
family O 0
that O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0
protein O 0
with O 0
a O 0
distinct O 0
arrangement O 0
of O 0
zinc O 0
finger O 0
motifs. O 0

The O 0
zinc O 0
fingers O 0
and O 0
surrounding O 0
sequence O 0
make O 0
up O 0
the O 0
signature O 0
ID O 0
domain O 0
(IDD), O 0
which O 0
appears O 0
to O 0
be O 0
found O 0
in O 0
all O 0
higher O 0
plant O 0
genomes. O 0

The O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
zinc O 0
finger O 0
domains O 0
and O 0
previous O 0
biochemical O 0
studies O 0
showing O 0
that O 0
ID1 O 0
binds O 0
to O 0
DNA O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
members O 0
of O 0
this O 0
gene O 0
family O 0
are O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
transcriptional O 0
regulation. O 0

RESULTS: O 0
Comparison O 0
of O 0
IDD O 0
genes O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
and O 0
rice O 0
genomes, O 0
and O 0
all O 0
IDD O 0
genes O 0
discovered O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
EST O 0
and O 0
genomic O 0
databases, O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
ID1 O 0
is O 0
a O 0
unique O 0
member O 0
of O 0
this O 0
gene O 0
family. O 0

High O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
sequence O 0
similarity O 0
amongst O 0
all O 0
IDD O 0
genes O 0
from O 0
maize, O 0
rice O 0
and O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
they O 0
are O 0
derived O 0
from O 0
a O 0
common O 0
ancestor. O 0

Several O 0
unique O 0
features O 0
of O 0
ID1 O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
it O 0
is O 0
a O 0
divergent O 0
member O 0
of O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
IDD O 0
family. O 0

Although O 0
no O 0
clear O 0
ID1 O 0
ortholog O 0
was O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
the O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
genome, O 0
highly O 0
similar O 0
genes O 0
that O 0
encode O 0
proteins O 0
with O 0
identity O 0
extending O 0
beyond O 0
the O 0
ID O 0
domain O 0
were O 0
isolated O 0
from O 0
rice O 0
and O 0
sorghum. O 0

Phylogenetic O 0
comparisons O 0
show O 0
that O 0
these O 0
putative O 0
orthologs, O 0
along O 0
with O 0
maize O 0
ID1, O 0
form O 0
a O 0
group O 0
separate O 0
from O 0
other O 0
IDD O 0
genes. O 0

In O 0
contrast O 0
to O 0
ID1 O 0
mRNA, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
detected O 0
exclusively O 0
in O 0
immature O 0
leaves, O 0
several O 0
maize O 0
IDD O 0
genes O 0
showed O 0
a O 0
broad O 0
range O 0
of O 0
expression O 0
in O 0
various O 0
tissues. O 0

Further, O 0
Western O 0
analysis O 0
with O 0
an O 0
antibody O 0
that O 0
cross-reacts O 0
with O 0
ID1 O 0
protein O 0
and O 0
potential O 0
orthologs O 0
from O 0
rice O 0
and O 0
sorghum O 0
shows O 0
that O 0
all O 0
three O 0
proteins O 0
are O 0
detected O 0
in O 0
immature O 0
leaves O 1
only. O 0

CONCLUSION: O 0
Comparative O 0
genomic O 0
analysis O 0
shows O 0
that O 0
the O 0
IDD O 0
zinc O 0
finger O 0
family O 0
is O 0
highly O 0
conserved O 0
among O 0
both O 0
monocots O 0
and O 0
dicots. O 0

The O 0

distinguishes O 0
it O 0
from O 0

A O 0

The O 0

the O 0

However, O 0
biochemical O 0

revealed O 0
relatively O 0

that O 0

Consequently, O 0

We O 0

In O 0

we O 0

Here, O 0

GWAS O 0

that O 0
two O 0

Observed O 0

about O 0
7000 O 0

Through O 0
the O 0

we O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
used O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
we O 0
examined O 0
whether O 0

by O 0
glyphosate O 0
(influencing O 0

All O 0
of O 0
these O 0
perturbations O 0
increased O 0
the O 0

thus O 0
suggesting O 0
a O 0

Overall, O 0
these O 0

24 O 0

Overall, O 0
336 O 0

and O 0
genotyped O 0
with O 0

Phenology O 0
was O 0
the O 0

Then O 0

However, O 0
most O 0

and O 0
we O 0
observed O 0
similar O 0

suggesting O 0
a O 0
major O 0

As O 0
a O 0
consequence, O 0
the O 0
number O 0
of O 0

exceeded O 0
the O 0

the O 0

characterize O 0
the O 0

First, O 0
we O 0
mapped O 0
genomic O 0

and O 0
identified O 0

In O 0

the O 0

We O 0
argue, O 0

Insects O 0
consistently O 0
performed O 0
better O 0
on O 0

than O 0
on O 0

As O 0
hypothesized, O 0
this O 0

but O 0
none O 0
that O 0

Concentrations O 0

but O 0
the O 0
reverse O 0
was O 0
true O 0
for O 0
the O 0
roots. O 0

It O 0
appears O 0
that O 0
chemical O 0
defenses O 0
that O 0

specialized O 0
insects O 0
are O 0
still O 0

that O 0

These O 0

whether O 0
sodium O 0

also O 0
modulate O 0

To O 0
answer O 0
this O 0
question, O 0
a O 0
hydroponic O 0
study O 0
on O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

was O 0
established, O 0
by O 0
exposing O 0
plants O 0
to O 0
50mM O 0
of O 0
sodium O 0
glucosamide O 0
or O 0

The O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
both O 0

on O 0
ABA O 0
was O 0
investigated O 0
in O 0
an O 0

before O 0
(i) O 0

accumulated O 0
to O 0
toxic O 0

concentrations O 0
and O 0
before O 0
(ii) O 0

dehydrated. O 0

This O 0
allowed O 0
studying O 0
early O 0
responses O 0
to O 0
Na O 0
and O 0

separately, O 0
well O 0
before O 0

were O 0
stressed O 0
by O 0
these O 0

Gas O 0

was O 0
quantified O 0
via O 0

The O 0
results O 0
reveal O 0
that O 0
Cl O 0
and O 0
Na O 0
induce O 0
the O 0
increase O 0
of O 0

at O 0
two O 0
hours O 0
after O 0
plants O 0
were O 0
exposed O 0
to O 0
50mM O 0
of O 0
the O 0
ions. O 0

Surprisingly, O 0
this O 0
effect O 0
was O 0
more O 0
pronounced O 0
in O 0
response O 0
to O 0
the O 0
Cl O 0
component. O 0

The O 0
increase O 0
in O 0
the O 0
guard-cell O 0
regulating O 0
ABA O 1

correlated O 0
with O 0
a O 0

Mainly O 0
because O 0
of O 0
this O 0
result O 0
we O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
the O 0
early O 0

in O 0

it O 0

that O 0

directly O 0

However, O 0
it O 0

induces O 0

Using O 0

we O 0

that O 0

the O 0

Using O 0

we O 0
predict O 0
that O 0

are O 0
also O 0

Using O 0

The O 0

In O 0
Arabidopsis, O 0
ABA O 0
is O 0
sensed O 0
by O 0
the O 0
PYL O 0

which O 0
leads O 0

These O 0
components O 0
functioning O 0

and O 0

in O 0
ABA O 0

are O 0
little O 0

Using O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
several O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0

is O 0
contingent O 0
on O 0
the O 0

Among O 0

However, O 0
in O 0

In O 0

Root O 0

in O 0
the O 0

which O 0
forms O 0
shortened O 0
roots O 0
and O 0
is O 0
hyposensitive O 0
to O 0

was O 0
less O 0

by O 0
Al O 0

than O 0
that O 0
in O 0
the O 0

B73. O 0

In O 0
the O 0
zmpgp1 O 0
mutants, O 0
the O 0
root O 0

displayed O 0
higher O 0
auxin O 0

and O 0
enhanced O 0
auxin O 0
signaling O 0
under O 0
Al O 0

which O 0
was O 0
also O 0
consistent O 0
with O 0
the O 0
increased O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
the O 0
behavior O 0
of O 0
the O 0
auxin-responsive O 0

transgene, O 0
DR5rev:RFP, O 0
we O 0
concluded O 0
that O 0
Al O 0
stress O 0
reduced O 0
the O 0
level O 0
of O 0
auxin O 0
in O 0
the O 0
root O 0
tip; O 0
which O 0
contrasts O 0
with O 0
the O 0
tendency O 0
of O 0
Al O 0
stress-induced O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
plants O 0
to O 0
accumulate O 0
more O 0
auxin O 0
in O 0
their O 0
root O 0
tips. O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
Al O 0
stress O 0
induced O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
ZmPGP1. O 0

Therefore, O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
Al O 0
stress O 0
is O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
reduced O 0
auxin O 0
accumulation O 0
in O 0
root O 0
tips, O 0
a O 0
process O 0
which O 0
is O 0
regulated O 0
by O 0
ZmPGP1, O 0
and O 0
thus O 0
causes O 0

Deciphering O 0

can O 0
benefit O 0
our O 0

However, O 0
considering O 0

should O 0
be O 0
evaluated O 0
under O 0

In O 0
this O 0

a O 0
genome-wide O 0

using O 0
two O 0

In O 0
total, O 0
259 O 0
candidate O 0

were O 0
identified O 0
and O 0
these O 0
candidate O 0

are O 0
mainly O 0

in O 0
four O 0

Among O 0
these O 0
candidate O 0
genes, O 0
98 O 0
showed O 0

increased O 0

For O 0

All O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
functions O 0

maize O 0
under O 0

Low O 0
Pi O 0
increased O 0
AMF O 0

Further O 0

AMF O 0
significantly O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
the O 0
Pi-transporter O 0

ZmPt9, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
induced O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
ZmPt9-overexpressing O 0

were O 0
difficult O 0
to O 0
colonize O 0

Together, O 0
these O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
examined O 0
global O 0

in O 0

The O 0

Are O 0
indicative O 0
of O 0
metabolic O 0

during O 0

that O 0
enable O 0

This O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0

We O 0
used O 0
advanced O 0
proteomic O 0

to O 0
identify O 0

Using O 0
proteomic O 0
analysis, O 0
4878 O 0
proteins O 0
in O 0
roots O 0
and O 0

were O 0
detected O 0
and O 0
of O 0
these O 0

showed O 0
significant O 0
changes O 0
of O 0

Protein O 0

were O 0
analyzed O 0
using O 0
hierarchical O 0

protein O 0

and O 0
protein-protein O 0

All O 0
three O 0
data O 0
analysis O 0
pipelines O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
proteins O 0
such O 0
as O 0
jasmonic O 0
acid O 0
biosynthetic O 0
enzymes, O 0
serine O 0
proteases, O 0
protease O 0

proteins O 0
involved O 0
in O 0

of O 0

producing O 0

and O 0
isopentenyl O 0

a O 0
precursor O 0
for O 0
volatile O 0
production, O 0
were O 0
upregulated O 0
in O 0
roots O 0
during O 0
WCR O 0

In O 0
leaves, O 0
highly O 0
abundant O 0
proteins O 0
were O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
signal O 0

suggesting O 0
activation O 0
of O 0
systemic O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
that O 0
these O 0
protein O 0
networks O 0
contribute O 0
to O 0
the O 0
overall O 0
herbivore O 0

mechanisms O 0
in O 0
Mp708. O 0

Because O 0
the O 0
plants O 0
were O 0
grown O 0
in O 0
potting O 0
mix O 0
and O 0
not O 0

sand, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
both O 0
microbial O 0
and O 0
insect O 0
defense-related O 0
proteins O 0
were O 0
present O 0
in O 0
the O 0

The O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
the O 0
high O 0
constitutive O 0

of O 0
reduced O 0

in O 0
roots O 0
and O 0
benzothiazole O 0
in O 0
the O 0

suggest O 0
a O 0

interaction O 0
among O 0
the O 0
plant, O 0
soil O 0
microbiomes O 0
and O 0
WCR-infested O 0

suggesting O 0
that O 0
defenses O 0
against O 0
insects O 0
coexist O 0
with O 0
defenses O 0
against O 0
bacteria O 0
and O 0
fungi O 0
due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
interaction O 0
between O 0

In O 0
this O 0

Historically, O 0
at O 0
least O 0
with O 0
respect O 0
to O 0
maize O 0
plants, O 0
this O 0
phenomenon O 0
is O 0
attributed O 0
to O 0
three O 0
sequential O 0
processes, O 0
namely O 0
graviperception, O 0
the O 0
transduction O 0
of O 0
the O 0
perceived O 0

and O 0
the O 0
graviresponse, O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0
a O 0

the O 0
primary O 0
and O 0
initiating O 0

Based O 0

The O 0

that O 0
the O 0

The O 0
aim O 0
of O 0
this O 0

was O 0
to O 0
identify O 0
genomic O 0

These O 0
three O 0

Once O 0
these O 0

they O 0
will O 0
be O 0

We O 0
have O 0

to O 0
create O 0
a O 0

and, O 0
possibly, O 0
for O 0
other O 0
important O 0

as O 0
well. O 0

The O 0
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated O 0
editing O 0
of O 0
ZmMTL O 0
(ZmPLA1) O 0
enabled O 0
a O 0

to O 0
be O 0
created. O 0

The O 0

was O 0
effective O 0
for O 0
maternal O 0

for O 0
both O 0
mature O 0
seeds O 0
and O 0
young O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
the O 0
system O 0
should O 0
be O 0
robust O 0
in O 0
an O 0
open O 0

It O 0
also O 0
offers O 0
the O 0
potential O 0
for O 0
other O 0
important O 0

such O 0
as O 0

and O 0
barley, O 0
for O 0
which O 0
there O 0
is O 0
no O 0

With O 0
its O 0
broad O 0

this O 0

has O 0
great O 0

for O 0

Visualizing O 0

The O 0

has O 0
focused O 0
on O 0

about O 0
the O 0

that O 0

In O 0
maize, O 0
seven O 0

have O 0
been O 0

In O 0
this O 0

discuss O 0
whether O 0
the O 0

Three O 0
different O 0

were O 0
performed: O 0
1) O 0
single-variant O 0

2) O 0

(STR) O 0
and O 0
3) O 0

Using O 0

257, O 0
300, O 0

KRN-associated O 0

Of O 0
these, O 0
231 O 0

were O 0
subjected O 0

that O 0
were O 0

Genetic O 0

results O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
the O 0
three O 0
GWAS O 0
approaches O 0
are O 0
complementary. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
KAVs O 0
in O 0

were O 0
more O 0

to O 0
exhibit O 0

than O 0
KAVs O 0
in O 0
recombinationally O 0
active O 0

probably O 0
as O 0
a O 0
consequence O 0
of O 0

The O 0
KAVs O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
this O 0

have O 0
the O 0

BACKGROUND: O 0
In O 0
vivo O 0
haploid O 0
induction O 0
(HI) O 0
based O 0
on O 0
Stock6-derived O 0
inducer O 0

has O 0
been O 0
the O 0
most O 0
prevalent O 0
means O 0
of O 0
producing O 0
haploids. O 0

Nevertheless, O 0
the O 0
biological O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
HI O 1
is O 0
not O 0
fully O 0
understood, O 0
the O 0
twin-embryo O 0
kernels O 0
had O 0
been O 0
found O 0
during O 0
haploid O 0
induction, O 0
which O 0
may O 0
provide O 0
potential O 0
evidence O 0
for O 0
the O 0
abnormal O 0
double O 0
fertilization O 1
during O 0
HI.<p> O 0
RESULTS: O 0
We O 0
investigated O 0
twin-embryo O 0
frequency O 0
in O 0
progenies O 0
of O 0
different O 0
haploid O 0
inducers. O 0

Results O 0
reveal O 0
that O 0
increasing O 0
the O 0
HI O 1
potential O 0
significantly O 0
improved O 0
the O 0
frequency O 0
of O 0
twin-embryo O 0

Compared O 0
with O 0

CAUHOI, O 0
the O 0

in O 0

This O 0

was O 0
further O 0
confirmed O 0
by O 0
pollinating O 0

HIRs, O 0
where O 0

was O 0
highly O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
HIR. O 0

Among O 0
237 O 0
twin-embryo O 0
kernels, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
30 O 0
haploid O 0
twin-embryo O 0
kernels O 0
(12.66%), O 0
a O 0
frequency O 0
which O 0
was O 0
much O 0
greater O 0
than O 0
the O 0
average O 0
HI O 1
rate O 0
for O 0
three O 0
other O 0
inducer O 0
lines O 0
(frequency O 0
range O 0
2-10%). O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
aneuploids, O 0
occurred O 0
at O 0
high O 0
frequency O 0
(8 O 0
in O 0
41 O 0
twin O 0

This O 0
level O 0
of O 0
aneuploidy O 0
provides O 0
new O 0
insight O 0
into O 0
the O 0
abnormal O 0
double O 0

during O 0
HI. O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
observed O 0
differences O 0
in O 0
growth O 0
rate O 0
between O 0
twin O 0
plants O 0
in O 0
the O 0
field, O 0
as O 0
4.22% O 0
of O 0
the O 0
twin O 0

grew O 0
at O 0
a O 0
significantly O 0
different O 0
rate. O 0

Both O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
>&#8201;90% O 0
of O 0
the O 0
twin O 0

shared O 0
the O 0
same O 0
origin, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
growth O 0
difference O 0
could O 0
be O 0
attributed O 0
to O 0
aneuploidy, O 0

CONCLUSION: O 0
These O 0

The O 0

two O 0
evolutionarily O 0

The O 0

occur O 0
in O 0
different O 0

both O 0

While O 0
the O 0

we O 0
have O 0

a O 0

In O 0

Maize O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
important O 0
cereal O 0
crop O 0
species O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
uses O 0
for O 0
human O 0
and O 0
cattle O 0
nourishment, O 0
as O 0
well O 0
as O 0
its O 0
industrial O 0
use O 0
as O 0
a O 0
raw O 0
material. O 0

The O 0
yield O 1
and O 0
grain O 1
quality O 1
of O 0
maize O 0
depend O 0
on O 0
plant O 0
establishment, O 0
which O 0
starts O 0
with O 0
germination. O 0

Germination O 0
is O 0
dependent O 0
on O 0
embryo O 0
vigor O 0
and O 0
the O 0
stored O 0
reserves O 0
in O 0
the O 0
scutellum O 0
and O 0
endosperm. O 0

During O 0
germination, O 0
the O 0
scutellum O 0
epidermis O 0
changes O 0
and O 0
secretes O 0
enzymes O 0
and O 0
hormones O 0
into O 0
the O 0
endosperm. O 0

As O 0
a O 0
result, O 0
the O 0
hydrolysis O 0
products O 0
of O 0
the O 0
reserves O 0
and O 0
the O 0
different O 0
soluble O 0
nutrients O 0
are O 0
translocated O 0
to O 0
the O 0
scutellum O 0
through O 0
epithelial O 0
cells. O 0

Then, O 0
the O 0
reserves O 0
are O 0
directed O 0
to O 0
the O 0
embryo O 0
axis O 0
to O 0
sustain O 0
its O 0
growth. O 0

Therefore, O 0
the O 0
microenvironment O 0
surrounding O 0
the O 0
scutellum O 0
modulates O 0
its O 0
function. O 0

Zinc O 0
(Zn) O 0
is O 0
a O 0
micronutrient O 0
stored O 0
in O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
scutellum O 0
and O 0
endosperm; O 0
during O 0
imbibition, O 0
Zn O 0
from O 0
the O 0
endosperm O 0
is O 0
solubilized O 0
and O 0
mobilized O 0
towards O 0
the O 0
scutellum. O 0

During O 0
this O 0
process, O 0
Zn O 0
first O 0
becomes O 0
concentrated O 0
and O 0
interacts O 0
with O 0
cell O 0
wall O 0
charges, O 0
after O 0
which O 0
excess O 0
Zn O 0
is O 0
internalized O 0

Currently, O 0

on O 0
the O 0
scutellum O 0

In O 0

that, O 0

In O 0
this O 0

proteins O 0

We O 0
performed O 0
a O 0

screening O 0
of O 0
lectin O 0

in O 0
the O 0
Zea O 0

at O 0
different O 0

This O 0
allowed O 0
us O 0
to O 0
obtain O 0
306 O 0
gene O 0

encoding O 0
putative O 0

Among O 0
the O 0

was O 0
high O 0
and O 0

in O 0

Thus, O 0
a O 0
set O 0

was O 0
identified O 0
with O 0

these O 0

reach O 0
the O 0

Among O 0
the O 0
metal O 0

zinc O 0
(Zn) O 0
and O 0
lead O 0
(Pb) O 0
are O 0
common O 0
co-pollutants O 0
from O 0
anthropogenic O 0

Thus, O 0
we O 0
sought O 0
to O 0
define O 0
the O 0
accumulation O 0
of O 0
Zn O 0
and O 0
Pb O 0
in O 0

Concentrations O 0
of O 0

in O 0
agricultural O 0

(in O 0

could O 0
reach O 0
3015 O 0

whereas O 0
concentrations O 0
of O 0
Zn O 0
in O 0

(in O 0

could O 0
reach O 0
1140 O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
the O 0
maximum O 0

of O 0
Zn O 0
and O 0

were O 0
27,870 O 0
and O 0
2020 O 0

and O 0
4180 O 0
and O 0
6320 O 0

respectively. O 0

Recent O 0

have O 0
shown O 0
that O 0

(such O 0

can O 0
play O 0
important O 0
roles O 0
in O 0
the O 0
bioavailability O 0
of O 0

We O 0
also O 0
investigated O 0
some O 0
of O 0
the O 0

involved O 0
in O 0

become O 0
an O 0

in O 0

Further, O 0
we O 0
identify O 0
two O 0

in O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

a O 0

that O 0
encodes O 0
an O 0

ZmEXPB15. O 0

The O 0

is O 0
expressed O 0

We O 0

(TFs), O 0
ZmNAC11 O 0

Accordingly, O 0
these O 0

Together, O 0
we O 0

Background: O 0
Cytoplasmic O 0
male O 1

(CMS) O 0
is O 0
a O 0
trait O 0
of O 0
economic O 0
importance O 0
in O 0
the O 0
production O 0
of O 0

In O 0
CMS-S O 0

appear O 0
frequently O 0
in O 0

female O 0
populations O 0
where O 0
only O 0
complete O 0

were O 0
expected. O 0

It O 0
has O 0
been O 0
reported O 0
that O 0
these O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

is O 0
largely O 0

Results: O 0
In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
determined O 0
the O 0
ratio O 0
of O 0
plants O 0
carrying O 0
exerted O 0
anthers O 0
in O 0
the O 0
population O 0
of O 0
two O 0
CMS-S O 0
subtypes. O 0

The O 0
subtype O 0
with O 0
a O 0
high O 0
ratio O 0
of O 0
exerted O 0
anthers O 0
was O 0
designated O 0
as O 0
CMS-Sa, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
other O 0
with O 0
low O 0
ratio O 0
was O 0
designated O 0
as O 0
CMS-Sb. O 0

Through O 0
next-generation O 0
sequencing, O 0
we O 0
assembled O 0
and O 0
compared O 0
mitochondrial O 0
genomes O 0
of O 0
two O 0
CMS-S O 0
subtypes. O 0

Phylogenetic O 0
analyses O 0
revealed O 0
strong O 0
similarities O 0
between O 0
the O 0
two O 0
mitochondrial O 0

The O 0
sterility-associated O 0
regions, O 0
S O 0
plasmids, O 0
and O 0
terminal O 0
inverted O 0
repeats O 0
(TIRs) O 0
were O 0
intact O 0
in O 0
both O 0

The O 0
two O 0

maintained O 0
high O 0
transcript O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
the O 0
sterility O 0
gene O 0
orf355 O 0
in O 0
anther O 0

Most O 0
of O 0
the O 0

were O 0
identical O 0
at O 0
the O 0

and O 0

in O 0
the O 0
two O 0
subtypes, O 0
except O 0
for O 0
NADH O 0

(nad1). O 0

In O 0
the O 0
mitochondrial O 0
genome O 0
of O 0
CMS-Sb, O 0
a O 0
3.3-kilobase O 0
sequence O 0
containing O 0
nad1-exon1 O 0
was O 0
absent O 0
from O 0
the O 0
second O 0
copy O 0
of O 0
the O 0
17-kb O 0

region. O 0

Consequently, O 0
we O 0
detected O 0
two O 0
copies O 0
of O 0
nad1-exon1 O 0
in O 0
CMS-Sa, O 0
but O 0
only O 0
one O 0
copy O 0
in O 0
CMS-Sb. O 0

During O 0
pollen O 0
development, O 0
nad1 O 0
transcription O 0
and O 0
mitochondrial O 0
biogenesis O 0
were O 0
induced O 0
in O 0
anthers O 0
of O 0
CMS-Sa, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
in O 0
those O 0
of O 0
CMS-Sb. O 0

We O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
the O 0
impaired O 0
mitochondrial O 0
function O 0
in O 0
the O 0
anthers O 0
of O 0
CMS-Sb O 0
is O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
its O 0

This O 0

To O 0

and O 0
has O 0
been O 0
extensively O 0

in O 0

The O 0
molecular O 0

remain O 0
largely O 0

but O 0
considerable O 0
progress O 0
has O 0

made O 0
in O 0
this O 0

in O 0
recent O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
summarize O 0
the O 0

that O 0
have O 0
been O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
plant O 0
QDR O 0
and O 0
their O 0
biological O 0

Many O 0

belong O 0
to O 0
the O 0
canonical O 0

categories O 0
with O 0

and O 0
secondary O 0

However, O 0
other O 0
"atypical" O 0
QDR O 0
genes O 0
are O 0
predicted O 0
to O 0
be O 0
involved O 0
in O 0

that O 0

such O 0
as O 0

and O 0
others. O 0

This O 0
diversity O 0
of O 0

for O 0
QDR O 0

contrasts O 0
with O 0

for O 0
NUE O 0

that O 0
brought O 0
by O 0
an O 0

The O 0
speculation O 0
that O 0

is O 0
neglected O 0
during O 0
maize O 0

reminds O 0
us O 0
of O 0
a O 0
similar O 0
pattern O 0
that O 0
the O 0
ancient O 0

of O 0

undergone O 0
in O 0
rice, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
largely O 0
lost O 0
in O 0
modern O 0

due O 0
to O 0
the O 0

Therefore, O 0
retracing O 0

almost O 0

In O 0

In O 0

activity O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Under O 0

respectively; O 0
however, O 0
it O 0
does O 0
not O 0

In O 0

Similar O 0

It O 0
has O 0
also O 0
either O 0
no O 0

it O 0

However, O 0

In O 0
the O 0

a O 0

five O 0
ZmERD15 O 0

from O 0
the O 0

ZmERD15a, O 0
ZmERD15b, O 0

The O 0
results O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
ZmERD15 O 0

were O 0
characterized O 0
by O 0
a O 0

Besides, O 0
the O 0

that O 0
ZmERD15b O 0

were O 0
localized O 0
in O 0
the O 0

ZmERD15a O 0

The O 0
results O 0
of O 0
the O 0
quantitative O 0

(qRT-PCR) O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

the O 0
ZmERD15 O 0
genes O 0
was O 0
regulated O 0
by O 0
PEG, O 0

In O 0
summary, O 0
a O 0
comprehensive O 0

ZmERD15s O 0
was O 0
conducted O 0
in O 0

Domestication O 0
affected O 0
the O 0

of O 0
maize O 0
root O 0

more O 0
than O 0
northward O 0

and O 0
modern O 0

and O 0
herbivore O 0
preference O 0
for O 0
roots O 0
was O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
volatile O 0
diversity O 0
and O 0
herbivore O 0
resistance. O 0

Studies O 0
show O 0
that O 0
herbivore O 0
defenses O 0
in O 0
crops O 0
are O 0
mediated O 0
by O 0
domestication, O 0
spread, O 0
and O 0
breeding, O 0
among O 0
other O 0
human-driven O 0
processes. O 0

They O 0
also O 0
show O 0
that O 0
those O 0
processes O 0
affected O 0
chemical O 0
communication O 0
between O 0
crop O 0
plants O 0
and O 0
herbivores. O 0

We O 0
hypothesized O 0
that O 0
(i) O 0
preference O 0
of O 0
the O 0
herbivore O 0
(Diabrotica O 0
virgifera O 0
virgifera) O 0
larvae O 0
for O 0
embryonic O 0
roots O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0
mays O 0
mays) O 0
would O 0
increase O 0
and O 0
(ii) O 0
root O 0
volatile O 0
diversity O 0
would O 0
decrease O 0
with O 0
the O 0
crop's O 0
domestication, O 0
northward O 0
spread O 0
to O 0
present-day O 0
USA, O 0
and O 0
modern O 0
breeding. O 0

We O 0
used O 0
Balsas O 0
teosinte O 0
(Zea O 0
mays O 0
parviglumis), O 0
Mexican O 0
and O 0
USA O 0
landrace O 0
maizes, O 0
and O 0
US O 0
inbred O 0
maize O 0
lines O 0
to O 0
test O 0
these O 0
hypotheses. O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
herbivore O 0
preference O 0
and O 0
volatile O 0
diversity O 0
increased O 0
with O 0
maize O 0
domestication O 0
and O 0
northward O 0
spread O 0
but O 0
decreased O 0
with O 0
modern O 0
breeding. O 0

Additionally, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0
abundances O 0
of O 0
single O 0
volatiles O 0
did O 0
not O 0
consistently O 0
increase O 0
or O 0
decrease O 0
with O 0
maize O 0
domestication, O 0
spread, O 0
and O 0
breeding; O 0
rather, O 0
volatiles O 0
grouped O 0
per O 0
their O 0
abundances O 0
were O 0
differentially O 0
affected O 0
by O 0
those O 0
processes, O 0
and O 0
domestication O 0
had O 0
the O 0
greatest O 0
effects. O 0

Altogether, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
suggested O 0
that: O 0
the O 0
herbivore's O 0
preference O 0
for O 0
maize O 0
roots O 0
is O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
volatile O 0
diversity O 0
and O 0
herbivore O 0
resistance; O 0
changes O 0
in O 0
abundances O 0
of O 0
individual O 0
volatiles O 0
are O 0
evident O 0
at O 0
the O 0
level O 0
of O 0
volatile O 0
groups; O 0
and O 0
maize O 0
domestication, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
spread O 0
and O 0
breeding, O 0
affected O 0
the O 0
abundances O 0
of O 0
some O 0
green O 0
leaf O 0
volatiles O 0
and O 0
sesquiterpenes/sesquiterpenoids. O 0

In O 0
part, O 0
we O 0
discussed O 0
our O 0
results O 0
in O 0
the O 0
context O 0
of O 0
herbivore O 0

evolution O 0
when O 0
resources O 0
for O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0
and O 0

vary O 0
across O 0
environments. O 0

We O 0
suggested O 0
that O 0
variability O 0
in O 0
relative O 0
abundance O 0
of O 0
volatiles O 0
may O 0
be O 0
associated O 0
with O 0

Background: O 0
In-vivo O 0

as O 0
the O 0

gene O 0
governing O 0
anthocyanin O 0

in O 0
the O 0
endosperm O 0
and O 0

is O 0
widely O 0
used O 0
to O 0
identify O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
expression O 0

R1-nj O 0
depends O 0
on O 0
genetic-background O 0
of O 0
source-germplasm O 0
used O 0
for O 0
deriving O 0
DH-lines. O 0

Further, O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
C1-Inhibitor O 0
(C1-I) O 0
gene O 0
suppresses O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
R1-nj, O 0
thus O 0
makes O 0
the O 0
selection O 0
of O 0
haploids O 0
difficult. O 0

Methods: O 0
In O 0
the O 0
present O 0
study, O 0
178 O 0
subtropically-adapted O 0
maize O 0
inbreds O 0
were O 0
crossed O 0
with O 0
two O 0
R1-nj O 0

'that O 0

Of O 0
these, O 0
76.4% O 0
inbreds O 0
developed O 0
purple O 0

in O 0
endosperm, O 0
while O 0
23.6% O 0
did O 0
not O 0
show O 0
any O 0

In O 0
case O 0
of O 0
scutellum, O 0
62.9% O 0
inbreds O 0
possessed O 0
colour O 0
and O 0
37.1% O 0
were O 0
colourless. O 0

The O 0
anthocyanin O 0
intensity O 0
varied O 0
greatly, O 0
with O 0
19.66% O 0
and O 0
42.98% O 0
inbreds O 0
displayed O 0
the O 0
least O 0
intensity, O 0
while O 0
16.85% O 0
and O 0
0.84% O 0
inbreds O 0
showed O 0
the O 0
highest O 0
intensity O 0
in O 0
endosperm O 0
and O 0
scutellum, O 0
respectively. O 0

Two O 0
C1-I O 0
specific O 0
breeder-friendly O 0

(MGU-CI-InDel8 O 0

InDel O 0
and O 0
(ii) O 0
A O 0

respectively, O 0
were O 0
developed. O 0

MGU-CI-InDel8 O 0
and O 0
MGU-C1-SNP1 O 0

predicted O 0

of O 0
C1-I O 0

with O 0
92.9% O 0
and O 0
84.7% O 0

respectively. O 0

However, O 0
when O 0
both O 0
markers O 0
were O 0
considered O 0
together, O 0
they O 0
provided O 0
100% O 0

Conclusions: O 0
These O 0
markers O 0
of O 0

The O 0

one O 0
of O 0

Remodeling O 0
of O 0
the O 0

required O 0
profound O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
underlying O 0
mechanisms O 0
remain O 0

and O 0
can O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
a O 0
more O 0
complete O 0

involves O 0
strigolactones O 0
(SLs), O 0
and O 0
that O 0
these O 0
are O 0
prominent O 0

not O 0

three O 0

The O 0

mutants, O 0
in O 0
addition O 0
to O 0
modulating O 0
the O 0

also O 0
reshaped O 0
kernel-bearing O 0
pedicels O 0

in O 0
a O 0

Genetic O 0
and O 0

are O 0
consistent O 0
with O 0

Roles O 0
of O 0
the O 0

extend O 0
to O 0

Collectively, O 0
our O 0

The O 0

Here, O 0
two O 0

Both O 0

In O 0

Moreover, O 0

is O 0
a O 0
complex O 0
trait O 0
affected O 0
by O 0
both O 0

With O 0
the O 0

including O 0
both O 0
biological O 0

We O 0

summarize O 0
the O 0

we O 0
discuss O 0
how O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
it O 0

in O 0
the O 0

(HSR). O 0

Herein, O 0
maize O 0

were O 0
pretreated O 0
with O 0
various O 0
concentrations O 0

It O 0
was O 0
found O 0
that O 0
SO2 O 0
pretreatment O 0
greatly O 0
improved O 0
the O 0
thermotolerance O 0
of O 0
maize O 0

The O 0
SO2-pretreated O 0
seedlings O 0
showed O 0
30-40% O 0
lower O 0
ROS O 0

and O 0
membrane O 0
peroxidation, O 0
but O 0
55-110% O 0
higher O 0

Interestingly, O 0
endogenous O 0

were O 0
increased O 0
by O 0
∼85% O 0
in O 0
SO2-pretreated O 0
seedlings, O 0
as O 0
revealed O 0
by O 0
phytohormone O 0

Furthermore, O 0
the O 0
SA O 0
biosynthesis O 0
inhibitor O 0
paclobutrazol O 0
markedly O 0
reduced O 0
SA O 0
levels O 0
and O 0
attenuated O 0
SO2-triggered O 0

Meanwhile, O 0
transcripts O 0

and O 0
heat O 0
stress-responsive O 0
genes O 0
in O 0
SO2-pretreated O 0
seedlings O 0
were O 0
significantly O 0
elevated O 0
under O 0
HS. O 0

These O 0
data O 0
have O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
SO2 O 0
pretreatment O 0
increased O 0
endogenous O 0
SA O 0
levels, O 0
which O 0
activated O 0
the O 0
antioxidant O 0
machinery O 0
and O 0
strengthened O 0

Therefore, O 0
this O 0

were O 0
investigated O 0
using O 0

Results O 0
revealed O 0
a O 0
high O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
type O 0
and O 0
the O 0

All O 0
maize O 0

had O 0
hydroxybenzoic O 0
and O 0
hydroxycinnamic O 0

in O 0
their O 0

Flavonoids O 0
such O 0
as O 0
luteolin O 0

and O 0
anthocyanins O 0
were O 0
specific O 0
in O 0
the O 0
orange O 0

respectively. O 0

The O 0
orange O 0

showed O 0
higher O 0
phenolic O 0

than O 0
the O 0

Xanthophylls O 0
(lutein, O 0

were O 0
detected O 0
in O 0
all O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

showed O 0
the O 0
highest O 0

(3.19-5.87 O 0

decreased O 0
with O 0

In O 0
relation O 0
to O 0
the O 0

The O 0

types, O 0
but O 0
it O 0
decreased O 0
with O 0
the O 0

in O 0
plants O 0
grown O 0
with O 0
a O 0

was O 0
seen O 0
in O 0
the O 0

in O 0
which O 0
the O 0

whereas O 0
no O 0
difference O 0
in O 0
aromatic O 0

RNA-sequencing O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
suberin O 0
biosynthesis O 0

were O 0
upregulated O 0
in O 0
low O 0

treatment, O 0
which O 0
correlated O 0

with O 0
the O 0
increased O 0

Bioimaging O 0
and O 0
xylem O 0

The O 0

suberization O 0
in O 0
crown O 0
roots O 0
of O 0
plants O 0
grown O 0
in O 0

Also, O 0
under O 0

the O 0

gene O 0
ZmNramp5 O 0
was O 0
upregulated O 0
in O 0
the O 0

These O 0
results O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
high O 0

We O 0
explored O 0
the O 0

We O 0
found O 0

Within O 0

They O 0

In O 0

the O 0

We O 0
estimated O 0
the O 0

of O 0
KNR6 O 0
and O 0
four O 0
known O 0
flowering O 1
genes, O 0
ZmCCT9, O 0

on O 0

in O 0
a O 0
diverse O 0
maize O 0
population O 0
containing O 0
508 O 0

As O 0
expected, O 0
all O 0
genes O 0
had O 0
strong O 0
effects O 0
on O 0
flowering O 1

and O 0
only O 0
KNR6 O 0
had O 0
a O 0
trade-off O 0

on O 0

(Figure O 0

Notably, O 0
the O 0
early-flowering O 0
allele O 0
of O 0
VGT1 O 0
still O 0
promoted O 0
flowering O 1
by O 0
2.1 O 0
days O 0
when O 0
the O 0
early O 0

of O 0
ZmCCT9 O 0
and O 0

were O 0

the O 0

with O 0
long-ear/late-flowering O 0
KNR6TE− O 0
allele O 0
of O 0
KNR6 O 0
(Figure O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0
early-flowering O 0
alleles O 0
of O 0
VGT1, O 0
ZmCCT9 O 0
and O 0
ZmCCT10 O 0
were O 0
not O 0

in O 0
modern O 0

Thus, O 0
we O 0
proposed O 0
an O 0
operational O 0
strategy, O 0
as O 0

in O 0
two O 0

Collectively, O 0
we O 0

that O 0

Sweetcorn O 0
is O 0
a O 0

However, O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

Both O 0

The O 0

The O 0

We O 0
propose O 0
that O 0

Thus, O 0

thus O 0
be O 0

In O 0
a O 0

the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

Additionally, O 0
two O 0

The O 0

Notably, O 0

that O 0
the O 0

However, O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

the O 0

a O 0

ZmRR1 O 0
undergoes O 0

leading O 0
to O 0
the O 0

subsequently O 0
ZmHP2-mediated O 0

improves O 0

primarily O 0
by O 0
promoting O 0

Next, O 0
we O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
ZmMATE29 O 0
is O 0
transcriptionally O 0
upregulated O 0
by O 0
ZmHP2-mediated O 0

under O 0
highly O 0

encodes O 0
a O 0

that O 0
promotes O 0

Our O 0

provides O 0
an O 0

promotion O 0
of O 0

Therefore, O 0
genetic O 0
modification O 0
to O 0
promote O 0
Cl- O 0

is O 0
a O 0

Maize O 0
phytocytokines O 0
modulate O 0
pro-survival O 0
host O 0
responses O 0
and O 0
pathogen O 0
resistance. O 0

Phytocytokines O 0
are O 0
signalling O 0
peptides O 0
that O 0
alarm O 0
plant O 0
cells O 0
of O 0
danger. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
downstream O 0
responses O 0
triggered O 0
by O 0
phytocytokines O 0
and O 0
their O 0
effect O 0
on O 0
plant O 0
survival O 0
are O 0
still O 0
largely O 0
unknown. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
have O 0
identified O 0
three O 0
biologically O 0
active O 0
maize O 0
orthologues O 0
of O 0
phytocytokines O 0
previously O 0
described O 0
in O 0
other O 0
plants. O 0

The O 0
maize O 0
phytocytokines O 0
show O 0
common O 0
features O 0
with O 0
microbe-associated O 0
molecular O 0
patterns O 0
(MAMPs), O 0
including O 0
the O 0
induction O 0
of O 0
immune-related O 0
genes O 0
and O 0
activation O 0
of O 0
papain-like O 0
cysteine O 0
proteases. O 0

In O 0
contrast O 0
to O 0
MAMPs, O 0
phytocytokines O 0
do O 0
not O 0
promote O 0
cell O 0
death O 0
in O 0
the O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
wounding. O 0

In O 0
infection O 0
assays O 0
with O 0
two O 0
fungal O 0
pathogens O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
phytocytokines O 0
affect O 0
the O 0
development O 0
of O 0
disease O 0
symptoms, O 0
likely O 0
due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
activation O 0
of O 0
phytohormonal O 0
pathways. O 0

Collectively, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
show O 0
that O 0
phytocytokines O 0
and O 0
MAMPs O 0
trigger O 0
unique O 0
and O 0
antagonistic O 0
features O 0
of O 0
immunity. O 0

We O 0
propose O 0
a O 0
model O 0
in O 0
which O 0
phytocytokines O 0
activate O 0
immune O 0
responses O 0
partially O 0
similar O 0
to O 0
MAMPs O 0
but O 0
in O 0
contrast O 0
to O 0
microbial O 0
signals, O 0
they O 0
act O 0
as O 0
danger O 0
and O 0
survival O 0
molecules O 0
to O 0
the O 0
surrounding O 0
cells. O 0

Future O 0

However, O 0

In O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

to O 0
an O 0

Further O 0

In O 0

we O 0
combined O 0

a O 0

However, O 0

Under O 0

treatment O 0
significantly O 0
increased O 0

thus, O 0
more O 0
Cr O 0

NaHS O 0

Furthermore, O 0

A O 0
major O 0

is O 0

that O 0

However, O 0

The O 0

We O 0

Maize O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
important O 0
crops, O 0
but O 0
its O 0
production O 0
is O 0
threatened O 0
by O 0
drought O 0
stress O 0
worldwide. O 0

Thus, O 0
increased O 0
drought O 1
tolerance O 1
has O 0
been O 0
a O 0
major O 0
goal O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
breeding. O 0

Conventional O 0
breeding O 0
strategies O 0
have O 0
led O 0
to O 0
significantly O 0
increase O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
yields; O 0
however, O 0
these O 0
strategies O 0
often O 0
fail O 0
to O 0
meet O 0
the O 0
need O 0
for O 0
drought O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
focus O 0
on O 0

the O 0

Moreover, O 0
recent O 0

systems, O 0
including O 0
transgenic, O 0
genome-wide O 0
marker-assisted O 0
selection, O 0
and O 0

technologies, O 0
have O 0
provided O 0
a O 0
more O 0

To O 0

this O 0

we O 0
carried O 0
out O 0
a O 0

ultimately O 0

thereby O 0

Molecular O 0

that O 0

Importantly, O 0

resulted O 0
in O 0

our O 0

However, O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
screened O 0
an O 0

which O 0
covers O 0

to O 0

Three O 0

were O 0
identified, O 0
named O 0
iqd27-1, O 0
iqd27-2, O 0

iqd27-3, O 0
and O 0
genetic O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
they O 0
were O 0

The O 0

gene O 0
in O 0
these O 0
three O 0

encodes O 0
the O 0
IQ O 0

Our O 0

showed O 0
that O 0

exhibited O 0

We O 0
propose O 0
that O 0
association O 0

However, O 0
these O 0

could O 0
not O 0
disentangle O 0

Because O 0
most O 0

are O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
report O 0

among O 0

We O 0
show O 0
that O 0

may O 0
have O 0
indirectly O 0
and O 0
inconsistently O 0
contributed O 0
to O 0
the O 0

to O 0
moderate O 0

while O 0
preserving O 0

However, O 0
our O 0

reveal O 0
the O 0
existence O 0
of O 0
a O 0
genetic O 0
tradeoff O 0
for O 0

to O 0

over O 0

Both O 0
trends O 0
are O 0
particularly O 0
conspicuous O 0
since O 0
the O 0
mid-1970s. O 0

Such O 0
a O 0

poses O 0

to O 0
the O 0
continued O 0

in O 0
the O 0

Nevertheless, O 0
given O 0
recent O 0

in O 0

We O 0

that O 0

The O 0
persistence O 0
of O 0
pistils O 0
in O 0
the O 0

can O 0
be O 0
induced O 0
by O 0

The O 0

can O 0
suppress O 0
both O 0

and O 0

We O 0

that O 0

for O 0

to O 0
affect O 0

We O 0
find O 0
that O 0
BR O 0
deficiency O 0
affects O 0
pistil O 0
persistence O 0
by O 0
an O 0
independent O 0
mechanism O 0
from O 0
the O 0

The O 0
silkless1 O 0

did O 0
not O 0
prevent O 0
the O 0

in O 0
the O 0

by O 0

in O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
there O 0
is O 0
more O 0

the O 0
silkless1 O 0
mutant O 0
than O 0
just O 0
a O 0

We O 0
document O 0

Thus, O 0
the O 0

in O 0
the O 0
tassel O 0
and O 0

maize O 0
throughout O 0
its O 0
long O 0
agricultural O 0

Results: O 0
Seeds O 0
were O 0
infected O 0
with O 0
a O 0

Although O 0
Fv O 0
infected O 0
both O 0

Discussion: O 0
These O 0
differences O 0
in O 0
the O 0

As O 0

the O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

15.07% O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
613 O 0

that O 0
were O 0

whereas O 0
contrastingly, O 0
the O 0

On O 0
the O 0
basis O 0

these O 0

Collectively, O 0
by O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
examined O 0
the O 0

Our O 0

indicates O 0
that O 0
Goss's O 0

Based O 0
on O 0

in O 0
both O 0

the O 0

namely, O 0
abscisic O 0

were O 0
markedly O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
sixty-five O 0

(up- O 0

Combining O 0

individual O 0

Maize, O 0
as O 0

but O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

the O 0

Under O 0
salt O 0

the O 0

The O 0
most O 0

was O 0
that O 0
QXH0121 O 0

In O 0
recent O 0

various O 0
automated O 0

for O 0
plant O 0

to O 0
meet O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
most O 0

are O 0
only O 0
either O 0
able O 0
to O 0
phenotype O 0

but O 0
not O 0
both O 0

This O 0
substantially O 0
limits O 0
the O 0

In O 0
order O 0
to O 0
overcome O 0
these O 0

a O 0

Thus, O 0
the O 0

is O 0
now O 0
capable O 0
of O 0
conducting O 0
high-throughput O 0
phenotyping O 0
at O 0
the O 0
whole-plant O 0

The O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
hybrid O 1

(heterosis) O 0
occurred O 0
simultaneously O 0
in O 0
roots O 0

On O 0

While O 0

(8 O 0

In O 0
contrast O 0
to O 0
TRV, O 0
TRL O 0
initially O 0
increased O 0

the O 0

This O 0

In O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

the O 0
disease O 0
known O 0
as O 0
"top O 0
rot" O 0
causes O 0

Here, O 0
to O 0

we O 0
isolated O 0
41 O 0
fungal O 0

into O 0
six O 0

based O 0
on O 0
their O 0

that O 0
this O 0

first O 0
colonizes O 0
the O 0

and O 0
then O 0

To O 0
dissect O 0
the O 0

we O 0

Under O 0
natural O 0

in O 0
Yangzhou O 0

we O 0
detected O 0
three O 0

with O 0
qRtr7-1, O 0
located O 0

Using O 0

These O 0

improve O 0
our O 0
understanding O 0
of O 0

Therefore, O 0

such O 0
is O 0

As O 0
a O 0

we O 0

Hormones O 0
played O 0
a O 0
fundamental O 0
role O 0
in O 0
improvement O 0
of O 0
yield O 1
in O 0
cereal O 0

Natural O 0
variants O 0
affecting O 0
gibberellic O 0
acid O 0
(GA) O 0
and O 0
auxin O 0
pathways O 0
were O 0
used O 0
to O 0
breed O 0
semi-dwarf O 0
varieties O 0
of O 0
rice, O 0
wheat, O 0
and O 0
sorghum, O 0
during O 0
the O 0
"Green O 0
Revolution" O 0
in O 0
the O 0
20th O 0

Since O 0
then, O 0
variants O 0

have O 0
been O 0
used O 0
to O 0
breed O 0
cereals O 0
with O 0
increased O 0
grain O 0
number. O 0

These O 0
yield O 1

were O 0
enabled O 0
by O 0
hormonal O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0
intercalary O 0
and O 0
inflorescence O 0
meristems. O 0

Recent O 0
advances O 0
have O 0
highlighted O 0
additional O 0
pathways, O 0
beyond O 0
the O 0
traditional O 0
CLAVATA-WUSCHEL O 0
pathway, O 0
in O 0
the O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0
auxin O 0
and O 0
cytokinin O 0
in O 0
inflorescence O 0
meristems, O 0
and O 0
have O 0
expanded O 0
our O 0
understanding O 0
of O 0
the O 0
role O 0
of O 0
GA O 0
in O 0
intercalary O 0

The O 0
ZmbHLH32-ZmIAA9-ZmARF1 O 0
module O 0
regulates O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize. O 0

The O 0
growth O 0
and O 0
productivity O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0
mays), O 0
along O 0
with O 0
other O 0
crop O 0
plants, O 0
can O 0
be O 0
significantly O 0
hindered O 0
by O 0
salt O 0
stress. O 0

Nevertheless, O 0
the O 0
precise O 0
molecular O 0
mechanism O 0
underlying O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize O 0
has O 0
yet O 0
to O 0
be O 0
fully O 0
elucidated. O 0

Hence, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
attempted O 0
to O 0
identify O 0
ZmIAA9, O 0
a O 0
member O 0
of O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
Aux/IAA O 0
gene O 0
family, O 0
as O 0
a O 0
positive O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
the O 0
increased O 0
ROS O 0
detoxification O 0
and O 0
elevated O 0
transcript O 0
abundances O 0
of O 0
ROS O 0
scavenging O 0
genes. O 0

Molecular O 0
and O 0
biochemical O 0
assays O 0
have O 0
provided O 0
compelling O 0
evidence O 0
that O 0
ZmbHLH32, O 0
a O 0
transcription O 0
factor O 0
belonging O 0
to O 0
the O 0
bHLH O 1
family, O 0
was O 0
capable O 0
of O 0
binding O 0
directly O 0
to O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
region O 0
of O 0
ZmIAA9, O 0
thereby O 0
activating O 0
its O 0
expression. O 0

This O 0
interaction O 0
between O 0
ZmbHLH32 O 0
and O 0
ZmIAA9 O 0
could O 0
be O 0
critical O 0
for O 0
the O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize. O 0

As O 0
expected, O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmbHLH32 O 0
led O 0
to O 0
the O 0
enhanced O 0
salt O 1
tolerance. O 1

In O 0
contrast, O 0
decreased O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
was O 0
attained O 0
after O 0
application O 0
of O 0
knockout O 0
mutants O 0
of O 0
ZmbHLH32. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
ZmARF1, O 0
which O 0
could O 0
act O 0
as O 0
a O 0
downstream O 0
of O 0
ZmIAA9, O 0
was O 0
found O 0
to O 0
physically O 0
interact O 0
with O 0
ZmIAA9 O 0
and O 0
repress O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
ROS O 0
scavenging O 0
genes. O 0

Thus, O 0
our O 0
work O 0
uncovers O 0
a O 0
novel O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
ZmbHLH32-ZmIAA9-ZmARF1 O 0
module-mediated O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize, O 0
which O 0
can O 0
be O 0
exploited O 0
for O 0
breeding O 0
salt-tolerant O 0
maize O 0
varieties. O 0

Biotic O 0
stress O 0
imposed O 0
by O 0
pathogens, O 0
including O 0
fungal, O 0
bacterial, O 0
and O 0
viral, O 0
can O 0
cause O 0
heavy O 0
damage O 0
leading O 0
to O 0
yield O 1
reduction O 0
in O 0
maize. O 0

Therefore, O 0
the O 0
identification O 0
of O 0
resistant O 0
genes O 0
paves O 0
the O 0
way O 0
to O 0
the O 0
development O 0
of O 0
disease-resistant O 0
cultivars O 0
and O 0
is O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
reliable O 0
production O 0
in O 0
maize. O 0

Identifying O 0
different O 0

patterns O 0
can O 0
deepen O 0
our O 0
perception O 0
of O 0
maize O 0

The O 0

Moreover, O 0
new O 0

about O 0
the O 0
physiological O 0

of O 0
cytoplasmic O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
disruption O 0

ZmOPR2 O 0
reduced O 0
wound-induced O 0
JA O 0
production O 0
and O 0
defense O 0
against O 0

while O 0
accumulating O 0
more O 0

Overexpression O 0
of O 0

production O 0
and O 0
defense O 0
against O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
lox10opr2 O 0
double O 0

were O 0
more O 0

than O 0
either O 0

suggesting O 0
that O 0
ZmOPR2 O 0
and O 0

uniquely O 0
and O 0
additively O 0
contributed O 0
to O 0

In O 0
contrast O 0
to O 0
the O 0
defensive O 0
roles O 0
of O 0
ZmOPR2 O 0
and O 0
ZmLOX10 O 0

Thus, O 0
ZmOPR2 O 0

inhibit O 0
the O 0

We O 0

ZmLOX10 O 0
regulate O 0

PBs/P O 0

This O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
ZmOXS2a O 0
might O 0
be O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
RNA O 0
degradation, O 0
which O 0
would O 0
also O 0
account O 0

Furthermore, O 0

are O 0
more O 0

It O 0
is O 0
likely O 0
that O 0
ZmOXS2a O 0
promotes O 0
the O 0

of O 0
the O 0

The O 0

Our O 0

thus O 0
the O 0

from O 0
the O 0

While O 0
these O 0

Introduction: O 0
The O 0
husk O 1

(HTI) O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
plays O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0

in O 0
regulating O 0
the O 0

thereby O 0
influencing O 0
the O 0

Genomic O 0
selection O 0
(GS), O 0
which O 0
employs O 0
molecular O 0

offers O 0
a O 0

approach O 0
for O 0

selecting O 0
inbred O 0

with O 0
the O 0
desired O 0
HTI O 0
trait O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
breeding. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
effectiveness O 0
of O 0
GS O 1
is O 0
contingent O 0
upon O 0
various O 0
factors, O 0
including O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0
architecture O 0
of O 0

Methods: O 0
An O 0

of O 0

was O 0
grown O 0
across O 0
three O 0

Results: O 0
The O 0
findings O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
a O 0

can O 0
aid O 0
in O 0

but O 0
not O 0

Considering O 0
the O 0
balance O 0
between O 0
GS O 1

and O 0

cost, O 0
the O 0
optimal O 0
prediction O 0
strategy O 0
is O 0
the O 0
rrBLUP O 0

the O 0

a O 0
30% O 0

and O 0
a O 0

r2=0.1. O 0

Additionally, O 0

The O 0
determination O 0
of O 0
the O 0

that O 0
promote O 0

During O 0
the O 0

there O 0
is O 0
a O 0

The O 0
biocontrol O 0

was O 0
done O 0
in O 0
two O 0
ways, O 0
the O 0
first O 0
was O 0
by O 0
observing O 0
the O 0
growth O 0

of O 0
both O 0

in O 0
a O 0

The O 0

one O 0
by O 0
analyzing O 0
the O 0

In O 0
a O 0

T. O 0

asperellum O 0
showed O 0

against O 0
F. O 0

In O 0
the O 0

even O 0
after O 0

Additionally, O 0
the O 0
T. O 0

asperellum O 0

had O 0
longer O 0

than O 0
the O 0

were O 0
analyzed O 0
by O 0

Both O 0

affect O 0
the O 0

T. O 0

asperellum O 0
increases O 0
the O 0

On O 0
the O 0
contrary, O 0
F. O 0

verticillioides O 0
reduces O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Our O 0

is O 0
able O 0
to O 0

From O 0

For O 0

the O 0

Thus, O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
exploit O 0
the O 0

obtained O 0
from O 0
four O 0

To O 0

We O 0

Furthermore, O 0

Altogether, O 0

for O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

are O 0
still O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
used O 0
molecular O 0
and O 0
genetic O 0
studies O 0
together O 0
to O 0
show O 0
that O 0
ZmELF3.1 O 0
plays O 0
a O 0
critical O 0
role O 0
in O 0
regulating O 0

Previous O 0

showed O 0
that O 0

ZmELF4 O 0

regulate O 0

and O 0
that O 0
RA2 O 0

TSH4 O 0
(ZmSBP2) O 0
suppresses O 0
and O 0
promotes O 0
TBN O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
respectively. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
loss-of-function O 0
mutants O 0
of O 0
ZmELF3.1 O 0
exhibit O 0
a O 0
significant O 0
increase O 0
of O 0
TBN. O 0

We O 0
also O 0
show O 0
that O 0
RA2 O 0
directly O 0
binds O 0
to O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
of O 0
TSH4 O 0
and O 0
represses O 0
its O 0

thus O 0
leading O 0
to O 0
reduced O 0
TBN. O 0

We O 0
further O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
ZmELF3.1 O 0
directly O 0
interacts O 0
with O 0
both O 0
RA2 O 0
and O 0
ZmELF4.2 O 0
to O 0
form O 0
tri-protein O 0

that O 0
further O 0
enhance O 0
the O 0
binding O 0
of O 0
RA2 O 0
to O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
of O 0
TSH4, O 0
leading O 0
to O 0
suppressed O 0
TSH4 O 0
expression O 0
and O 0
consequently O 0
decreased O 0
TBN. O 0

Our O 0

Although O 0
two O 0

To O 0

we O 0

We O 0

This O 0

whose O 0
role O 0
in O 0

QTL O 0
with O 0

were O 0

on O 0
six O 0

the O 0
ten O 0

confirming O 0
the O 0

These O 0

To O 0

identified O 0
that O 0

is O 0
mainly O 0

As O 0

Accordingly, O 0
we O 0
isolated O 0
DEK56 O 0
through O 0
a O 0

Through O 0
a O 0

we O 0
hypothesized O 0
that O 0

In O 0
this O 0

We O 0
also O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0

By O 0

we O 0

We O 0
observed O 0

Comprehensive O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0

Results: O 0
In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
a O 0
total O 0
of O 0
7,919 O 0
differentially O 0
expressed O 0
genes O 0
(DEGs) O 0
were O 0
analyzed, O 0
2,554 O 0
DEGs O 0
of O 0
which O 0
were O 0
found O 0
to O 0
be O 0
common O 0
under O 0
two O 0
treatments. O 0

These O 0
identified O 0
DEGs O 0
were O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
various O 0
biological O 0
processes, O 0
including O 0
DNA O 0
methylation, O 0
lipid O 0
metabolism O 0
and O 0
ROS O 0

Further O 0
investigations O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
inhibition O 0
of O 0
DNA O 0
methyltransferases O 0
prevented O 0
aleurone O 0

suggesting O 0
that O 0
active O 0
DNA O 0

plays O 0
a O 0
role O 0
in O 0

but O 0
this O 0

was O 0
not O 0
affected O 0
by O 0
DNA O 0

However, O 0
DNA O 0
methylation O 0

could O 0
regulate O 0

and O 0
inhibit O 0

Conclusion: O 0
Overall, O 0
linking O 0
of O 0
lipoxygenase, O 0
DNA O 0
methylation, O 0
and O 0
H2O2 O 0
may O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
GA-induced O 0
higher O 0
HDAC O 0

in O 0
aleurones O 0
causes O 0
breakdown O 0

and O 0
increased O 0
DNA O 0

thus, O 0
DNA O 0

indicating O 0
that O 0
these O 0

mimics O 0
the O 0

Background: O 0
Pre-exposing O 0

This O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
three O 0

an O 0

All O 0
GW O 0
QTL O 0
had O 0
small O 0
effects, O 0
confirming O 0
that O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
GW O 0
is O 0
highly O 0

We O 0
report O 0
several O 0

4.06, O 0
4.08, O 0

Together, O 0
these O 0
findings O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
disease O 0
QTL O 0
distribution O 0
is O 0
not O 0

Furthermore, O 0

bacterial O 0
and O 0
fungal O 0
diseases O 0
are O 0
not O 0
entirely O 0

and O 0
we O 0
identified O 0

resistant O 0
to O 0
both O 0

as O 0
well O 0
as O 0

Introduction: O 0
The O 0
photosynthetic O 0
electron O 0
transport O 0
chain O 0
(ETC) O 0
is O 0
the O 0
bridge O 0
that O 0
links O 0
energy O 0

during O 0
the O 0

end O 1
and O 0
energy O 0
consumption O 0
during O 0
the O 0
biochemical O 0
reactions O 0
at O 0
the O 0
other. O 0

Its O 0
functioning O 0
is O 0
thus O 0
fundamental O 0
for O 0
the O 0
proper O 0
balance O 0
between O 0
energy O 0
supply O 0
and O 0
demand O 0
in O 0
photosynthesis. O 0

Currently, O 0
there O 0
is O 0
a O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
understanding O 0
regarding O 0
how O 0
the O 0
structural O 0
properties O 0
of O 0
the O 0
ETC O 0
are O 0
affected O 0
by O 0
nutrient O 0
availability O 0
and O 0
plant O 0
developmental O 0
stages, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
a O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0

these O 0
photochemical O 0

varied O 0
with O 0

These O 0

may O 0
be O 0

either O 0

Also, O 0
the O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

The O 0

was O 0
dramatically O 0
induced O 0
by O 0

Accordingly, O 0

Climate O 0

Thereby, O 0
a O 0
holistic O 0

is O 0
important O 0

Thus, O 0
we O 0
reconstructed O 0
the O 0

Furthermore, O 0
implementing O 0

While O 0
both O 0

had O 0
reducing O 0

heat O 0

had O 0

We O 0

Thus, O 0
a O 0

can O 0
be O 0
engineered O 0
by O 0
leveraging O 0
the O 0

We O 0

To O 0

this, O 0
genetic O 0

To O 0

the O 0
four O 0

Composite O 0

was O 0
conducted O 0

A O 0

Additionally, O 0
seven O 0

Maize. O 0

Drought-induced O 0
leaf O 0
senescence O 0
is O 0
related O 0
to O 0
high O 0
sugar O 0
levels, O 0
which O 0
bears O 0
resemblance O 0
to O 0
the O 0
syndrome O 0
of O 0
diabetes O 0
in O 0
human. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
underlying O 0
mechanisms O 0
of O 0
plant O 0
diabetes O 0
on O 0
carbon O 0
imbalance O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
and O 0
corresponding O 0
detoxification O 0
strategy O 0
have O 0
not O 0
been O 0
well-understood. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
investigate O 0
the O 0
regulatory O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
exogenous O 0
MG O 0
on O 0
plant O 0
diabetes O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
stress O 0
through O 0
foliar O 0
spraying O 0
application O 0
during O 0
grain-filling O 0
stage. O 0

Results O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
exogenous O 0
MG O 0
delayed O 0
leaf O 0
senescence O 0
and O 0
promoted O 0
photoassimilation, O 0
thereby O 0
retrieving O 0
14% O 0
drought-induced O 0
yield O 1
loss. O 0

Transcriptome O 0
and O 0
metabolite O 0
analyses O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
drought O 0
increased O 0
sugar O 0
accumulation O 0
in O 0
leaf O 1
with O 1
inhibition O 0
of O 0
sugar O 0
transporters O 0
facilitating O 0
phloem O 0
loading. O 0

This O 0
led O 0
to O 0
disequilibrium O 0
of O 0
glycolysis O 0
and O 0
over-accumulation O 0
of O 0
endogenous O 0
MG. O 0

Contrarily, O 0
exogenous O 0
MG O 0
upregulated O 0
glycolytic O 0
flux O 0
and O 0
glyoxalase O 0
system O 0
catabolizing O 0
endogenous O 0
MG O 0
and O 0
advanced O 0
glycation O 0
end-products, O 0
ultimately O 0
alleviating O 0
plant O 0
diabetes. O 0

Besides, O 0
the O 0
genes O 0
facilitating O 0
anabolism O 0
and O 0
catabolism O 0
of O 0
trehalose-6-phosphate O 0
were O 0
promoted O 0
and O 0
suppressed O 0
by O 0
drought, O 0
respectively, O 0
whereas O 0
exogenous O 0
MG O 0
reversed O 0
this O 0
effect, O 0
implying O 0
trehalose-6-phosphate O 0

that O 0
play O 0
significant O 0
roles O 0
in O 0
plant O 0

However, O 0
available O 0
information O 0
regarding O 0
stress-related O 0
ABC O 0

in O 0
maize O 0
is O 0
minimal. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
a O 0
maize O 0
ABC O 0

ZmMRPA6, O 0
was O 0
identified O 0
through O 0

During O 0
germination O 0
and O 0

the O 0
zmmrpa6 O 0
mutant O 0
exhibited O 0
enhanced O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
cold O 0
or O 0

Mutated O 0
of O 0

did O 0
not O 0
affect O 0
the O 0

Meanwhile, O 0
the O 0

which O 0
lack O 0
the O 0
ZmMRPA6 O 0

were O 0
sensitive O 0
to O 0

These O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0
ZmMRPA6 O 0
and O 0
its O 0
homologous O 0
genes O 0
play O 0
a O 0
conserved O 0
role O 0
in O 0
cold O 0

and O 0
functional O 0

occurs O 0
in O 0
monocotyledonous O 0

In O 0
summary, O 0
these O 0
findings O 0
dramatically O 0
improved O 0

is O 0
capable O 0
of O 0
suppressing O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
trade-off O 0
between O 0

turns O 0
out O 0

Several O 0

reported O 0
to O 0

which O 0
also O 0
take O 0

critical O 0
significance O 0
in O 0

In O 0
this O 0

the O 0
loss-of-function O 0
mutations O 0
of O 0

ZmGA20ox3 O 0
were O 0
produced O 0
using O 0
the O 0

in O 0
maize. O 0

As O 0
indicated O 0
by O 0
the O 0
result O 0
of O 0
2-year O 0
field O 0
trials, O 0
the O 0
above-mentioned O 0
mutants O 0
displayed O 0
semi-dwarfing O 0

with O 0
the O 0

Interestingly, O 0
as O 0
revealed O 0
by O 0
the O 0

(DEGs) O 0
were O 0
notably O 0
enriched O 0
in O 0
abiotic O 0

and O 0
biochemical O 0

indicated O 0
the O 0
significantly O 0
increased O 0
ABA, O 0

and O 0
DIMBOA O 0

suggesting O 0
that O 0
ZmGA20ox3 O 0
may O 0
take O 0

vital O 0
significance O 0
in O 0

The O 0
in-depth O 0
analysis O 0
suggested O 0
that O 0
the O 0
loss O 0

of O 0
ZmGA20ox3 O 0
can O 0
enhance O 0

The O 0
results O 0
of O 0
this O 0
study O 0
supported O 0
that O 0
regulating O 0
ZmGA20ox3 O 0
can O 0
improve O 0
plant O 1

while O 0
enhancing O 0

thus O 0
serving O 0
as O 0
a O 0

Kernel O 0

is O 0
a O 0
critical O 0
factor O 0
that O 0
essentially O 0
affects O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

In O 0
natural O 0

popcorn O 0
kernels O 0
exhibit O 0

compared O 0
to O 0

and O 0
kernel O 1
weight, O 1
which O 0
is O 0
controlled O 0
by O 0
multiple O 0
genetic O 0

varies O 0
widely. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
characterized O 0
a O 0

chromosome O 1

responsible O 0
for O 0
controlling O 0
kernel O 1

(qKW1) O 0
and O 0

The O 0
qKW1 O 0
locus O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0
protein O 0
containing O 0
a O 0

The O 0
presence O 0
and O 0
function O 0
of O 0
qKW1 O 0
were O 0
confirmed O 0
through O 0
ZmKW1 O 0

where O 0
the O 0
mutations O 0
in O 0
ZmKW1 O 0
within O 0
dent O 0
corn O 0
significantly O 0
increased O 0
kernel O 1
weight, O 1
consistent O 0
with O 0
alterations O 0
in O 0
kernel O 1
size, O 1
while O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmKW1 O 0
had O 0
the O 0
opposite O 0
effect. O 0

ZmKW1 O 0
acts O 0
as O 0
a O 0
negative O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
kernel O 1

by O 0
reducing O 0
both O 0
the O 0

Notably, O 0
the O 0
popcorn O 0
allele O 0
qKW1N O 0
and O 0
the O 0
dent O 0
corn O 0
allele O 0
qKW1D O 0
encode O 0
identical O 0
proteins; O 0
however, O 0
the O 0
differences O 0
in O 0

arise O 0
due O 0

Conclusions: O 0
This O 0
study O 0
illuminates O 0
the O 0
mechanisms O 0
underlying O 0
the O 0
response O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
seedlings O 0
to O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

Especially, O 0
it O 0
identifies O 0
novel O 0
candidate O 0
genes O 0
and O 0
metabolites, O 0
enriching O 0
our O 0
understanding O 0
of O 0
the O 0

The O 0
identification O 0
of O 0
distinct O 0
resistance O 0
mechanisms O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
inbred O 0

will O 0
facilitate O 0
the O 0
exploration O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
germplasm O 0
and O 0
the O 0

prediction O 0
model O 0
for O 0
imbalanced O 0
samples O 0
using O 0
hyperspectral O 0
image. O 0

Hyperspectral O 0
imaging O 0
is O 0
a O 0
key O 0
technology O 0
for O 0
non-destructive O 0
detection O 0
of O 0
seed O 1

presently O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
capability O 0
to O 0
capture O 0
variations O 0
of O 0
optical O 0
properties O 0
in O 0
seeds. O 0

As O 0
the O 0
seed O 1
vigor O 1
data O 0
depends O 0
on O 0
the O 0
actual O 0
germination O 1
rate, O 1
it O 0
inevitably O 0
results O 0
in O 0
an O 0
imbalance O 0
between O 0
positive O 0
and O 0
negative O 0
samples. O 0

Additionally, O 0
hyperspectral O 0
image O 0
(HSI) O 0
suffers O 0
from O 0
feature O 0
redundancy O 0
and O 0
collinearity O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
inclusion O 0
of O 0
hundreds O 0
of O 0
wavelengths. O 0

It O 0
also O 0
creates O 0
a O 0
challenge O 0
to O 0
extract O 0
effective O 0
wavelength O 0
information O 0
in O 0
feature O 0
selection, O 0
however, O 0
which O 0
limits O 0
the O 0
ability O 0
of O 0
deep O 0
learning O 0
to O 0
extract O 0
features O 0
from O 0
HSI O 0
and O 0
accurately O 0
predict O 0
seed O 1
vigor. O 1

Accordingly, O 0
in O 0
this O 0
paper, O 0
we O 0
proposed O 0
a O 0
Focal-WAResNet O 0
network O 0
to O 0
predict O 0
seed O 1
vigor O 1
end-to-end, O 0
which O 0
improves O 0
the O 0
network O 0
performance O 0
and O 0
feature O 0
representation O 0
capability, O 0
and O 0
improves O 0
the O 0
accuracy O 0
of O 0
seed O 1
vigor O 1
prediction. O 0

Firstly, O 0
the O 0
focal O 0
loss O 0
function O 0
is O 0
utilized O 0
to O 0
adjust O 0
the O 0
loss O 0
weights O 0
of O 0
different O 0
sample O 0
categories O 0
to O 0
solve O 0
the O 0
problem O 0
of O 0
sample O 0
imbalance. O 0

Secondly, O 0
a O 0
WAResNet O 0
network O 0
is O 0
proposed O 0
to O 0
select O 0
characteristic O 0
wavelengths O 0
and O 0
predict O 0
seed O 1
vigor O 1
end-to-end, O 0
focusing O 0
on O 0
wavelengths O 0
with O 0
higher O 0
network O 0
weights, O 0
which O 0
enhance O 0
the O 0
ability O 0
of O 0
seed O 1
vigor O 1
prediction. O 0

To O 0
validate O 0
the O 0
effectiveness O 0
of O 0
this O 0
method, O 0
this O 0
study O 0
collected O 0
HSI O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
seeds O 0
for O 0
experimental O 0
verification, O 0
providing O 0
a O 0
reference O 0
for O 0
plant O 0
breeding. O 0

The O 0
experimental O 0
results O 0
demonstrate O 0
a O 0
significant O 0
improvement O 0
in O 0
classification O 0
performance O 0
compared O 0
to O 0
other O 0
state-of-the-art O 0
methods, O 0
with O 0
an O 0
accuracy O 0
up O 0
to O 0
98.48% O 0
and O 0
an O 0
F1 O 0
score O 0
of O 0
95.9%. O 0

Temporal O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0
vegetative O 0
phase O 0
change O 0
in O 0
plants. O 0

During O 0
their O 0
vegetative O 0
growth, O 0
plants O 0
reiteratively O 0
produce O 0
leaves, O 0
buds, O 0
and O 0
internodes O 0
at O 0
the O 0
apical O 0
end O 1
of O 0
the O 0
shoot. O 0

The O 0
identity O 0
of O 0
these O 0
organs O 0
changes O 0
as O 0
the O 0
shoot O 0
develops. O 0

Some O 0
traits O 0
change O 0
gradually, O 0
but O 0
others O 0
change O 0
in O 0
a O 0
coordinated O 0
fashion, O 0
allowing O 0
shoot O 1
development O 1
to O 1
be O 0
divided O 0
into O 0
discrete O 0
juvenile O 0
and O 0
adult O 0
phases. O 0

The O 0
transition O 0
between O 0
these O 0
phases O 0
is O 0
called O 0
vegetative O 0
phase O 0
change. O 0

Historically, O 0
vegetative O 0
phase O 0
change O 0
has O 0
been O 0
studied O 0
because O 0
it O 0
is O 0
thought O 0
to O 0
be O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
an O 0
increase O 0
in O 0
reproductive O 0
competence. O 0

However, O 0
this O 0
is O 0
not O 0
true O 0
for O 0
all O 0
species; O 0
indeed, O 0
heterochronic O 0
variation O 0
in O 0
the O 0
timing O 0
of O 0
vegetative O 0
phase O 0
change O 0
and O 0
flowering O 1
has O 0
made O 0
important O 0
contributions O 0
to O 0
plant O 0
evolution. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
review, O 0
we O 0
describe O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
vegetative O 0
phase O 0
change, O 0
how O 0
the O 0
timing O 0
of O 0
this O 0
process O 0
is O 0
controlled O 0
by O 0
endogenous O 0
and O 0
environmental O 0
factors, O 0
and O 0
its O 0
ecological O 0
and O 0
evolutionary O 0
significance. O 0

The O 0
maize O 0
PLASTID O 0
TERMINAL O 0
OXIDASE O 0
(PTOX) O 0
locus O 0
controls O 0
the O 0
carotenoid O 1

of O 1

Carotenoids O 0
perform O 0
a O 0
broad O 0
range O 0
of O 0
important O 0
functions O 0
in O 0
humans; O 0
therefore, O 0
carotenoid O 0
biofortification O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0
mays O 0
L.), O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
highly O 0
produced O 0
cereal O 0
crops O 0
worldwide, O 0
would O 0
have O 0
a O 0
global O 0
impact O 0
on O 0
human O 0
health. O 0

PLASTID O 0
TERMINAL O 0
OXIDASE O 0
(PTOX) O 0
genes O 0
play O 0
an O 0
important O 0
role O 0
in O 0
carotenoid O 0
metabolism; O 0
however, O 0
the O 0
possible O 0
function O 0
of O 0
PTOX O 0
in O 0
carotenoid O 0
biosynthesis O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
has O 0
not O 0
yet O 0
been O 0
explored. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
characterized O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
PTOX O 0
locus O 0
by O 0
forward- O 0
and O 0
reverse-genetic O 0
analyses. O 0

While O 0
most O 0
higher O 0
plant O 0
species O 0
possess O 0
a O 0
single O 0
copy O 0
of O 0
the O 0
PTOX O 0
gene, O 0
maize O 0
carries O 0
two O 0
tandemly O 0
duplicated O 0
copies. O 0

Characterization O 0
of O 0
mutants O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
disruption O 0
of O 0
either O 0
copy O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
a O 0
carotenoid-deficient O 0
phenotype. O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
mutations O 0
in O 0
the O 0
PTOX O 0
genes O 0
as O 0
being O 0
causal O 0
of O 0
the O 0
classic O 0
maize O 0
mutant, O 0
albescent1. O 0

Remarkably, O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmPTOX1 O 0
significantly O 0
improved O 0
the O 0
content O 0
of O 0
carotenoids, O 0
especially O 0
β-carotene O 0
(provitamin O 0
A), O 0
which O 0
was O 0
increased O 0
by O 0
~threefold, O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
kernels. O 0

Overall, O 0
our O 0
study O 0
shows O 0
that O 0
maize O 0
PTOX O 0
locus O 0
plays O 0
an O 0
important O 0
role O 0
in O 0
carotenoid O 0
biosynthesis O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
kernels O 0
and O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
fine-tuning O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
this O 0
gene O 0
could O 0
improve O 0
the O 0
nutritional O 0
value O 0
of O 0
cereal O 0
grains. O 0

A O 0

which O 0
frequently O 0
occurs O 0
during O 0

Although O 0
the O 0

well O 0
studied, O 0
the O 0
mechanisms O 0
determining O 0
the O 0

are O 0
still O 0
unknown. O 0

Our O 0
goal O 0
is O 0
to O 0
determine O 0
the O 0
cellular O 0
basis O 0
of O 0
the O 0

during O 0

of O 0

exposed O 0

We O 0
first O 0
studied O 0
the O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
a O 0
3-day O 0
cold O 0
spell O 0
on O 0
leaf O 1

at O 1
the O 0

Then, O 0
we O 0
performed O 0
a O 0
kinematic O 0
analysis O 0
to O 0
analyse O 0
the O 0
dynamics O 0
of O 0

of O 0
the O 0
4th O 0

after O 0

Our O 0
results O 0
demonstrated O 0
cold O 0

reduced O 0
the O 0

(- O 0

This O 0
was O 0
not O 0

recovery O 0
of O 0
the O 0

This O 0
difference O 0
was O 0
due O 0
to O 0
a O 0
higher O 0
cell O 0
division O 0
rate O 0
on O 0
the O 0

Background: O 0
The O 0
Apetala O 0
2/ethylene-responsive O 0

has O 0
diverse O 0
functions O 0
that O 0
enhance O 0
development O 0
and O 0
torment O 0
resistance O 0
in O 0
the O 0
plant O 0

In O 0
variation, O 0
the O 0
ethylene-responsive O 0
factor O 0
(ERF) O 0
family O 0
of O 0
TF's O 0
genes O 0
is O 0
extensive O 0
in O 0
the O 0
crop O 0
genome. O 0

Generally, O 0
the O 0
plant-specific O 0
ethylene-responsive O 0

family O 0
may O 0
divided O 0
by O 0
the O 0
dehydration-responsive O 0
element-binding O 0

So, O 0
the O 0
AP2/ERF O 0

demonstrated O 0
the O 0
repeated O 0
AP2 O 0

The O 0

Objective: O 0
The O 0
study O 0
objective O 0
is O 0
to O 0

So, O 0
examinations O 0

Methods: O 0
Therefore, O 0
perform O 0

This O 0

So, O 0
the O 0

Conclusion: O 0
Therefore, O 0
the O 0
study O 0
concluded O 0
that O 0
the O 0

Those O 0

for O 0
the O 0

we O 0
still O 0
lack O 0
fundamental O 0

about O 0
whether O 0
and O 0
how O 0
pollen O 1

is O 1
controlled O 0
in O 0
natural O 0

We O 0
used O 0
a O 0
genome-wide O 0

(GWAS) O 0
to O 0
show O 0
that O 0
ZmGEN1A O 0

confer O 0

ZmMSH7 O 0
showed O 0
evidence O 0
of O 0

during O 0
maize O 0

and O 0
its O 0

a O 0
substantial O 0

in O 0

for O 0
both O 0

Overall, O 0
our O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
ZmFBL41 O 0

In O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0

we O 0
provide O 0

In O 0

This O 0

that O 0
the O 0

are O 0
marked O 0
by O 0

Conversely, O 0

reflecting O 0
a O 0

In O 0

Hormonal O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0

A O 0

with O 0
a O 0

Combining O 0

led O 0
to O 0
the O 0

that O 0
Zm00001d033328, O 0

however, O 0
the O 0

this O 0

remain O 0
poorly O 0
studied. O 0

Using O 0

we O 0
explored O 0

and O 0

between O 0
herbivore-attacked O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
continuous O 0

to O 0
natural O 0

of O 0

at O 0
the O 0
onset O 0
of O 0
the O 0
second O 0

of O 0
exposure. O 0

This O 0
delayed O 0
burst O 0
is O 0
not O 0
explained O 0
by O 0
terpene O 0
accumulation O 0
during O 0
the O 0
night, O 0
but O 0
coincides O 0
with O 0
delayed O 0
jasmonate O 0
accumulation O 0
in O 0
receiver O 0
plants. O 0

The O 0
delayed O 0
burst O 0
occurs O 0
independent O 0
of O 0
day:night O 0
light O 0
transitions O 0
and O 0
cannot O 0
be O 0
fully O 0
explained O 0
by O 0

Instead, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
the O 0
result O 0
of O 0
a O 0
stress O 0
memory O 0
from O 0
volatile O 0
exposure O 0
during O 0
the O 0

and O 0
secondary O 0
exposure O 0
to O 0
bioactive O 0
volatiles O 0
on O 0
the O 0
second O 0
day. O 0

Our O 0
study O 0
reveals O 0
that O 0
prolonged O 0
exposure O 0
to O 0
natural O 0
blends O 0
of O 0
stress-induced O 0
volatiles O 0
results O 0
in O 0
a O 0
response O 0
that O 0
integrates O 0

and O 0
direct O 0
induction O 0
into O 0
a O 0
distinct O 0
and O 0
predictable O 0
temporal O 0

pattern. O 0

This O 0
provides O 0
an O 0
answer O 0
to O 0
the O 0
long-standing O 0
question O 0
of O 0
whether O 0
stress O 0
volatiles O 0
predominantly O 0
induce O 0
or O 0
prime O 0
plant O 0
defenses O 0
in O 0
neighboring O 0
plants, O 0
by O 0
revealing O 0
that O 0
they O 0
can O 0
do O 0
both O 0
in O 0
sequence.Most O 0
plants O 0
are O 0
anchored O 0
to O 0
the O 0
soil O 0
by O 0
roots O 0
and O 0
need O 0
to O 0
be O 0
able O 0
to O 0
defend O 0
themselves O 0
from O 0
insects O 0
and O 0
other O 0
animal O 0
pests O 0
while O 0
remaining O 0
stationary. O 0

One O 0
way O 0
plants O 0
achieve O 0
this O 0
is O 0
to O 0
emit O 0
chemicals O 0
known O 0
as O 0
herbivore-induced O 0
plant O 0
volatiles O 0
(HIPVs) O 0
into O 0
the O 0
air O 0
when O 0
they O 0
are O 0
under O 0
attack O 0
to O 0
attract O 0
other O 0
animals O 0
that O 0
are O 0
natural O 0
enemies O 0
of O 0
the O 0
pest. O 0

Certain O 0
HIPVs O 0
also O 0
prime O 0
other O 0
nearby O 0
plants O 0
(known O 0
as O 0
‘receivers’) O 0
to O 0
be O 0
ready O 0
for O 0
an O 0
attack, O 0
or O 0
even O 0
pre-emptively O 0
activate O 0
defense O 0
responses O 0
in O 0
the O 0
plant O 0
before O 0
they O 0
encounter O 0
the O 0
pest. O 0

However, O 0
it O 0
remains O 0
unclear O 0
how O 0
the O 0
temporal O 0
patterns O 0
of O 0
HIPVs O 0
emitted O 0
from O 0
attacked O 0
plants O 0
affect O 0
how O 0
receiver O 0
plants O 0
respond O 0
to O 0
these O 0
chemicals, O 0
and O 0
how O 0
day-to-night O 0
light O 0
fluctuations O 0
impact O 0
this O 0
transfer O 0
of O 0
chemical O 0
information. O 0

To O 0
investigate O 0
this O 0
question, O 0
Waterman O 0
et O 0

exposed O 0
maize O 0
plants O 0
to O 0
a O 0
common O 0
pest O 0
caterpillar O 0
called O 0
Spodoptera O 0
exigua. O 0

Individual O 0
infested O 0
maize O 0
plants O 0
(referred O 0
to O 0
as O 0
‘senders’) O 0
were O 0
placed O 0
in O 0
transparent O 0
glass O 0
chambers O 0
that O 0
were O 0
linked O 0
by O 0
a O 0
narrow O 0
tube O 0
to O 0
a O 0
second O 0
glass O 0
chamber O 0
containing O 0
a O 0
receiver O 0
plant O 0
that O 0
had O 0
not O 0
encountered O 0
caterpillars. O 0

The O 0
team O 0
used O 0
a O 0
mass O 0
spectrometry O 0
approach O 0
to O 0
measure O 0
the O 0
HIPVs O 0
emitted O 0
by O 0
the O 0
sender O 0
plants O 0
and O 0
the O 0
responses O 0
of O 0
the O 0
receivers O 0
in O 0
real-time. O 0

The O 0
experiments O 0
found O 0
that O 0
within O 0
the O 0
first O 0
few O 0
hours O 0
of O 0
exposure O 0
to O 0
HIPVs, O 0
receiver O 0
plants O 0
had O 0
a O 0
small O 0
burst O 0
of O 0
defense O 0
activity O 0
that O 0
was O 0
followed O 0
by O 0
a O 0
far O 0
stronger O 0
burst O 0
several O 0
hours O 0
later. O 0

The O 0
second O 0
burst O 0
coincided O 0
with O 0
the O 0
accumulation O 0
of O 0
plant O 0
hormones O 0
called O 0
jasmonates O 0
in O 0
the O 0
receiver O 0
plants, O 0
and O 0
was O 0
not O 0
controlled O 0
by O 0
fluctuations O 0
in O 0
light O 0
levels. O 0

This O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
HIPVs O 0
first O 0
prime O 0
and O 0
then O 0
subsequently O 0
induce O 0
defense O 0
responses O 0
in O 0
other O 0
plants O 0
in O 0
a O 0
manner O 0
that O 0
is O 0
independent O 0
of O 0
the O 0
patterns O 0
of O 0
day O 0
and O 0
night. O 0

In O 0
the O 0
future, O 0
these O 0
findings O 0
may O 0
be O 0
used O 0
to O 0
aid O 0
in O 0
the O 0
diagnosis O 0
and O 0
monitoring O 0
of O 0

They O 0
will O 0
also O 0
help O 0

Phosphorus O 0
(P) O 0
is O 0
an O 0
essential O 0
nutrient O 0
for O 0

to O 0
clarify O 0
the O 0

In O 0
our O 0

a O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

by O 0
yeast O 0
one O 0

and O 0
found O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0

of O 0
dual O 0
luciferase O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
ZmNF-YC1 O 0
is O 0
a O 0
positive O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
ZmAPRG. O 0

Overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmNF-YC1 O 0
improved O 0
low O 0

whereas O 0

that O 0
the O 0

Meanwhile, O 0
transcriptome O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0

supplied O 0

Furthermore, O 0

While O 0
pathogens O 0
can O 0
secrete O 0

to O 0

and O 0
inhibit O 0
PLCP O 0
activities, O 0
the O 0

and O 0
the O 0
mechanisms O 0
through O 0
which O 0

neutralize O 0
PLCP O 0
activities O 0
remain O 0
largely O 0
uncharted. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
and O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
a O 0
maize O 0
PLCP O 0
CCP1 O 0
(Corn O 0

is O 0
upregulated O 0
following O 0
sugarcane O 0
mosaic O 0
virus O 0
(SCMV) O 0
infection. O 0

Transient O 0
silencing O 0
of O 0
CCP1 O 0
led O 0
to O 0
a O 0
reduction O 0
in O 0
PLCP O 0
activities, O 0
thereby O 0
promoting O 0
SCMV O 0
infection O 0
in O 0
maize. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
the O 0
knockdown O 0
of O 0
CCP1 O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
diminished O 0
salicylic O 0
acid O 0
(SA) O 0
levels O 0
and O 0
suppressed O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
SA-responsive O 0
pathogenesis-related O 0
genes. O 0

This O 0
suggests O 0
that O 0
CCP1 O 0
plays O 0
a O 0
role O 0
in O 0
modulating O 0
the O 0
SA O 0
signaling O 0
pathway. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
NIa-Pro, O 0
the O 0
primary O 0
protease O 0
of O 0
SCMV, O 0
was O 0
found O 0
to O 0
interact O 0
with O 0
CCP1, O 0
subsequently O 0
inhibiting O 0
its O 0
protease O 0
activity. O 0

A O 0
specific O 0
motif O 0
within O 0
NIa-Pro O 0
termed O 0
the O 0

motif O 0
was O 0
identified O 0
as O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
its O 0
interaction O 0
with O 0
CCP1 O 0
and O 0
the O 0
suppression O 0
of O 0
its O 0
activity. O 0

We O 0
have O 0
also O 0
discovered O 0
that O 0
the O 0
key O 0
amino O 0
acids O 0
responsible O 0
for O 0
the O 0
interaction O 0
between O 0
NIa-Pro O 0
and O 0
CCP1 O 0
are O 0
crucial O 0
for O 0
the O 0
virulence O 0
of O 0
SCMV. O 0

In O 0
conclusion, O 0
our O 0
findings O 0
offer O 0
compelling O 0
evidence O 0
that O 0
SCMV O 0
undermines O 0

through O 0
the O 0

Together, O 0
these O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
two O 0

in O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
genome, O 0
named O 0
ZmFKF1a O 0

ZmFKF1b, O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0
ZmFKF1a O 0

We O 0

that O 0
ZmFKF1b O 0
underwent O 0
artificial O 0

during O 0
modern O 0

in O 0
China O 0
probably O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0

Furthermore, O 0
our O 0

suggested O 0
that O 0
ZmFKF1bHap_C7 O 0

be O 0
an O 0

The O 0
3-dimensional O 0

is O 0
fundamental O 0
for O 0
studying O 0
functional-structural O 0

Existing O 0

To O 0

we O 0
propose O 0
a O 0
3D O 0

based O 0
on O 0
computational O 0

An O 0

is O 0
created O 0
using O 0
the O 0
t-distribution O 0

to O 0
reflect O 0
characteristics O 0
of O 0
the O 0

The O 0
subsequent O 0
model O 0
considers O 0
the O 0
3D O 0
phytomers O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
as O 0

The O 0
aim O 0
is O 0
to O 0
maximize O 0
the O 0
ratio O 0
of O 0

and O 0
by O 0
iteratively O 0

canopy O 0
model O 0
that O 0
maximizes O 0
light O 0

can O 0
be O 0

Additionally, O 0
the O 0
method O 0
incorporates O 0
a O 0

However, O 0

In O 0

the O 0

two O 0
flavonoid O 0
di-O-glycosyltransferases O 0
ZmUGT84A1 O 0

were O 0
cloned O 0
from O 0
maize O 0

expressed O 0
in O 0
Escherichia O 0

Phylogenetic O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
two O 0
enzymes O 0
were O 0
homologous O 0
to O 0
AtUGT84A1 O 0
and O 0
AtUGT84A3. O 0

The O 0
two O 0

showed O 0
a O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0
recombinant O 0
ZmUGT84A1 O 0
and O 0
ZmUGT84A2 O 0
had O 0
a O 0

The O 0
highly O 0

ZmUGT84A1 O 0

ZmUGT84A2 O 0
may O 0

By O 0

Whether O 0
and O 0
how O 0
specialized O 0

protect O 0
plants O 0
against O 0
toxic O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
trace O 0

is O 0
not O 0
well O 0
understood. O 0

We O 0
evaluated O 0
whether O 0
benzoxazinoids, O 0
which O 0
are O 0
released O 0
into O 0
the O 0
soil O 0
by O 0
major O 0
cereals, O 0
can O 0
confer O 0
protection O 0
against O 0

toxicity. O 0

Benzoxazinoid-producing O 0
maize O 0
plants O 0
performed O 0
better O 0
in O 0
arsenic-contaminated O 0
soils O 0
than O 0
benzoxazinoid-deficient O 0
mutants O 0
in O 0
the O 0
greenhouse O 0
and O 0
the O 0
field. O 0

Adding O 0
benzoxazinoids O 0
to O 0
the O 0
soil O 0
restored O 0
the O 0
protective O 0
effect, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
effect O 0
persisted O 0
to O 0
the O 0
next O 0
crop O 0
generation O 0
via O 0
positive O 0
plant-soil O 0
feedback. O 0

Arsenate O 0
levels O 0
in O 0
the O 0
soil O 0
and O 0
total O 0
arsenic O 0
levels O 0
in O 0
the O 0
roots O 0
were O 0
lower O 0
in O 0
the O 0
presence O 0
of O 0
benzoxazinoids. O 0

Thus, O 0
the O 0
protective O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
benzoxazinoids O 0
is O 0
likely O 0
soil-mediated O 0
and O 0
includes O 0
changes O 0
in O 0
soil O 0
arsenic O 0
speciation O 0
and O 0
root O 0
accumulation. O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
that O 0
exuded O 0
specialized O 0
metabolites O 0
can O 0
enhance O 0
protection O 0
against O 0
toxic O 0
trace O 0
elements O 0
via O 0
soil-mediated O 0
processes O 0
and O 0
may O 0
thereby O 0

Significance: O 0
Toxic O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
arsenic O 0
in O 0
the O 0

can O 0
substantially O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
reveal O 0
a O 0
mechanism O 0
to O 0
reduce O 0

and O 0

Benzoxazinoids, O 0

(also O 0
called O 0

produced O 0
by O 0
cereals O 0
such O 0
as O 0
wheat O 0
and O 0

can O 0
reduce O 0

and O 0
improve O 0
plant O 0
performance O 0
in O 0
the O 0

Furthermore, O 0
benzoxazinoid O 0
exudation O 0
into O 0
the O 0

enhances O 0
the O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0

Background: O 0
Molecular O 0

are O 0
important O 0
for O 0

In O 0
our O 0
previous O 0

nine O 0
ZmLAZ1 O 0
members O 0
were O 0
identified O 0
in O 0
the O 0

but O 0
the O 0
function O 0
of O 0
ZmLAZ1 O 0
was O 0
largely O 0
unknown. O 0

Results: O 0
The O 0
ZmLAZ1-3 O 0
gene O 0
was O 0
cloned O 0
from O 0
B73, O 0
and O 0
its O 0
drought-tolerant O 0
function O 0
was O 0
elucidated O 0
by O 0
expression O 0

in O 0
transgenic O 0

The O 0
expression O 0

was O 0
upregulated O 0
by O 0
drought O 0

in O 0
different O 0

The O 0

such O 0
as O 0

The O 0
results O 0

in O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
significantly O 0

Moreover, O 0
transcriptomics O 0

showed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
differentially O 0
expressed O 0
genes O 0
between O 0
the O 0

and O 0
wild-type O 0
were O 0
mainly O 0
associated O 0
with O 0

Conclusion: O 0
The O 0

Drought O 0
stress O 0
is O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0
environmental O 0
factor O 0
that O 0
limits O 0
plant O 0
growth, O 0
development, O 0
and O 0
productivity. O 0

Autophagy O 0
of O 0
misfolded O 0
proteins O 0
can O 0
help O 0
alleviate O 0
the O 0
damage O 0
caused O 0
in O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
autophagy-mediated O 0
drought O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
plants O 0
remains O 0
largely O 0
unknown. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
cloned O 0
the O 0
gene O 0
for O 0
a O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

GENE O 0

(ZmNBR1), O 0
and O 0
identified O 0
its O 0
role O 0
in O 0
the O 0
response O 0
to O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

We O 0
observed O 0
that O 0
drought O 0
stress O 0
increased O 0
the O 0
accumulation O 0
of O 0
autophagosomes. O 0

RNA O 0
sequencing O 0
and O 0
reverse O 0
transcription-quantitative O 0
polymerase O 0
chain O 0
reaction O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
ZmNBR1 O 0
is O 0
markedly O 0
induced O 0
by O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

ZmNBR1 O 0
overexpression O 0
enhanced O 0
drought O 1
tolerance, O 1
while O 0
its O 0
knockdown O 0
reduced O 0
drought O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize. O 0

Our O 0
results O 0
established O 0
that O 0
ZmNBR1 O 0
mediates O 0
the O 0
increase O 0
in O 0
autophagosomes O 0
and O 0
autophagic O 0
activity O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

ZmNBR1 O 0
also O 0
affects O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
genes O 0
related O 0
to O 0
autophagy O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
determined O 0
that O 0
BRASSINOSTEROID O 0
INSENSITIVE O 0
1A O 0
(ZmBRI1a), O 0
a O 0
brassinosteroid O 0
receptor O 0
of O 0
the O 0
BRI1-like O 0
family, O 0
interacts O 0
with O 0
ZmNBR1. O 0

Phenotype O 0
analysis O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
ZmBRI1a O 0
negatively O 0
regulates O 0
drought O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize, O 0
and O 0
genetic O 0
analysis O 0
indicated O 0
that O 0
ZmNBR1 O 0
acts O 0
upstream O 0
of O 0
ZmBRI1a O 0
in O 0
regulating O 0
drought O 1
tolerance. O 1

Furthermore, O 0
ZmNBR1 O 0
facilitates O 0
the O 0
autophagic O 0
degradation O 0
of O 0
ZmBRI1a O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
stress. O 0

Taken O 0
together, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
reveal O 0
that O 0
ZmNBR1 O 0
regulates O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
autophagy-related O 0
genes, O 0
thereby O 0
increasing O 0
autophagic O 0
activity O 0
and O 0
promoting O 0
the O 0
autophagic O 0
degradation O 0
of O 0
ZmBRI1a O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
stress, O 0
thus O 0
enhancing O 0
drought O 1

in O 1

These O 0

Here, O 0
a O 0

two O 0
PCFTs, O 0
ZmMFS-1-62 O 0

The O 0

that O 0

We O 0
show O 0
that O 0

occurs O 0
at O 0
all O 0

Maize O 0
(Zea O 0
mays) O 0
is O 0
highly O 0
susceptible O 0
to O 0
waterlogging O 0
stress, O 0
which O 0
reduces O 0
both O 0
the O 0
yield O 1
and O 0
quality O 0
of O 0
this O 0
important O 0
crop. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
mechanism O 0
governing O 0
waterlogging O 0
tolerance O 0
is O 0
poorly O 0
understood. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
identify O 0
a O 0
waterlogging- O 0
and O 0
ethylene-inducible O 0
gene O 0
ZmEREB179 O 0
that O 0
encodes O 0
an O 0
ethylene O 1

factor O 0
(ERF) O 0
localized O 0
in O 0
the O 0
nucleus. O 0

Overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmEREB179 O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
increases O 0
the O 0
sensitivity O 0
to O 0

Conversely, O 0
the O 0
zmereb179 O 0
knockout O 0

are O 0
more O 0
tolerant O 0
to O 0
waterlogging, O 0
suggesting O 0
that O 0
ZmEREB179 O 0
functions O 0
as O 0
a O 0
negative O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
waterlogging O 0

A O 0
transcriptome O 0
analysis O 0
of O 0
the O 0

reveals O 0
that O 0
the O 0

modulates O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
various O 0
stress-related O 0

including O 0
ZmEREB180. O 0

We O 0
find O 0
that O 0
ZmEREB179 O 0
directly O 0
targets O 0
the O 0
ZmEREB180 O 0
promoter O 0
and O 0
represses O 0
its O 0

Notably, O 0
the O 0

of O 0
a O 0

that O 0

the O 0
ZmEREB179 O 0

(Hap2) O 0
are O 0
significantly O 0

The O 0

In O 0
this O 0

a O 0

Electrical O 0

provides O 0
an O 0

by O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
two-dimensional O 0
(2D) O 0
EIT O 0

the O 0

Therefore, O 0
an O 0
effective O 0
method O 0
for O 0

is O 0
necessary. O 0

In O 0

These O 0

To O 0

This O 0

thereby O 0
enhancing O 0

Subsequently, O 0

Our O 0

Zm00001d048138 O 0
were O 0
identified O 0
by O 0

As O 0
a O 0

is O 0
an O 0

trait O 0
that O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0

Herein, O 0
a O 0

in O 0
an O 0

Among O 0
these, O 0
three O 0

Of O 0
these O 0

Finally, O 0
173 O 0

In O 0

however, O 0
their O 0

remain O 0
largely O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
used O 0
two O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
a O 0

circRNAs O 0
expressed O 0
at O 0
significantly O 0
higher O 0

Enhanced O 0
expression O 0

was O 0
associated O 0
with O 0

found O 0
at O 0
the O 0
back-splicing O 0

as O 0
decreased O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0

are O 0
subject O 0
to O 0

The O 0
significant O 0

implying O 0
that O 0
circRNAs O 0
play O 0

in O 0
plant O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0

Result: O 0
In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
CgEC124 O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0

which O 0
belongs O 0
to O 0
glycoside O 0
hydrolase O 0
128 O 0
family. O 0

The O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
CgEC124 O 0
was O 0
significantly O 0
induced O 0
in O 0

especially O 0
at O 0
12 O 0

Furthermore, O 0
CgEC124 O 0
positively O 0
regulated O 0
the O 0
pathogenicity, O 0
but O 0
it O 0
did O 0
not O 0
impact O 0
the O 0

Ecotopic O 0

of O 0
CgEC124 O 0
decreased O 0
the O 0

Moreover, O 0
CgEC124 O 0
exhibited O 0
the O 0

and O 0
suppresses O 0

Conclusions: O 0
Our O 0
results O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
CgEC124 O 0
is O 0
required O 0
for O 0
full O 0

graminicola O 0
but O 0
not O 0
for O 0

In O 0

The O 0
ASP O 0
facilitates O 0
the O 0

To O 0
obtain O 0

we O 0

These O 0

enabled O 0
the O 0

which O 0
were O 0
designated O 0

respectively. O 0

ASP1 O 0
and O 0
ASP2, O 0
when O 0
linked O 0

ZM-AA1ΔSP, O 0
exhibited O 0
the O 0
capability O 0
to O 0
disrupt O 0

whereas O 0
ASP3 O 0
and O 0
ASP4 O 0
did O 0
not O 0
produce O 0
this O 0

Interestingly, O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

In O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
a O 0

maize O 0
(ZmASR1) O 0
and O 0
functionally O 0
characterized O 0
its O 0

The O 0

was O 0
upregulated O 0
under O 0

Moreover, O 0

the O 0

Maize O 0

However, O 0
recognizing O 0
these O 0

three O 0
key O 0
improvements O 0
relative O 0

existing O 0
essential O 0
blocks. O 0

First, O 0
it O 0
improves O 0
the O 0

the O 0
change O 0

and O 0
reduces O 0
the O 0

at O 0
the O 0

The O 0
second O 0
improvement O 0
is O 0
that O 0
it O 0
replaces O 0
a O 0

The O 0
third O 0
improvement O 0
is O 0
that O 0
it O 0
replaces O 0
different O 0

kernels O 0
to O 0

Drought, O 0

on O 0

PHDs O 0
were O 0
identified O 0
as O 0
stress-responsive O 0
genes O 0
in O 0
a O 0

range O 0
of O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

governing O 0
PHD O 0

in O 0

are O 0
still O 0
largely O 0

and O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
a O 0

resulting O 0
in O 0

ZmVIL2 O 0
belongs O 0
to O 0

Compared O 0
to O 0
WT, O 0
zmvil2 O 0
mutant O 0
exhibited O 0
increased O 0

Consistently, O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
ZmVIL2 O 0
enhances O 0

in O 1
maize. O 0

Y2H, O 0
BiFC, O 0
and O 0
Co-IP O 0
experiments O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
ZmVIL2 O 0
directly O 0

zmfip37 O 0

also O 0
exhibit O 0
decreased O 0

Interestingly, O 0
we O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
ZmABF4 O 0
directly O 0

Therefore, O 0
we O 0
uncovered O 0
a O 0

ZmABF4-ZmVIL2/ZmFIP37 O 0
that O 0
promotes O 0

After O 0

Some O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0
ZmCPK2 O 0
does O 0
not O 0

Interestingly, O 0
ZmCPK2 O 0

which O 0
is O 0

Our O 0

The O 0

firstly, O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

Despite O 0

There O 0
has O 0
been O 0
minimal O 0

Also, O 0
maize O 0

about O 0
the O 0

In O 0

strongly O 0
inhibited O 0
upon O 0

while O 0
overexpression O 0

significantly O 0
promoted O 0
mesocotyl O 0

indicating O 0
that O 0
ZmSRO1e O 0
positively O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
two O 0

in O 0
the O 0

Furthermore, O 0
by O 0

we O 0
observe O 0
that O 0
the O 0

affects O 0
both O 0

The O 0

indicate O 0
that O 0
the O 0

of O 0
these O 0
two O 0

are O 0
more O 0

(CAT) O 0
were O 0
elevated, O 0
which O 0
effectively O 0
enhanced O 0
the O 0

and O 0
facilitated O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
malondialdehyde O 0

increased O 0
consistently, O 0
which O 0
would O 0

for O 0
the O 0

which O 0
IAA O 0
first O 0

Despite O 0

even O 0
though O 0
they O 0
have O 0

We O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0

A O 0

adopted O 0
to O 0
quantify O 0
the O 0

Based O 0
on O 0

we O 0
considered O 0

In O 0

Both O 0

We O 0

confirmed O 0
that O 0

Moreover, O 0
we O 0
found O 0

We O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

involved O 0
in O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

a O 0

in O 0

B. O 0

maydis, O 0
named O 0
zma-miR169s, O 0
was O 0
discovered O 0

investigated. O 0

The O 0

and O 0
zma-miR169s O 0
were O 0
significantly O 0

CRISPR/Cas9-induced O 0
zma-miR169s O 0

exhibited O 0
more O 0

whereas O 0
overexpression O 0
zma-miR169s O 0
enhanced O 0

supporting O 0
that O 0
zma-miR169s O 0
might O 0
play O 0
a O 0
negative O 0
role O 0
in O 0
maize O 0

Moreover, O 0
RNA-seq O 0
and O 0

showed O 0
that O 0

were O 0
highly O 0
enriched O 0
in O 0
the O 0
oxidation-reduction O 0

Hence, O 0
reactive O 0
oxygen O 0

(ROS) O 0
and O 0
plant O 0

levels O 0
were O 0
further O 0

ROS O 0
detection O 0
confirmed O 0
that O 0
zma-miR169s O 0

while O 0

In O 0

the O 0

in O 0

that O 0
exposure O 0
to O 0

(100 O 0

resulted O 0
in O 0
the O 0

in O 0
endogenous O 0

in O 0
maize O 0

respectively. O 0

Similarly, O 0
the O 0
endogenous O 0
melatonin O 0
system O 0
is O 0
activated O 0
in O 0
response O 0
to O 0

We O 0
found O 0
that O 0

had O 0
a O 0
significant O 0
impact O 0
on O 0
the O 0
relative O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
LCD/DCD, O 0
leading O 0
to O 0
a O 0
103.3% O 0
and O 0
116.7% O 0
increase O 0
in O 0
endogenous O 0
H2S O 0

in O 0
maize O 0

respectively. O 0

In O 0
contrast, O 0
NaHS O 0
had O 0
minimal O 0

on O 0
the O 0

of O 0

The O 0
production O 0
of O 0
H2S O 0
induced O 0
by O 0
melatonin O 0
is O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
an O 0
increase O 0
in O 0

as O 0
evidenced O 0
by O 0

increased O 0

and O 0
improved O 0

The O 0
scavenging O 0
of O 0
H2S O 0
decreases O 0
the O 0
melatonin-induced O 0

while O 0
the O 0

p-chlorophenylalanine O 0
(p-CPA), O 0
has O 0
minimal O 0

In O 0
conclusion, O 0
our O 0

in O 0
the O 0

faces O 0
severe O 0
challenges O 0
from O 0
various O 0

The O 0
timely O 0
and O 0
accurate O 0
identification O 0
of O 0
maize O 0

for O 0
ensuring O 0
agricultural O 0

Currently, O 0
the O 0
identification O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
leaf O 0
diseases O 0
and O 0
pests O 0
faces O 0
two O 0
key O 0
challenges: O 0
(1) O 0
In O 0
the O 0
actual O 0
process O 0
of O 0
identifying O 0
leaf O 0
diseases O 0
and O 0
pests, O 0
complex O 0
backgrounds O 0
can O 0
interfere O 0
with O 0
the O 0
identification O 0
effect. O 0

(2) O 0
The O 0
subtle O 0
features O 0
of O 0
diseases O 0
and O 0
pests O 0
are O 0
difficult O 0
to O 0
accurately O 0
extract. O 0

To O 0
address O 0
these O 0
challenges, O 0
this O 0
study O 0
proposes O 0
a O 0
maize O 0
leaf O 0
disease O 0
and O 0
pest O 0
identification O 0
model O 0
called O 0
LFMNet. O 0

Firstly, O 0
the O 0
localized O 0
multi-scale O 0
inverted O 0
residual O 0
convolutional O 0
block O 0
(LMSB) O 0
is O 0
proposed O 0
to O 0
perform O 0
preliminary O 0
down-sampling O 0
on O 0
the O 0

preserving O 0
important O 0
feature O 0
information O 0
for O 0
the O 0
subsequent O 0
extraction O 0
of O 0
fine O 0
disease O 0
and O 0
pest O 0
features O 0
in O 0
the O 0
model O 0
structure. O 0

Then, O 0
the O 0
feature O 0
localization O 0
bottleneck O 0
(FLB) O 0
is O 0
proposed O 0
to O 0
improve O 0
the O 0
model's O 0
ability O 0
to O 0
focus O 0
on O 0
and O 0
locate O 0
disease O 0
and O 0
pest O 0
characteristics O 0
and O 0
to O 0
reduce O 0
interference O 0
from O 0
complex O 0
backgrounds. O 0

Subsequently, O 0
the O 0
multi-hop O 0
local-feature O 0
fusion O 0
architecture O 0
(MLFFA) O 0
is O 0
proposed, O 0
which O 0
effectively O 0
addresses O 0
the O 0
problem O 0
of O 0
extracting O 0
subtle O 0
features O 0
by O 0
enhancing O 0
the O 0
extraction O 0
and O 0
fusion O 0
of O 0
global O 0
and O 0
local O 0
disease O 0
and O 0
pest O 0
features O 0
in O 0
images. O 0

After O 0
training O 0
and O 0
testing O 0
on O 0
a O 0
dataset O 0
containing O 0
19,451 O 0
images O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
leaf O 0
diseases O 0
and O 0
pests, O 0
the O 0
LFMNet O 0
model O 0
demonstrated O 0
excellent O 0
performance, O 0
with O 0
an O 0
average O 0
identification O 0
accuracy O 0
of O 0
95.68%, O 0
a O 0

of O 0
95.91%, O 0
a O 0

of O 0
95.78%, O 0
and O 0
an O 0

of O 0
95.83%. O 0

Compared O 0
to O 0

it O 0
exhibits O 0
significant O 0
advantages, O 0

The O 0

Evidently, O 0
both O 0

In O 0
conclusion, O 0

Therefore, O 0

Indeed, O 0
the O 0

is O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0
challenge O 0
in O 0
crop O 0

This O 0
study O 0
focuses O 0
on O 0
the O 0
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate O 0
dioxygenase O 0
Inhibitor O 0
Sensitive O 0
1-Like O 0

and O 0
exhibiting O 0
weak O 0
catalytic O 0
activity O 0
against O 0
many O 0
β-triketone O 0

(β-THs). O 0

The O 0
crystal O 0
structures O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
HSL1A O 0
complexed O 0
with O 0
β-THs O 0
were O 0
elucidated, O 0
identifying O 0
four O 0

and O 0
explaining O 0
the O 0
weak O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
HSL1A O 0
against O 0
the O 0
herbicides. O 0

Utilizing O 0
an O 0
artificial O 0
evolution O 0
approach, O 0
we O 0
developed O 0
a O 0
series O 0
of O 0
rice O 0
HSL1 O 0
mutants O 0
targeting O 0
the O 0
four O 0
residues. O 0

Then, O 0
these O 0
mutants O 0
were O 0
systematically O 0
evaluated, O 0
identifying O 0
the O 0
M10 O 0
variant O 0
as O 0
the O 0
most O 0
effective O 0
in O 0
modifying O 0
β-THs. O 0

The O 0

substrate O 0
binding O 0
in O 0
HSL1 O 0
was O 0
also O 0
revealed O 0
from O 0
these O 0
mutants. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
M10 O 0
in O 0
rice O 0
significantly O 0
enhanced O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
β-THs, O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0
a O 0
notable O 0
32-fold O 0

In O 0
conclusion, O 0
the O 0

Significance: O 0
The O 0
discovery O 0
and O 0

of O 0
herbicide-resistant O 0
genes O 0
represent O 0
a O 0
critical O 0
frontier O 0
in O 0
modern O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
focused O 0
on O 0
unraveling O 0
the O 0
intricate O 0
mechanisms O 0
underlying O 0
herbicide O 0
resistance, O 0
particularly O 0
within O 0
the O 0
prevalent O 0
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate O 0
dioxygenase O 0
Inhibitor O 0
Sensitive O 0
1-Like O 0

The O 0
structures O 0
of O 0
HSLs O 0
complexed O 0
with O 0
different O 0
herbicides O 0
not O 0
only O 0
revealed O 0
the O 0
initial O 0
binding O 0
mode O 0
of O 0
substrate O 0
in O 0
HSLs, O 0
but O 0
also O 0
explained O 0
the O 0
catalytic O 0
selectivity O 0
of O 0
some O 0
HSL O 0
members. O 0

From O 0
these O 0
structures, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
four O 0
residues O 0
critical O 0
for O 0
catalysis. O 0

Leveraging O 0
an O 0
artificial O 0
evolution O 0
approach, O 0
these O 0
residues O 0
were O 0
mutated O 0
which O 0
significantly O 0
enhanced O 0
the O 0
resistance O 0
to O 0
β-triketone O 0
herbicides O 0
in O 0
rice. O 0

Our O 0
findings O 0
not O 0
only O 0
shed O 0
light O 0
on O 0
the O 0
catalytic O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
HSLs O 0
against O 0
herbicides O 0

also O 0
provide O 0
a O 0

Background: O 0
In O 0
a O 0
screening O 0
of O 0

anisiflupurin O 0
was O 0
identified O 0
as O 0
potent O 0
inhibitor O 0

The O 0
aim O 0
of O 0
the O 0
study O 0
was O 0
to O 0
profile O 0
anisiflupurin O 0
in O 0
a O 0

Results: O 0
Anisiflupurin O 0

Similarly, O 0
the O 0

Thereby, O 0

or O 0

This O 0
review O 0
thus O 0
aims O 0
to O 0
understand O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0
mechanisms O 0
controlling O 0
mitochondrial-nuclear O 0

The O 0
enzyme O 0
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate O 0
synthase O 0
(EPSPS) O 0
functions O 0
in O 0
the O 0
shikimate O 0
pathway O 0
which O 0
is O 0
responsible O 0
for O 0
the O 0
production O 0
of O 0
aromatic O 0
amino O 0
acids O 0
and O 0
precursors O 0
of O 0
other O 0
essential O 0
secondary O 0
metabolites O 0
in O 0
all O 0
plant O 0
species. O 0

EPSPS O 0
is O 0
also O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
target O 0
of O 0
the O 0
herbicide O 0
glyphosate. O 0

While O 0
some O 0
plant O 0
EPSPS O 0
variants O 0
have O 0
been O 0
characterized O 0
with O 0
reduced O 0
glyphosate O 1
sensitivity O 1
and O 1
have O 0
been O 0
used O 0
in O 0
biotechnology, O 0
the O 0
glyphosate O 1
insensitivity O 1
typically O 0
comes O 0
with O 0
a O 0
cost O 0
to O 0
catalytic O 0
efficiency. O 0

Thus, O 0
there O 0
exists O 0
a O 0
need O 0
to O 0
generate O 0
additional O 0
EPSPS O 0
variants O 0
that O 0
maintain O 0
both O 0
high O 0
catalytic O 0
efficiency O 0
and O 0
high O 0
glyphosate O 1
tolerance. O 1

Here, O 0
we O 0
create O 0
a O 0
synthetic O 0
yeast O 0
system O 0
to O 0
rapidly O 0
study O 0
and O 0
evolve O 0
heterologous O 0
EPSP O 0
synthases O 0
for O 0
these O 0
dual O 0
traits. O 0

Using O 0
known O 0
EPSPS O 0
variants, O 0
we O 0
first O 0
validate O 0
that O 0
our O 0
synthetic O 0
yeast O 0
system O 0
is O 0
capable O 0
of O 0
recapitulating O 0
growth O 0
characteristics O 0
observed O 0
in O 0
plants O 0
grown O 0
in O 0
varying O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
glyphosate. O 0

Next, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
variants O 0
from O 0
mutagenesis O 0
libraries O 0
with O 0
distinct O 0
phenotypic O 0
traits O 0
can O 0
be O 0
isolated O 0
depending O 0
on O 0
the O 0
selection O 0
criteria O 0
applied. O 0

By O 0
applying O 0
strong O 0
dual-trait O 0
selection O 0
pressure, O 0
we O 0
identify O 0
a O 0
notable O 0
EPSPS O 0
mutant O 0
after O 0
just O 0
a O 0
single O 0
round O 0
of O 0
evolution O 0
that O 0
displays O 0
robust O 0
glyphosate O 1
tolerance O 1
(Ki O 1
of O 0
nearly O 0
1 O 0
mM) O 0
and O 0
improved O 0
enzymatic O 0
efficiency O 0
over O 0
the O 0
starting O 0
point O 0
(~2.5 O 0
fold). O 0

Finally, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
the O 0
crystal O 0
structure O 0
of O 0
corn O 0
EPSPS O 0
and O 0
the O 0
top O 0
resulting O 0
mutants O 0
and O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
certain O 0
mutants O 0
have O 0
the O 0
potential O 0
to O 0
outperform O 0
previously O 0
reported O 0
glyphosate-resistant O 0
EPSPS O 0
mutants, O 0
such O 0
as O 0
T102I O 0
and O 0
P106S O 0
(denoted O 0
as O 0
TIPS), O 0
in O 0
whole-plant O 0
testing. O 0

Altogether, O 0
this O 0
platform O 0
helps O 0
explore O 0
the O 0
trade-off O 0
between O 0
glyphosate O 0
resistance O 0
and O 0
enzymatic O 0
efficiency. O 0

Significance: O 0
Glyphosate O 0
is O 0
a O 0
herbicide O 0
that O 0
selectively O 0
inhibits O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate O 0
synthase O 0
(EPSPS) O 0
of O 0
the O 0
plant O 0
shikimate O 0
pathway. O 0

Mutations O 0
within O 0
EPSPS O 0
enable O 0
glyphosate O 0
resistance O 0
and O 0
thus O 0
protective O 0
capacity O 0
to O 0
modified O 0
crops. O 0

However, O 0
these O 0
mutations O 0
decrease O 0
basal O 0
enzymatic O 0
efficiency O 0
and O 0
can O 0
hinder O 0
plant O 0
growth. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
work, O 0
we O 0
develop O 0
a O 0
synthetic O 0
yeast O 0
selection O 0
system O 0
that O 0
closely O 0
simulates O 0
growth O 0
trends O 0
seen O 0
in O 0
plants O 0
and O 0
utilize O 0
a O 0
dual-trait O 0

strategy O 0
to O 0
enable O 0
the O 0
rapid O 0
evolution O 0
of O 0
novel O 0
EPSPS O 0
variants O 0
that O 0
confer O 0
both O 0
improved O 0
enzyme O 0
properties O 0
and O 0
glyphosate O 0
resistance. O 0

Transfection O 0
into O 0
plants O 0
validates O 0
this O 0
dual O 0
phenotype O 0
and O 0
demonstrates O 0
a O 0
superior O 0

Asian O 0

plants. O 0

During O 0
their O 0
co-evolution O 0
with O 0
herbivorous O 0
insects, O 0
plants O 0
have O 0
developed O 0
multiple O 0

that O 0

such O 0
as O 0
releasing O 0
a O 0

(HIPVs) O 0
that O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

in O 0

are O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
the O 0
Asian O 0

(ACB, O 0
Ostrinia O 0

a O 0
major O 0

shows O 0
a O 0
preference O 0
for O 0
maize O 0
pre-infested O 0
with O 0
ACB O 0

rather O 0
than O 0
being O 0
repelled O 0
by O 0

Through O 0

and O 0

analysis O 0
of O 0
ACB-infested O 0
maize O 0
seedlings, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
two O 0
substances O 0
that O 0
explain O 0
this O 0
behavior: O 0
(E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene O 0
(DMNT) O 0
and O 0
(3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene O 0
(TMTT). O 0

DMNT O 0
and O 0
TMTT O 0
attracted O 0
ACB O 0

and O 0
knocking O 0
out O 0
the O 0

for O 0
their O 0

impaired O 0
this O 0

DMNT/TMTT O 0
hampered O 0
the O 0

ability O 0
to O 0

These O 0
findings O 0
uncover O 0
a O 0

for O 0

Background: O 0
Drought O 0
is O 0
the O 0
most O 0

factor O 0
limiting O 0
maize O 0

given O 0
that O 0

However, O 0

with O 0
an O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
P7-1 O 0
can O 0
recruit O 0
another O 0
maize O 0
protein, O 0
gibberellin O 0
2-oxidase O 0

(ZmGA2ox7.3), O 0
which O 0
also O 0
exhibits O 0
tighter O 0

The O 0
oligomerization O 0
of O 0
ZmGA2ox7.3 O 0
is O 0
vital O 0
for O 0
its O 0
function O 0
in O 0
converting O 0
bioactive O 0

Moreover, O 0
the O 0
enzymatic O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
ZmGA2ox7.3 O 0
oligomers O 0
increases O 0
when O 0
forming O 0
hetero-oligomers O 0
with O 0
P7-1/ZmGDIα, O 0
but O 0
decreases O 0
when O 0
ZmGDIα-hel O 0
replaces O 0
ZmGDIα. O 0

Viral O 0
infection O 0
significantly O 0
promotes O 0
ZmGA2ox7.3 O 0
expression O 0
and O 0
oligomerization O 0
in O 0
ZmGDIα-containing O 0
susceptible O 0
maize, O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0

This O 0
causes O 0
an O 0
auxin/cytokinin O 0

and O 0
ultimately O 0
manifests O 0
as O 0

Conversely, O 0
in O 0

counters O 0
these O 0

The O 0
introduction O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
genetic O 0
transformation O 1
in O 1
the O 0
1990s O 0
brought O 0
forth O 0
a O 0
powerful O 0
tool O 0
for O 0
crop O 0
improvement O 0
and O 0
a O 0
deeper O 0
understanding O 0
of O 0

Despite O 0
decades O 0
of O 0
genetics O 0
research, O 0
however, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
promise O 0
of O 0
CRISPR-mediated O 0

maize O 0

currently O 0
faces O 0
several O 0
challenges, O 0
such O 0
as O 0
genotype O 0

and O 0
limitations O 0
in O 0
explant O 0

Indeed, O 0
although O 0
the O 0
most O 0
commonly O 0
used O 0
method, O 0

has O 0

is O 1
a O 0
critical O 0
tool O 0
for O 0
functional O 0

Many O 0

however, O 0
continue O 0

face O 0
multiple O 0

in O 0
attempting O 0
to O 0
achieve O 0
routine O 0
genetic O 0

Here, O 0

transformation O 1
method O 0
using O 0
immature O 0

This O 0
method O 0
uses O 0
an O 0
Agrobacterium O 0

which O 0
includes O 0
a O 0

Conventional O 0
maize O 0
transformation O 1
has O 0
largely O 0
relied O 0
on O 0
immature O 0
embryos O 0
as O 0
explants, O 0
and O 0
is O 0
thus O 0
often O 0
hampered O 0
by O 0
the O 0
limited O 0
access O 0
to O 0
high-quality O 0
immature O 0

year-round. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
present O 0
a O 0
detailed O 0
protocol O 0
using O 0
seedling O 0
leaf O 0
whorls O 0
as O 0
alternative O 0
explants O 0
for O 0
tropical O 0
maize O 0

transformation. O 0

This O 0
approach O 0
involves O 0
the O 0
use O 0
of O 0
a O 0

that O 0

which O 0
have O 0
been O 0
shown O 0
to O 0
greatly O 0

We O 0
outline O 0
here O 0
the O 0
steps O 0
required O 0
for O 0
the O 0

describe O 0
the O 0

that O 0
results O 0
in O 0

Because O 0
constitutive O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
Bbm O 0
and O 0
Wus2 O 0
prevents O 0
normal O 0
plant O 0
regeneration O 0
and O 0
the O 0
production O 0
of O 0
fertile O 0
plants, O 0
the O 0
cassette O 0
containing O 0
these O 0
genes O 0
must O 0
be O 0
excised. O 0

As O 0
such, O 0
we O 0
include O 0
the O 0
steps O 0
for O 0
the O 0
Cre/loxP-mediated O 0
excision O 0
of O 0

and O 0
determine O 0
the O 0

Maize O 0

has O 0
achieved O 0
the O 0

to O 0
at O 0

eight O 0

in O 0
modern O 0
maize. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0
mechanisms O 0
underlying O 0
this O 0

remain O 0
unclear. O 0

To O 0
understand O 0

we O 0
developed O 0

introgressing O 0

which O 0
is O 0
fewer O 0
than O 0
those O 0
in O 0
almost O 0
all O 0

We O 0
detected O 0
two O 0

and O 0
fine-mapped O 0
the O 0

Two O 0

were O 0
identified O 0
from O 0

and O 0

Finally, O 0
we O 0
proposed O 0
that O 0

Consistently, O 0
the O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
ten O 0

Five O 0

However, O 0
no O 0

Furthermore, O 0
ZmCYP90D1 O 0

Additionally, O 0
we O 0

In O 0
particular, O 0
CO2 O 0

dramatically O 0

at O 0

CO2 O 0

is O 0
accomplished O 0
by O 0

by O 0
the O 0

However, O 0

however, O 0
the O 0

We O 0
also O 0
examine O 0
whether O 0
the O 0
heat-mediated O 0

RCA O 0
is O 0
due O 0
to O 0

We O 0
reveal O 0
that O 0

affects O 0

differently O 0

Introduction: O 0
Melatonin, O 0
a O 0
tryptophan-derived O 0
indoleamine O 0
metabolite O 0
with O 0
important O 0
roles O 0
in O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0
and O 0
defense, O 0
has O 0
recently O 0
been O 0
regarded O 0
as O 0
a O 0
new O 0
plant O 0
hormone. O 0

Maize O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
important O 0
cereal O 0
crops O 0
in O 0
the O 0
world. O 0

Although O 0
the O 0
melatonin O 0
receptor O 0
gene, O 0
ZmPMTR1, O 0
has O 0
already O 0
been O 0
identified, O 0
the O 0
genetic O 0
basis O 0
of O 0
melatonin O 0
biosynthesis O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
has O 0
still O 0
not O 0
been O 0
elucidated. O 0

Serotonin O 0
N-acetyltransferase O 0
(SNAT) O 0
is O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
that O 0
converts O 0
serotonin O 0
to O 0
N-acetylserotonin O 0
(NAS) O 0
or O 0
5-methoxytryptamine O 0
(5MT) O 0
to O 0
melatonin O 0
in O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
and O 0
rice, O 0
but O 0
no O 0
SNAT O 0
encoding O 0
gene O 0
has O 0
been O 0
identified O 0
yet O 0
in O 0
maize. O 0

Methods: O 0
The O 0
bioinformatics O 0
analysis O 0
was O 0
used O 0
to O 0
identify O 0
maize O 0
SNAT O 0
genes O 0
and O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
the O 0
recombinant O 0
proteins O 0
was O 0
determined O 0
through O 0
in O 0
vitro O 0
assay. O 0

The O 0
expression O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
ZmSNAT1 O 0
and O 0
ZmSNAT3 O 0
under O 0
drought O 0
and O 0
heat O 0
stresses O 0
were O 0
revealed O 0
by O 0
public O 0
RNA-seq O 0
datasets O 0
and O 0
qRT-PCR O 0
analysis. O 0

Results: O 0
We O 0
first O 0
identified O 0
three O 0
maize O 0
SNAT O 0
genes, O 0
ZmSNAT1, O 0
ZmSNAT2, O 0
and O 0
ZmSNAT3, O 0
through O 0
bioinformatics O 0
analysis, O 0
and O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
ZmSNAT2 O 0
was O 0
present O 0
in O 0
only O 0
eight O 0
of O 0
the O 0
26 O 0
cultivars O 0
analyzed. O 0

We O 0
then O 0
determined O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
ZmSNAT1 O 0
and O 0
ZmSNAT3 O 0
using O 0
their O 0
recombinant O 0
proteins O 0
through O 0
in O 0
vitro O 0
assay. O 0

The O 0
results O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
both O 0
ZmSNAT1 O 0
and O 0
ZmSNAT3 O 0
could O 0
convert O 0
serotonin O 0
to O 0
NAS O 0
and O 0
5-MT O 0
to O 0
melatonin. O 0

Recombinant O 0
ZmSNAT1 O 0
catalyzed O 0
serotonin O 0
into O 0
NAS O 0
with O 0
a O 0
higher O 0
catalytic O 0
activity O 0
(K O 0
m, O 0
8.6 O 0
mM; O 0
V O 0
max, O 0
4050 O 0
pmol/min/mg O 0
protein) O 0
than O 0
ZmSNAT3 O 0
(K O 0
m, O 0
11.51 O 0
mM; O 0
V O 0
max, O 0
142 O 0
pmol/min/mg O 0
protein). O 0

We O 0
further O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
the O 0
228th O 0
amino O 0
acid O 0
Tyr O 0
(Y228) O 0
was O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
the O 0
enzymatic O 0
activity O 0
of O 0
ZmSNAT1. O 0

Finally, O 0
we O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
ZmSNAT1 O 0
and O 0
ZmSNAT3 O 0
varied O 0
among O 0
different O 0
maize O 0
cultivars O 0
and O 0
different O 0
tissues O 0
of O 0
a O 0
plant, O 0
and O 0
was O 0
responsive O 0
to O 0
drought O 0
and O 0
heat O 0
stresses. O 0

Discussion: O 0
In O 0
summary, O 0
the O 0
present O 0
study O 0
identified O 0
and O 0
characterized O 0
the O 0
first O 0
two O 0
functional O 0
SNAT O 0
genes O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
laying O 0
the O 0
foundation O 0
for O 0
further O 0
research O 0
on O 0
melatonin O 0
biosynthesis O 0
and O 0
its O 0
regulatory O 0
role O 0
in O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0

Catechol O 0
acetylglucose: O 0
A O 0
newly O 0
identified O 0
benzoxazinoid-regulated O 0
defensive O 0
metabolite O 0
in O 0
maize O 0

An O 0
enormous O 0
diversity O 0
of O 0
specialized O 0
metabolites O 0
is O 0
produced O 0
in O 0
the O 0
plant O 0
kingdom, O 0
with O 0
each O 0
individual O 0
plant O 0
synthesizing O 0
thousands O 0
of O 0
these O 0
compounds. O 0

Previous O 0
research O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
benzoxazinoids, O 0
the O 0
most O 0
abundant O 0
class O 0
of O 0
specialized O 0
metabolites O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
also O 0
function O 0
as O 0
signaling O 0
molecules O 0
by O 0
regulating O 0
the O 0
production O 0
callose O 0
as O 0
a O 0
defense O 0
response. O 0

We O 0
searched O 0
for O 0
additional O 0
benzoxazinoid-regulated O 0
specialized O 0
metabolites, O 0
characterized O 0
them, O 0
examined O 0
whether O 0
they O 0
too O 0
function O 0
in O 0
herbivore O 0
protection, O 0
and O 0
determined O 0
how O 0
Spodoptera O 0
frugiperda O 0
(fall O 0
armyworm), O 0
a O 0
prominent O 0
maize O 0
pest, O 0
copes O 0
with O 0
these O 0
metabolites. O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
catechol O 0
acetylglucose O 0
(CAG) O 0
as O 0
a O 0
benzoxazinoid-regulated O 0
metabolite O 0
that O 0
is O 0
produced O 0
from O 0
salicylic O 0
acid O 0
via O 0
catechol O 0
and O 0
catechol O 0
glucoside. O 0

Genome-wide O 0
association O 0
studies O 0
of O 0
CAG O 0
abundance O 0
identified O 0
a O 0
gene O 0
encoding O 0
a O 0
predicted O 0
acetyltransferase. O 0

Knockout O 0
of O 0
this O 0
gene O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
plants O 0
that O 0
lack O 0
CAG O 0
and O 0
over-accumulate O 0
catechol O 0
glucoside. O 0

Upon O 0
tissue O 0
disruption, O 0
maize O 0
plants O 0
accumulate O 0
catechol, O 0
which O 0
inhibits O 0
S. O 0

frugiperda O 0
growth. O 0

Analysis O 0
of O 0
caterpillar O 0
frass O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
S. O 0

frugiperda O 0
detoxifies O 0
catechol O 0
by O 0
glycosylation, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
efficiency O 0
of O 0
catechol O 0
glycosylation O 0
was O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
S. O 0

frugiperda O 0
growth O 0
on O 0
a O 0
catechol-containing O 0
diet. O 0

Thus, O 0
the O 0
success O 0
of O 0
S. O 0

frugiperda O 0
as O 0
an O 0
agricultural O 0
pest O 0
may O 0
depend O 0
partly O 0
on O 0
its O 0
ability O 0
to O 0
detoxify O 0
catechol, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
produced O 0
as O 0
a O 0
defensive O 0
metabolite O 0
by O 0
maize. O 0

RNA-directed O 0
DNA O 0

in O 0
maize. O 0

The O 0
epigenetic O 0
process O 0
of O 0
RNA-directed O 0
DNA O 0
methylation O 0
(RdDM) O 0
regulates O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
genes O 0
and O 0
transposons. O 0

However, O 0
little O 0
is O 0
known O 0
about O 0
the O 0
involvement O 0
of O 0
RdDM O 0
in O 0
the O 0
response O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0
mays) O 0
to O 0
salt O 0
stress. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
isolated O 0
a O 0
salt-sensitive O 0
maize O 0
mutant O 0
and O 0
cloned O 0
the O 0
underlying O 0
gene, O 0
which O 0
encodes O 0
KOW O 0
DOMAIN-CONTAINING O 0
TRANSCRIPTION O 0
FACTOR1 O 0
(KTF1), O 0
an O 0
essential O 0
component O 0
of O 0
the O 0
RdDM O 0
pathway. O 0

Evolutionary O 0
analysis O 0
identified O 0
two O 0
homologs O 0
of O 0
KTF1 O 0
(ZmKTF1A O 0
and O 0
ZmKTF1B) O 0
with O 0
highly O 0
similar O 0
expression O 0
patterns. O 0

Whole-genome O 0
bisulfite O 0
sequencing O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0
mutations O 0
in O 0
ZmKTF1 O 0
substantially O 0
decrease O 0
genome-wide O 0
CHH O 0
(H O 0
= O 0
A, O 0
C, O 0
or O 0
T) O 0
methylation O 0
levels. O 0

Moreover, O 0
our O 0
findings O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
ZmKTF1-mediated O 0
DNA O 0
methylation O 0
regulates O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
multiple O 0
key O 0
genes O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
oxidoreductase O 0
activity O 0
upon O 0
exposure O 0
to O 0
salt, O 0
concomitant O 0
with O 0
increased O 0
levels O 0
of O 0
reactive O 0
oxygen O 0
species. O 0

In O 0
addition, O 0
insertion-deletion O 0
mutations O 0
(InDels) O 0
in O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
of O 0
ZmKTF1 O 0
affect O 0
its O 0
expression, O 0
thereby O 0
altering O 0
Na+ O 0
concentrations O 0
in O 0
seedlings O 0
in O 0
a O 0
natural O 0
maize O 0
population. O 0

Therefore, O 0
ZmKTF1 O 0
might O 0
represent O 0
an O 0
untapped O 0
epigenetic O 0
resource O 0
for O 0
improving O 0
salt O 1
tolerance O 1
in O 1
maize. O 0

Overall, O 0
our O 0
work O 0
demonstrates O 0
the O 0
critical O 0
role O 0
of O 0
ZmKTF1 O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
the O 0

Taken O 0

our O 0

that O 0

Dormancy O 0
is O 0
an O 0
essential O 0

that O 0

its O 0

primarily O 0

on O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
MyoB13 O 0
is O 0
highly O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
dry O 0
mature O 0

The O 0
myob13 O 0
mutant, O 0
created O 0
using O 0
CRISPR/Cas9, O 0
exhibits O 0
a O 0
preharvest O 0

phenotype, O 0
which O 0
can O 0
be O 0
mitigated O 0
by O 0
after-ripening O 0

indicating O 0
that O 0
MyoB13 O 0
plays O 0
a O 0
positive O 0
role O 0
in O 0
primary O 0
seed O 1
dormancy. O 1

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
MyoB13 O 0
negatively O 0
regulates O 0
ABA O 0
biosynthesis O 0
and O 0

pathways. O 0

Notably, O 0
the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
MyoB13 O 0
orthologs O 0
from O 0
maize O 0
and O 0

can O 0
completely O 0
restore O 0
the O 0
phenotype O 0
of O 0
the O 0
Arabidopsis O 0
myob13 O 0

suggesting O 0
that O 0
the O 0
function O 0
of O 0
MyoB13 O 0
in O 0
ABA-induced O 0
seed O 1

is O 0
evolutionarily O 0

Therefore, O 0
the O 0

One O 0
way O 0
to O 0
study O 0
the O 0
impact O 0
of O 0
hormones O 0
on O 0
these O 0
processes O 0
is O 0
by O 0
external O 0
application, O 0
followed O 0
by O 0
evaluation O 0
of O 0
parameters O 0
of O 0
interest. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
describe O 0
one O 0
such O 0
method O 0
for O 0
the O 0
exogenous O 0
application O 0
of O 0
hormones O 0
in O 0
maize: O 0
the O 0
apical O 0
whorl O 0
treatment O 0
approach, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
well O 0
suited O 0
for O 0
evaluating O 0
the O 0
role O 0
of O 0
these O 0
compounds O 0
in O 0
reproductive O 1
stages O 1
(e.g., O 0
when O 0
the O 0
target O 0
organ O 0
is O 0
the O 0
inflorescence O 0
meristem). O 0

This O 0
method O 0
involves O 0
direct O 0
application O 0
of O 0
a O 0
hormone O 0
solution O 0
to O 0
the O 0
apical O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0
plants O 0
every O 0
2 O 0
days O 0
until O 0
the O 0
tassel O 0
emerges, O 0
which O 0
takes O 0
15-20 O 0
days, O 0
or O 0
until O 0
the O 0
treated O 0
plants O 0
show O 0
noticeable O 0
phenotypic O 0
changes O 0
for O 0
evaluation. O 0

This O 0
method O 0
is O 0
ideal O 0
for O 0
observing O 0
effects O 0
on O 0
the O 0
apical O 0
meristem, O 0
and O 0
it O 0
may O 0
be O 0

Exogenous O 0
Application O 0
of O 0
Hormones O 0
in O 0
Maize. O 0

Exogenous O 0
application O 0
of O 0
hormones O 0
in O 0
plants O 0
is O 0
a O 0
valuable O 0
technique O 0
for O 0
studying O 0
and O 0
manipulating O 0
plant O 0
growth, O 0
development, O 0
and O 0
responses O 0
to O 0
environmental O 0
stimuli. O 0

The O 0
foliar O 0
spray O 0
method O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
common O 0
approaches O 0
for O 0
the O 0
exogenous O 0
application O 0
of O 0
hormones O 0
in O 0
plants O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
ease O 0
of O 0
use O 0
on O 0
aerial O 0
organs O 0
(such O 0
as O 0
leaves O 1
and O 0
inflorescences) O 0
and O 0
the O 0
rapid O 0
absorption O 0
of O 0
the O 0
treated O 0
tissue, O 0
facilitating O 0
subsequent O 0
analyses. O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0
provide O 0
a O 0
protocol O 0
to O 0
implement O 0
this O 0
method O 0
in O 0
maize. O 0

The O 0
approach O 0
consists O 0
of O 0
preparing O 0
dilutions O 0
of O 0
the O 0
hormones O 0
or O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0
regulators O 0
(PGRs) O 0
of O 0
interest, O 0
usually O 0
in O 0
an O 0
aqueous O 0
solution O 0
and O 0
at O 0
low O 0
concentrations, O 0
followed O 0
by O 0
application O 0
by O 0
foliar O 0
spraying O 0
using O 0
a O 0
defined O 0
treatment O 0
regimen. O 0

Users O 0
can O 0
then O 0
evaluate O 0
effects O 0
by O 0
measuring O 0
different O 0
parameters, O 0
such O 0
as O 0
stem O 1
size, O 1
flowering O 1
time, O 0
seed O 1
production, O 0
or O 0
others. O 0

The O 0
foliar O 0
spray O 0
method O 0
can O 0
easily O 0
be O 0
scaled O 0
up O 0
and O 0
automated O 0
in O 0
greenhouse O 0
and O 0
field O 0
settings, O 0
and O 0
can O 0
be O 0
used O 0
to O 0
treat O 0
plants O 0
at O 0
all O 0
developmental O 0
stages. O 0

Stalks O 0
and O 0
roots O 0
are O 0
the O 0
main O 0
battlefield O 0
for O 0
the O 0
coevolution O 0
between O 0
maize O 0
and O 0
Fusarium O 0
verticillioides. O 0

Fusarium O 0
species O 0
are O 0
the O 0
dominant O 0
cause O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
ear O 0
rot, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
also O 0
inflict O 0
serious O 0
damage O 0
to O 0
the O 0
roots O 0
and O 0
stalks. O 0

Theoretically, O 0
the O 0
organ O 0
where O 0
the O 0
host O 0
interacts O 0
with O 0
the O 0
pathogen O 0
most O 0
frequently O 0
should O 0
exhibit O 0
the O 0
highest O 0
degree O 0
of O 0
symptom-genotype O 0
correlation. O 0

Because O 0
that O 0
symptom-genotype O 0
correlation O 0
is O 0
an O 0
indicator O 0
reflecting O 0
the O 0
degree O 0
of O 0
coevolution O 0
between O 0
pathogen O 0
and O 0
its O 0
hosts. O 0

We O 0
wonder O 0
which O 0
organ O 0
is O 0
the O 0
main O 0
battlefield O 0
for O 0
the O 0
antagonism O 0
between O 0
maize O 0
and O 0
Fusarium. O 0

For O 0
this O 0
purpose, O 0
43 O 0
isolates O 0
of O 0
Fusarium O 0
were O 0
isolated O 0
from O 0
infected O 0
maize O 0
ears. O 0

Fusarium O 0
verticillioides O 0
and O 0
F. O 0

graminearum O 0
are O 0
the O 0
two O 0
dominant O 0
pathogens, O 0
accounting O 0
for O 0
44% O 0
and O 0
30%, O 0
respectively. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
14 O 0
elite O 0
maize O 0
inbreds O 0
were O 0
exposed O 0
to O 0
43 O 0
Fusarium O 0
isolates O 0
and O 0
the O 0
symptoms O 0
of O 0
ear O 0
rot, O 0
stalk O 0
rot O 0
and O 0
root O 1
rot O 1
were O 0
investigated. O 0

In O 0
general, O 0
symptoms O 0
caused O 0
by O 0
F. O 0

graminearum O 0
were O 0
significantly O 0
more O 0
severe O 0
than O 0
those O 0
caused O 0
by O 0
other O 0
Fusarium O 0
species. O 0

Surprisingly, O 0
the O 0
genotype O 0
of O 0
F. O 0

verticillioides O 0
showed O 0
a O 0
strong O 0
correlation O 0
with O 0
stalk O 0
and O 0
root O 1
rot, O 1
but O 0
not O 0
with O 0
ear O 0
rot. O 0

Accordingly, O 0
our O 0
study O 0
may O 0
provide O 0
the O 0
first O 0
evidence O 0
that O 0
the O 0
stalk O 0
and O 0
root O 0
of O 0
maize, O 0
rather O 0
than O 0
the O 0
ear, O 0
is O 0
the O 0
main O 0
battlefield O 0
for O 0
the O 0
coevolution O 0
between O 0
maize O 0
and O 0
F. O 0

In O 0

that O 0

to O 0
the O 0

We O 0
show O 0
that O 0
waxy O 0
corn O 0
is O 0
not O 0
only O 0
altered O 0
in O 0
its O 0

but O 0
that O 0
sweetness, O 0

are O 0
all O 0
significantly O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0

how O 0

In O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
some O 0

In O 0

whereas O 0
overexpressing O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0
identify O 0

Notably, O 0
that O 0

the O 0

Both O 0

Nickel O 0

an O 0
essential O 0

for O 0

However, O 0

this O 0

were O 0
used O 0
to O 0
construct O 0

The O 0

Conclusions: O 0
These O 0

encode O 0
pentatricopeptide O 0
repeat-containing O 0

(PPR O 0
proteins), O 0
which O 0
regulate O 0

The O 0
significant O 0

with O 0
these O 0

accounted O 0
for O 0
23.59% O 0

whereas O 0
the O 0

accounted O 0
for O 0
46.02% O 0

Since O 0
kernel O 0
protein O 1
synthesis O 1

occur O 0
in O 0
the O 0

this O 0

suggests O 0
that O 0
Zm00001d034933 O 0

Zm00001d029999 O 0
may O 0

the O 0

In O 0

Additionally, O 0

in O 0
arid O 0

as O 0
it O 0
allows O 0
seeds O 0
to O 0
access O 0
water O 0
stored O 0
in O 0

This O 0
approach O 0
facilitates O 0
successful O 0
germination O 0
and O 0
establishment O 0
of O 0

even O 0
in O 0
challenging O 0
environmental O 0

Previous O 0
studies O 0
have O 0
shown O 0
that O 0
the O 0
length O 0
of O 0
the O 0
maize O 0
mesocotyl O 0
is O 0
an O 0
important O 0
trait O 0
influencing O 0
deep-sowing O 0

Several O 0
factors O 0
play O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0
role O 0
in O 0
regulating O 0
mesocotyl O 0

primarily O 0
including O 0
light, O 0

Therefore, O 0
further O 0
understanding O 0
the O 0
regulatory O 0
mechanisms O 0
of O 0
mesocotyl O 0
elongation O 0
is O 0
essential O 0
for O 0
enhancing O 0
maize O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
a O 0

mainly O 0

in O 0
three O 0
pathways: O 0

following O 0
GA3 O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0

plays O 0
a O 0
positive O 0
role O 0
in O 0
promoting O 0
mesocotyl O 0
elongation O 0
under O 0
deep-sowing O 0

in O 0
the O 0
inbred O 0

DH65232. O 0

Additionally, O 0
untargeted O 0
metabolomics O 0
revealed O 0
that O 0

exhibited O 0
a O 0
higher O 0
number O 0

that O 0

Conclusions: O 0
Above O 0
all, O 0
the O 0

line O 0
DH65232 O 0
exhibits O 0
a O 0
greater O 0

due O 0
to O 0

Introduction: O 0
Seeds O 0
are O 0
fundamental O 0
to O 0
agricultural O 0
production, O 0
and O 0
their O 0
vigor O 0
affects O 0
seedling O 0

methods O 0
are O 0
crucial O 0
for O 0

methods O 0
are O 0

Thus, O 0
this O 0
study O 0
aims O 0
to O 0
develop O 0
a O 0
non-destructive O 0
method O 0
for O 0
assessing O 0

delve O 0
into O 0
the O 0

was O 0
selected O 0
to O 0
evaluate O 0
seed O 1

High O 0
and O 0
low-vigor O 0

were O 0
ultimately O 0
obtained O 0
through O 0
mixed O 0

based O 0
on O 0
the O 0
consistent O 0

Subsequently, O 0
non-destructive O 0
techniques O 0
such O 0
as O 0

distinguishing O 0
high O 0
and O 0
low-vigor O 0
maize O 0
seeds O 0
in O 0
their O 0
natural O 0
state. O 0

After O 0
determining O 0
the O 0
optimal O 0
strategy, O 0
key O 0
phenotypic O 0

were O 0
identified O 0
for O 0

Results: O 0
Among O 0
the O 0

Subsequently, O 0
four O 0

this O 0

Previous O 0
studies O 0
have O 0
shown O 0
that O 0
regulating O 0
saccharide O 0
biosynthesis O 0
is O 0
a O 0
key O 0
aspect O 0
of O 0

however, O 0
the O 0
underlying O 0
molecular O 0
mechanisms O 0
remain O 0
largely O 0
unexplored. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
overexpression O 0
of O 0
a O 0
salt-inducible O 0
galactinol O 0

gene, O 0
ZmGolS1, O 0
alleviates O 0
salt-induced O 0
growth O 0
inhibition, O 0
likely O 0
by O 0
promoting O 0
raffinose O 0
synthesis. O 0

Additionally, O 0
we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
natural O 0
variation O 0
in O 0
ZmGolS1 O 0
transcript O 0
levels O 0
contributes O 0
to O 0
the O 0

We O 0
further O 0
reveal O 0
that O 0
ZmRR18, O 0
a O 0

binds O 0
to O 0
the O 0

in O 0
the O 0

of O 0
ZmGolS1, O 0
with O 0
this O 0

increases O 0
the O 0

Moreover, O 0

polymorphism O 0
(termed O 0
SNP-302T) O 0
within O 0
the O 0
ZmGolS1 O 0

significantly O 0
reduces O 0
its O 0
binding O 0

for O 0
ZmRR18, O 0
resulting O 0
in O 0
decreased O 0

and O 0
diminished O 0
raffinose O 1

ultimately O 0
leading O 0
to O 0
a O 0
salt-hypersensitive O 0

Collectively, O 0
our O 0
findings O 0
reveal O 0
the O 0
molecular O 0
mechanisms O 0
by O 0
which O 0
the O 0
ZmRR18-ZmGolS1 O 0

enhances O 0

thereby O 0

This O 0

mechanisms O 0
associated O 0
with O 0

In O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

a O 0

Overall, O 0
the O 0

varied O 0
along O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
discovered O 0
that O 0
the O 0
GSK3-like O 0

SHAGGY-like O 0
kinase O 0
1 O 0
(ZmSK1) O 0
negatively O 0

by O 1
inhibiting O 0

Then, O 0
we O 0
determined O 0
that O 0
Cysteine-rich O 0

(ZmCPP2) O 0
interacts O 0
with O 0
ZmSK1 O 0
and O 0
enhances O 0
maize O 0
drought O 1

by O 1
inducing O 0
antioxidant O 0

ZmCPP2 O 0
is O 0
phosphorylated O 0
at O 0
Ser-250 O 0
by O 0
ZmSK1, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
dependent O 0
on O 0
ZmSK1 O 0
kinase O 0
activity O 0
and O 0
attenuates O 0
maize O 0
drought O 1

Furthermore, O 0
ZmCPP2 O 0
directly O 0
binds O 0
to O 0
the O 0
promoter O 0
of O 0
the O 0

(SOD) O 0
gene O 0
ZmSOD4, O 0
encoding O 0
an O 0

activates O 0
its O 0

ZmSK1 O 0
phosphorylating O 0
ZmCPP2 O 0
at O 0
Ser-250 O 0
represses O 0
the O 0
binding O 0
of O 0
ZmCPP2 O 0
to O 0
the O 0
ZmSOD4 O 0

Taken O 0
together, O 0
our O 0
results O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
the O 0
phosphorylation O 0
of O 0
ZmCPP2 O 0
by O 0
ZmSK1 O 0
results O 0
in O 0
decreased O 0
SOD O 1

and O 0
thus O 0
reduces O 0
drought O 1

in O 1
maize. O 0

These O 0
ﬁndings O 0
reveal O 0
a O 0
mechanism O 0
of O 0
GSK3-like O 0

strategy O 0
for O 0
boosting O 0
maize O 0
yields O 0
over O 0
the O 0

However, O 0
dense O 0
planting O 0
significantly O 0
reduces O 0
the O 0
internal O 0
light O 0

and O 0
the O 0

to O 0
far-red O 0
(R:FR) O 0

that O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
identified O 0
double O 0
B-box O 0
containing O 0
protein O 0
DBB2, O 0
a O 0
member O 0
of O 0
the O 0

that O 0
is O 0
rapidly O 0
induced O 0
by O 0
shade, O 0
as O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
plant O 1
height O 1
and O 0
SAR. O 0

Disruption O 0
of O 0
DBB2 O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
shorter O 0
internodes, O 0
reduced O 0
plant O 1
height, O 1
decreased O 0
cell O 0
elongation, O 0
and O 0
diminished O 0
sensitivity O 0
to O 0
shade O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
effects O 0
that O 0
can O 0
be O 0
largely O 0
alleviated O 0
by O 0
external O 0
treatment O 0
with O 0
gibberellins O 0
(GA). O 0

Furthermore, O 0
we O 0
discovered O 0
that O 0
DBB2 O 0
physically O 0
interacted O 0
with O 0
the O 0
transcription O 0
factor O 0
HY5, O 0
inhibiting O 0
its O 0

encoding O 0
a O 0

This O 0
interaction O 0
positively O 0
influences O 0
maize O 0
plant O 1

through O 0
the O 0

Additionally, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0

of O 0
ZmDBB2 O 0
by O 0

is O 0
mediated O 0
by O 0
the O 0

PIF4. O 0

Interestingly, O 0
DBB2 O 0
then O 0

Maize O 0
(Zea O 0

is O 0
a O 0
globally O 0
significant O 0
crop O 0

one O 0

but O 0
research O 0
on O 0
AMF O 0
symbiosis-related O 0
genes O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
is O 0
limited. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
identified O 0
a O 0
symbiosis O 0
receptor O 0
kinase O 0
in O 0
maize, O 0
named O 0
ZmSYMRK, O 0
which O 0
corresponds O 0
to O 0
the O 0
ortholog O 0
gene O 0
OsSYMRK O 0
in O 0
rice. O 0

ZmSYMRK O 0
encodes O 0
a O 0
cell O 0
membrane-localized O 0
protein O 0
kinase O 0
that O 0
is O 0
crucial O 0
for O 0
AMF O 0
colonization. O 0

We O 0
demonstrated O 0
that O 0
ZmSYMRK O 0
deletion O 0
resulted O 0
in O 0
severe O 0
defects O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
symbiosis O 0
with O 0
AMF. O 0

The O 0
colonization O 0
rates O 0
of O 0
zmsymrk O 0
mutants O 0
were O 0
significantly O 0
reduced O 0
at O 0
three O 0
different O 0
time O 0

and O 0
the O 0
colonization O 0
defects O 0
did O 0
not O 0
recover O 0
with O 0
prolonged O 0

time. O 0

Furthermore, O 0
the O 0
deletion O 0
of O 0
the O 0
ZmSYMRK O 0
gene O 0
severely O 0
affected O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0
under O 0
low O 0
phosphorus O 0
conditions, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
growth O 0
defects O 0
of O 0
the O 0
mutants O 0
were O 0
even O 0
more O 0
pronounced O 0
after O 0
symbiosis. O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
that O 0
ZmSYMRK O 0
plays O 0
a O 0
crucial O 0
role O 0
in O 0
both O 0
plant O 0
growth O 0
and O 0
the O 0

Background: O 0
Maize O 0
cultivation O 0
has O 0
considerably O 0
expanded O 0
beyond O 0
its O 0
place O 0
of O 0
origin O 0
in O 0
Central O 0

The O 0
successful O 0
adaptation O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
to O 0
temperate O 0
climates O 0
can O 0
be O 0
achieved O 0
by O 0
selecting O 0
genotypes O 0
that O 0
demonstrate O 0
tolerance O 0
to O 0
low O 0

especially O 0
in O 0

In O 0
maize, O 0
cold O 1
tolerance O 1
at O 1
the O 0
early O 0

enables O 0
early O 0
sowing, O 0

and O 0
eventually O 0
high O 0

even O 0
in O 0

Maize O 0
adaptation O 0
during O 0
early O 0
growth O 0
has O 0
not O 0
been O 0
thoroughly O 0
investigated; O 0
therefore, O 0
we O 0
tested O 0
the O 0
working O 0
hypothesis O 0
that O 0
several O 0
distinct O 0
and O 0
independent O 0

may O 0
be O 0
involved O 0

Results: O 0
We O 0
studied O 0
the O 0
effect O 0
of O 0
mild O 0
cold O 0
stress O 0
(day/night O 0
16/12 O 0
°C) O 0
on O 0
early O 0
growth O 0
stage O 0
followed O 0
by O 0
regrowth O 0
at O 0
optimal O 0
daily O 0
temperatures O 0
(24/21 O 0
°C). O 0

Automated O 0
plant O 0
phenotyping O 0
was O 0
performed O 0
on O 0
30 O 0
inbred O 0
lines O 0
selected O 0
from O 0
a O 0
diverse O 0
genetic O 0
pool O 0
during O 0
preliminary O 0
studies. O 0

As O 0
a O 0
result, O 0
we O 0
generated O 0
time O 0
series O 0
based O 0
on O 0
selected O 0
morphological O 1
parameters, O 0
spectral O 0
parameters, O 0
and O 0
spectral O 0
vegetation O 0
indices. O 0

These O 0
curves O 0
were O 0
clustered O 0
and O 0
four O 0
classes O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
with O 0
clearly O 0
contrasting O 0
growth O 0
modes O 0
and O 0
changes O 0
in O 0
their O 0
physiological O 0
status O 0
were O 0
distinguished O 0
at O 0
low O 0
temperatures O 0
and O 0
during O 0
regrowth. O 0

Two O 0
classes O 0
comprised O 0
either O 0
cold-sensitive O 0
(slow O 0
growth O 0
and O 0
poor O 0
physiological O 0
status O 0
in O 0
cold) O 0
or O 0
cold-tolerant O 0
(moderately O 0
fast O 0
growth O 0
and O 0
good O 0
physiological O 0
status O 0
in O 0
cold) O 0
lines. O 0

However, O 0
two O 0
other O 0
classes O 0
showed O 0
that O 0
growth O 0
rate O 0
and O 0
physiological O 0
status O 0
at O 0
low O 0
temperature O 0
is O 0
not O 0
necessarily O 0
related, O 0
for O 0
instance O 0
one O 0
class O 0
included O 0
lines O 0
with O 0
small O 0
seedlings O 0
but O 0
good O 0
physiological O 0
status O 0
and O 0
the O 0
other O 0
grouped O 0
seedlings O 0
with O 0
rapid O 0
growth O 0
despite O 0
poor O 0
physiological O 0
status. O 0

These O 0
classes O 0
clearly O 0
exhibited O 0
different O 0
modes O 0
of O 0
cold O 0
adaptation. O 0

Moreover, O 0
a O 0
class O 0
containing O 0
cold-sensitive O 0
inbred O 0
lines O 0
may O 0
represent O 0
a O 0
distinct O 0
and O 0
novel O 0
type O 0
of O 0
cold-adaptation O 0
strategy O 0
related O 0
to O 0
the O 0
arrest O 0
of O 0
coleoptile O 0
emerge O 0
related O 0
with O 0
ability O 0
to O 0
recover O 0
rapidly O 0
under O 0
favourable O 0
conditions. O 0

Conclusions: O 0
Our O 0
results O 0
support O 0
the O 0
hypothesis O 0
that O 0
maize O 0
may O 0
have O 0
several O 0
adaptation O 0
strategies O 0
to O 0
cold O 0
environments O 0
at O 0
early O 0
growth O 0
stages O 0
based O 0
on O 0
independent O 0
mechanisms. O 0

These O 0
findings O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
maize O 0
adaptability O 0
to O 0
adverse O 0
environments O 0
is O 0
likely O 0
more O 0
complex O 0
than O 0
previously O 0
understood. O 0

Experimental O 0
evolution O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
with O 0
replicated O 0
divergent O 0
selection O 0
identifies O 0
two O 0
plant-height-associated O 0
regions. O 0

Experimental O 0
evolution O 0
studies O 0
are O 0
common O 0
in O 0
agricultural O 0
research, O 0
where O 0
they O 0
are O 0
often O 0
deemed O 0
"long-term O 0
selection." O 0
These O 0
are O 0
often O 0
used O 0
to O 0
perform O 0
selection O 0
mapping, O 0
which O 0
involves O 0
identifying O 0
markers O 0
that O 0
were O 0
putatively O 0
under O 0
selection O 0
based O 0
on O 0
finding O 0
signals O 0
of O 0
selection O 0
left O 0
in O 0
the O 0

A O 0
challenge O 0
of O 0
previous O 0
selection O 0
mapping O 0
studies, O 0
especially O 0
in O 0
agricultural O 0
research, O 0
has O 0
been O 0
the O 0
specification O 0
of O 0
robust O 0
significance O 0
thresholds. O 0

This O 0
is O 0
in O 0
large O 0
part O 0
because O 0
long-term O 0
selection O 0
studies O 0
in O 0
crops O 0
have O 0
rarely O 0
included O 0
replication. O 0

Usually, O 0
significance O 0
thresholds O 0
in O 0
long-term O 0
selection O 0
experiments O 0
are O 0
based O 0
on O 0
outliers O 0
from O 0
an O 0
empirical O 0
distribution. O 0

This O 0
approach O 0
is O 0
prone O 0
to O 0
missing O 0
true O 0
positives O 0
or O 0
including O 0
false O 0
positives. O 0

Under O 0
laboratory O 0
conditions O 0
with O 0
model O 0
species, O 0
replicated O 0
selection O 0
has O 0
been O 0
shown O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
powerful O 0
tool, O 0
especially O 0
for O 0
the O 0
specification O 0
of O 0
significance O 0
thresholds. O 0

Another O 0
challenge O 0
is O 0
that O 0
commonly O 0
used O 0
single-marker-based O 0
statistics O 0
may O 0
identify O 0
neutral O 0
linked O 0
loci O 0
which O 0
have O 0
hitchhiked O 0
along O 0
with O 0
regions O 0
that O 0
are O 0
actually O 0
under O 0
selection. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
conducted O 0
divergent, O 0
replicated O 0
selection O 0
for O 0
short O 0

in O 0
a O 0
random-mating O 0
maize O 0
population O 0
under O 0

field O 0
conditions. O 0

Selection O 0
of O 0
the O 0
5% O 0
tallest O 0
and O 0
shortest O 0
plants O 0
was O 0
conducted O 0
for O 0
3 O 0

Significance O 0
thresholds O 0
were O 0

using O 0
the O 0

applied O 0
to O 0
a O 0

(FSTSum). O 0

Overall, O 0
we O 0
found O 0
2 O 0
significant O 0
regions O 0
putatively O 0
under O 0

One O 0

alleviated O 0
the O 0

Transcriptomic O 0

Conversely, O 0
exogenous O 0

and O 0
further O 0
enhanced O 0

Furthermore, O 0

for O 0
the O 0

Here, O 0
we O 0

can O 0
produce O 0

despite O 0
reducing O 0
the O 0

dek570-1 O 0
plants O 0
are O 0

they O 0
can O 0

In O 0

reduces O 0
the O 0

consistent O 0
with O 0

But O 0
unlike O 0
the O 0

More O 0

is O 0
that O 0
Dek570-1 O 0
is O 0
not O 0
only O 0
located O 0
in O 0

Correspondingly, O 0
the O 0
editing O 0
at O 0

is O 0
a O 0

Background/Objectives: O 0
The O 0
germination O 0
process O 0
initiates O 0
an O 0

of O 0

which O 0

as O 0

responses O 0
in O 0
neighboring O 0

yet O 0
in O 0
many O 0
cases O 0
the O 0
mechanism O 0
behind O 0
this O 0

is O 0
not O 0

Volatile O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
investigate O 0
the O 0

of O 0
volatile O 0
indole, O 0
a O 0
known O 0
priming O 0
signal O 0
in O 0
maize O 0
(Zea O 0

to O 0
determine O 0
if O 0
its O 0
conversion O 0
to O 0
other O 0
compounds O 0
could O 0
play O 0
a O 0
role O 0
in O 0
its O 0
priming O 0
of O 0
defenses. O 0

We O 0
identified O 0
benzoxazinoids O 0
as O 0
major O 0
products O 0
from O 0
volatile O 0
indole O 0
using O 0
heavy O 0
isotope-labeled O 0

Pathway O 0
of O 0
Origin O 0
Determination O 0
in O 0
Untargeted O 0

We O 0
then O 0
used O 0
benzoxazinoid O 0
biosynthesis O 0
maize O 0
mutants O 0
to O 0
investigate O 0
their O 0
role O 0
in O 0
indole-mediated O 0
priming. O 0

Labeled O 0
volatile O 0
indole O 0
was O 0
converted O 0
into O 0
DIMBOA-glucoside O 0
in O 0
a O 0
bx2 O 0
(benzoxazinone O 0
synthesis2)-dependent O 0
manner. O 0

The O 0
bx2 O 0
mutant O 0
plants O 0
showed O 0
elevated O 0
green O 0
leaf O 0
volatile O 0
(GLV) O 0
production O 0
in O 0
response O 0
to O 0
wounding O 0
and O 0
Spodoptera O 0
frugiperda O 0
regurgitant O 0
irrespective O 0
of O 0
indole O 0
exposure. O 0

Thus, O 0
volatile O 0
indole O 0
is O 0
converted O 0
into O 0
benzoxazinoids, O 0
and O 0
part O 0
of O 0
its O 0
priming O 0
mechanism O 0
may O 0
be O 0
due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
enhanced O 0
production O 0
of O 0
these O 0
phytoanticipins. O 0

However, O 0
indole-mediated O 0
enhanced O 0
GLV O 0
production O 0
does O 0
not O 0
rely O 0
on O 0
the O 0
conversion O 0
of O 0
indole O 0
to O 0
benzoxazinoids, O 0
so O 0
indole O 0
also O 0
has O 0
other O 0
signaling O 0
functions. O 0

one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0

ZmCPK39 O 0

can O 0
be O 0
conferred O 0

that O 0
the O 0

has O 0
focused O 0
on O 0
the O 0

To O 0
uncover O 0
how O 0

we O 0
performed O 0
a O 0
phosphoproteomic O 0

on O 0
maize O 0

by O 0
using O 0
multiplex O 0

of O 0
1594 O 0

A O 0
functional O 0

analysis O 0
of O 0
the O 0

revealed O 0
that O 0
the O 0

were O 0
associated O 0
with O 0

The O 0

Therefore, O 0
the O 0

Interplay O 0

a O 0
continuum O 0
of O 0

Classical O 0

due O 0

the O 0

This O 0

Often, O 0

these O 0

multiplies O 0
the O 0

the O 0

but O 0
occasionally O 0
the O 0

In O 0
this O 0

we O 0
used O 0

This O 0

These O 0

revealed O 0
an O 0
unexpected O 0

showed O 0
enhanced O 0

was O 0

These O 0

play O 0
a O 0

in O 0

Siblicide O 0
between O 0

Evolutionarily, O 0

This O 0

is O 0
detrimental O 0
agronomically. O 0

However, O 0
the O 0

between O 0
early-fertilized O 0
and O 0
unfertilized O 0

in O 0

caused O 0

degradation O 0
and O 0
senescence O 0
of O 0
unfertilized O 0

reducing O 0

These O 0
