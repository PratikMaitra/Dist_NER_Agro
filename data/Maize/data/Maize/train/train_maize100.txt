Anthranilate-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate O 0

the O 0

which O 0
usually O 0

This O 0
inhibition O 0
of O 0
the O 0
enzyme O 0
which O 0
utilizes O 0
anthranilate O 0
would O 0
also O 0
lead O 0
to O 0

Apparently O 0
the O 0

anthranilate O 0
leads O 0
to O 0
the O 0

Under O 0
the O 0

employed, O 0
changes O 0
in O 0

as O 0

as O 0

in O 0

In O 0
contrast, O 0
while O 0
transcript O 0

for O 0
most O 0

in O 0
all O 0

In O 0
one O 0
case, O 0
the O 0

indicated O 0
that O 0

These O 0
two O 0

responded O 0
differentially O 0
to O 0

(levels O 0

the O 0

for O 0
the O 0

remained O 0

This O 0

that O 0

in O 0
the O 0

informative O 0
method O 0
for O 0
reconstructing O 0
the O 0
early O 0
events O 0
of O 0
organ O 0

We O 0
traced O 0
the O 0
patterns O 0
of O 0
cell O 0
division O 0
during O 0
maize O 0
anther O 0
development O 0
by O 0
inducing O 0
sector O 0
boundaries O 0
that O 0
preceded O 0
the O 0
earliest O 0
events O 0
of O 0
anther O 0
initiation. O 0

In O 0
doing O 0
this, O 0
we O 0
were O 0
able O 0
to O 0
estimate O 0
the O 0
smallest O 0
number O 0
of O 0
cells O 0
that O 0
are O 0
fated O 0
to O 0
form O 0

characteristic O 0
cell O 0

patterns O 0
that O 0
occur O 0
during O 0

and O 0
the O 0

between O 0
the O 0
pre-existing O 0

and O 0
the O 0
final O 0

mature O 0
anther. O 0

Four O 0
general O 0
conclusions O 0
are O 0
made: O 0
(1) O 0
anthers O 0
are O 0
initiated O 0
from O 0
small O 0
groups O 0
of O 0
12 O 0
or O 0
fewer O 0
cells O 0
in O 0
each O 0
of O 0
two O 0
floral O 0
meristematic O 0
layers; O 0
(2) O 0
the O 0
early O 0
growth O 0
of O 0
the O 0
anther O 0
is O 0
more O 0
like O 0
a O 0
shoot O 0
than O 0
a O 0
glume O 0
or O 0
leaf; O 0
(3) O 0
cell O 0
ancestry O 0
does O 0
not O 0
dictate O 0
basic O 0
structure O 0
and O 0
(4) O 0
the O 0
orientation O 0
of O 0
initial O 0
cells O 0
predicts O 0
the O 0
orientation O 0
of O 0
the O 0
four O 0
pollen-containing O 0
microsporangia, O 0
which O 0
define O 0
the O 0
axes O 0
of O 0
symmetry O 0
on O 0
the O 0
mature O 0
anther. O 0

The O 0
final O 0
point O 0
is O 0
discussed O 0
with O 0
other O 0
data, O 0
and O 0
an O 0
explanation O 0
involving O 0
a O 0
'structural O 0
template' O 0
is O 0
invoked. O 0

The O 0
idea O 0
is O 0
that O 0
the O 0
orientation O 0
of O 0
initial O 0
cells O 0
within O 0
the O 0
floral O 0
meristem O 0
establishes O 0
an O 0
architectural O 0
pattern O 0
into O 0
which O 0
anther O 0
cells O 0
are O 0
recruited O 0
without O 0
regard O 0
to O 0
their O 0
cellular O 0
lineages. O 0

The O 0
structural O 0
template O 0
hypothesis O 0
may O 0
prove O 0
to O 0
be O 0
generally O 0
applicable O 0
to O 0
problems O 0
of O 0

in O 0

Maize O 0

Maize O 0

partitions O 0
CO2 O 0
fixation O 0
in O 0
two O 0
consecutive, O 0
spatially O 0

thus O 0
eliminating O 0

The O 0
crucial O 0

for O 0
primary O 0
CO2 O 0

is O 0
a O 0
C4-specific O 0

pepcZm3B, O 0
in O 0

reported O 0
here. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
shown, O 0
in O 0
a O 0
transient O 0

that O 0
this O 0
tissue-specific O 0

is O 0
mainly O 0
controlled O 0
by O 0
their O 0

Analyses O 0

revealed O 0
the O 0
redundant O 0
nature O 0

a O 0

which O 0
is O 0
repeated O 0
four O 0

No O 0

Although O 0

the O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
C4 O 0
PEPC O 0
and O 0
other O 0
photosynthetic O 0

in O 0

this O 0

This O 0

that O 0

The O 0
sequence O 0
of O 0
the O 0

(MA16) O 0
predicts O 0
that O 0
it O 0

it O 0

we O 0

Previous O 0

Unlike O 0

conclude O 0
that O 0

almost O 0

that O 0
the O 0

the O 0

As O 0
a O 0
result, O 0
precise O 0
excision O 0
of O 0
this O 0

should O 0
restore O 0

The O 0
fact O 0
that O 0

indicates O 0
that O 0

Previous O 0

have O 0
concluded O 0
that O 0
restoration O 0
of O 0
Mutator O 0
transposon O 0
activity O 0
by O 0
crossing O 0
inactive O 0

back O 0

transient, O 0
and O 0
depends O 0
upon O 0
the O 0
sex O 0
of O 0
the O 0
inactive O 0
parent. O 0

Further, O 0
it O 0
has O 0
been O 0
proposed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
inactive O 0
system O 0
is O 0
dominant O 0
to O 0
the O 0
active O 0
system, O 0
with O 0
the O 0
dominance O 0
possibly O 0
mediated O 0
through O 0
a O 0
negative O 0
regulatory O 0
factor O 0
that O 0
is O 0
preferentially O 0
transmitted O 0
through O 0
the O 0
female. O 0

In O 0
this O 0
study, O 0
we O 0
have O 0
examined O 0
the O 0

of O 0

and O 0

carrying O 0
an O 0

in O 0
the O 0

We O 0
find O 0
that O 0
transmission O 0
of O 0
Mu O 0
transposon O 0
activity O 0
to O 0
non-Mu O 0
plants O 0
can O 0
occur O 0
at O 0
high O 0
rates O 0
through O 0

but O 0
individual O 0
cases O 0
of O 0
decreased O 0
transmission O 0
through O 0
the O 0

were O 0
observed. O 0

We O 0
also O 0
find O 0
that O 0
in O 0
crosses O 0
between O 0
inactive-Mu O 0
and O 0
active-Mu O 0
plants, O 0
reactivation O 0
was O 0
efficient O 0
as O 0
well O 0
as O 0
heritable, O 0
regardless O 0
of O 0
the O 0
sex O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Similar O 0
results O 0
were O 0
obtained O 0
whether O 0
the O 0
inactivation O 0
occurred O 0
in O 0
an O 0

or O 0
a O 0

In O 0
all O 0
cases O 0
examined, O 0
loss O 0
of O 0
Mu O 0
transposon O 0
activity O 0
was O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
hypermethylation O 0
of O 0
Mu O 0
elements, O 0
and O 0
reactivation O 0
was O 0
correlated O 0
with O 0
their O 0
demethylation. O 0

Our O 0
results O 0
indicate O 0
that O 0
an O 0
inactive O 0
Mu O 0
system O 0
does O 0
not O 0
exhibit O 0
dominance O 0
over O 0
an O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
that O 0
contrary O 0
to O 0
current O 0
models, O 0
inactivation O 0
and O 0
its O 0
maintenance O 0
is O 0
not O 0

The O 0

that O 0
many O 0

are O 0
conserved O 0
between O 0
these O 0

Estimates O 0

that O 0
a O 0

duplicated O 0
in O 0
the O 0

This O 0

that O 0
the O 0

The O 0
pattern O 0
of O 0
conserved O 0

between O 0
maize O 0

is O 0
such O 0
that O 0
most O 0

are O 0
composed O 0
of O 0
loci O 0
that O 0
map O 0

This O 0

is O 0
consistent O 0
with O 0
the O 0
hypothesized O 0
ancient O 0
polyploid O 0
origin O 0
of O 0

is O 0
inverted O 0

These O 0
may O 0
have O 0
arisen O 0
from O 0
either O 0

or O 0
intrachromosomal O 0

We O 0
found O 0
no O 0
evidence O 0
for O 0
large O 0
interchromosomal O 0

Overall, O 0
the O 0
data O 0
suggest O 0
that O 0
the O 0
primary O 0
processes O 0
involved O 0
in O 0
divergence O 0
of O 0
the O 0
maize O 0

mutations O 0
of O 0
the O 0
Knotted-1 O 0

the O 0

By O 0
analyzing O 0
Kn1 O 0
transcripts O 0
and O 0
KN1 O 0

we O 0
show O 0
that O 0
the O 0

not O 0

at O 0
high O 0
levels O 0
during O 0
the O 0

Instead, O 0

in O 0
apical O 0

of O 0
vegetative O 0

floral O 0

and O 0
is O 0
downregulated O 0
as O 0

and O 0

Kn1 O 0
is O 0
also O 0
expressed O 0
in O 0
relatively O 0
undifferentiated O 0
cells O 0
within O 0
developing O 0
vascular O 0

as O 0

in O 0
immature, O 0
unelongated O 0

of O 0

In O 0
Kn1-N2 O 0

quantitative, O 0

not O 0
qualitative O 0
differences O 0
are O 0

in O 0
Kn1 O 0

and O 0
KN1 O 0

consistent O 0
with O 0
previous O 0
observations O 0
that O 0
dominant O 0
Kn1 O 0
mutations O 0
map O 0
to O 0
non-coding O 0
regions O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Kn1 O 0
is O 0
expressed O 0
ectopically O 0
in O 0
vascular O 0
bundles O 0
within O 0
developing O 0
mutant O 0
leaves O 0
in O 0
a O 0

correlates O 0
with O 0
the O 0
phenotypic O 0
alterations O 0
produced O 0
by O 0
the O 0
Kn1-N2 O 0

Thus, O 0
Kn1 O 0
apparently O 0
alters O 0
the O 0
fates O 0

which O 0
it O 0

from O 0
an O 0
early O 0
stage O 0
of O 0
leaf O 0
development. O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
these O 0

we O 0
hypothesize O 0
that O 0
Kn1 O 0
functions O 0
in O 0
its O 0
wild-type O 0
context O 0
as O 0
a O 0

Using O 0

the O 0

than O 0
the O 0
respective O 0
homozygote O 0
(with O 0
only O 0
one O 0

suggesting O 0
not O 0
only O 0
overdominance O 0
(or O 0

but O 0
also O 0
that O 0
these O 0
detected O 0
QTLs O 0
play O 0
a O 0
significant O 0
role O 0
in O 0

This O 0
conclusion O 0

by O 0
a O 0

Both O 0

We O 0

Each O 0

We O 0
conclude O 0
the O 0

First, O 0
the O 0
mutants O 0
act O 0
in O 0
particular O 0

in O 0
the O 0

Third, O 0
the O 0
mutants O 0

retard O 0
developmental O 0
stage O 0
transitions. O 0

Fourth, O 0
three O 0
and O 0
probably O 0
four O 0
of O 0
the O 0
seven O 0

All O 0

in O 0

that O 0

At O 0
least O 0
two O 0

9-B. O 0

The O 0
system O 0
operates O 0
by O 0
stabilizing O 0
univalent O 0
B-type O 0

It O 0
allows O 0
the O 0
univalents O 0
to O 0
migrate O 0
to O 0
one O 0
pole O 0
in O 0
meiosis, O 0
despite O 0
the O 0
absence O 0
of O 0
a O 0
pairing O 0

The O 0
findings O 0
reported O 0
here O 0
are O 0
the O 0

evidence O 0
for O 0
genetic O 0
control O 0
of O 0
meiotic O 0

by O 0
a O 0
B O 0
chromosome. O 0

However, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
proposed O 0
that O 0
the O 0
practice O 0
of O 0
suppressing O 0
meiotic O 0
loss O 0
is O 0
common O 0
to O 0
the O 0

all O 0
species. O 0

The O 0
need O 0
to O 0
suppress O 0
meiotic O 0

results O 0
from O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
B O 0

are O 0
frequently O 0
unpaired O 0

to O 0
very O 0

one O 0
or O 0
more O 0
of O 0
the O 0
following O 0
methods O 0

(a) O 0
regular O 0

of O 0
univalent O 0

It O 0
is O 0
useful O 0

different O 0
ways O 0
by O 0
which O 0
the O 0

is O 0
regulated: O 0
developmental O 0
stage-transition O 0
mechanisms O 0
and O 0
time-to-flowering O 0
mechanisms. O 0

The O 0
existence O 0
of O 0
both O 0
mechanisms O 0
is O 0
indicated O 0
by O 0
the O 0
behavior O 0
of O 0
various O 0

Shoot O 0

are O 0
defined O 0
by O 0
dominant O 0

representing O 0
at O 0

four O 0

each O 0

transitions O 0
from O 0
juvenile O 0
shoot O 0
stages O 0

In O 0

in O 0
at O 0
least O 0
seven O 0

have O 0
similar O 0

but O 0
the O 0

rather O 0
than O 0
the O 0

is O 0
the O 0

(and O 0
at O 0

The O 0

that O 0

The O 0
Mutator O 0
system O 0
of O 0
maize O 0
consists O 0
of O 0
more O 0
than O 0
eight O 0
different O 0
classes O 0
of O 0
transposable O 0
elements O 0
each O 0
of O 0
which O 0
can O 0
be O 0
found O 0
in O 0
multiple O 0

All O 0
Mu O 0
elements O 0
share O 0
the O 0
approximately O 0
220-bp O 0
terminal O 0

repeats, O 0
whereas O 0
each O 0
distinct O 0
element O 0
class O 0
is O 0
defined O 0
by O 0
its O 0
unique O 0
internal O 0
sequences. O 0

The O 0
regulation O 0
of O 0

of O 0
this O 0

has O 0
been O 0
difficult O 0
to O 0
elucidate O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
multigenic O 0
inheritance. O 0

Here O 0
we O 0
present O 0
genetic O 0
experiments O 0
which O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
there O 0
is O 0
a O 0
single O 0
locus, O 0
MuR1, O 0
which O 0
can O 0
regulate O 0
the O 0

We O 0
describe O 0
the O 0

members O 0
of O 0
a O 0
novel O 0
class O 0
of O 0
Mu O 0
elements, O 0
MuR, O 0
and O 0
demonstrate O 0
that O 0
a O 0
member O 0
of O 0
the O 0
class O 0
is O 0
the O 0
regulator O 0
of O 0
Mutator O 0
activity, O 0
MuR1. O 0

This O 0
conclusion O 0
is O 0
based O 0
on O 0
several O 0
criteria: O 0
MuR1 O 0
activity O 0
and O 0
a O 0
MuR-homologous O 0
restriction O 0
fragment O 0
cosegregate; O 0
when O 0
MuR1 O 0
undergoes O 0
a O 0
duplicative O 0
transposition, O 0
an O 0
additional O 0
MuR O 0
restriction O 0
fragment O 0
is O 0
observed, O 0
and O 0
MuR1 O 0
activity O 0
and O 0
the O 0
cosegregating O 0
MuR O 0
fragment O 0
are O 0
simultaneously O 0
lost O 0
within O 0
clonal O 0

In O 0

the O 0
MuR O 0
element O 0
hybridizes O 0
to O 0
transcripts O 0

Our O 0

that O 0
